86516|~|How conversation on suicide can lead to silence|~|   August 4 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Note: This column is not intended as a slur to Madison Holleran, her family, friends and anyone who continues to grieve for her. I was as numbed by her story as anyone else who read it. Any life that is lost to suicide is one worth mourning for, which is ultimately the point I am trying to make, and I hope I have been able to communicate that point with clarity, honesty and respect. I sincerely apologize and accept fault if I have not. We don’t write about suicide often. We don’t talk about it often, either. But every so often, an article on suicide “epidemics,” “crises” or “clusters” on college campuses gets published.  The article gets shared across a variety of social media platforms. People applaud the instigation of a conversation around suicide. After a few days, that conversation comes to a halt – radio silence once again. The same trend applies to a recent New York Times article titled “Campus Suicide and the Pressure of Perfection.” Incoming college freshmen, graduated seniors, teachers and religious leaders shared the post. But once again, the circulation and conversation that followed ceased before it had any real opportunity to begin. The story of Madison Holleran serves as a gateway into having a conversation about college campus suicides, but not one we’ve already had. Her story is not unbeknownst to us. ESPN’s expose on Holleran entitled “Split Image,” published back in May, was widely shared. It rocked the public. She was well-known and well-liked, with a bright future ahead of her – or so everyone said. This track star, sorority sister, Ivy League student at the University of Pennsylvania had a pristine image that people could not fathom was a façade when she took her own life in January of 2014. According to Associated Press (AP) guidelines, suicides should generally not be reported on. They are considered a private, not public, matter. So why was Madison the exception? Over the past 15 months, six students have taken their lives at the University of Pennsylvania, reports The Chronicle of Higher Education. But the one question that begs to be asked, one that can be uncomfortable for many, is why was only Madison Holleran’s story shared so much and in such great depth? Five other Penn students tragically took their lives that same year – five suicides that I was not aware of until a friend messaged me on Facebook after I shared that Times article. She actually started a conversation on suicide. Alice Wiley was a graduate student at the School of Social Policy & Practice. Wendy Shung was a graduate student at the School of Education. Pulkit Singh was a junior at the Wharton School of Business. Elvis Hatcher was a sophomore studying mathematics. Timothy Hamlett was a junior track star. But these lives lost did not inundate our newsfeeds. Most people do not even know these lives were lost. What makes one individual’s story newsworthy, and another’s not? Could it be that Madison’s Instagram presence provided a perfect image which we chose to believe, preferred to believe, were all too comfortable to believe? If so, there are hundreds of students at Princeton alone who could say the same about themselves. I, for one, undoubtedly can, and I’m certainly not alone. That disparity between a social media presence and reality is undeniably an important yet overlooked fact, but was Wiley’s social media presence not enough? Could it be that Shung’s story was too expected or mainstream, of an Asian-American daughter, potentially exposed to standard parental and cultural expectations, in a culture where being subject to stress, pressure and adversity by many is considered the norm? Could it be that Singh’s story was too disturbing, one of him and his younger brother having found his parents slain in their New York apartment seven years ago, perpetually haunted by his parents’ unsolved murders? Could it be that Hatcher was not the archetypal fraternity brother, with an eccentric look and taste in fashion, as the fraternity’s treasurer and IT pundit? Could it be that Hamlett’s story was just another quotidian story about a track star turned drug-abuser, as he began taking performance enhancing athletic supplements? Or could it be a question of race? Hamlett was black, Shung Asian-American, Singh Indian-American. How about a question of the Ivy League facet? This same year saw four suicides at William and Mary, four at Tulane, five at Appalachian State University – and those were just the ones I could find online. In fact, according to Emory University’s public statistics, more than 1000 suicides happen on college campuses nationwide each year. Where is the coverage on each of those lives lost? If suicide is no longer a private matter in today’s age of mass media, who has the discretion to pick and choose whose stories are told? I’m not advocating for greater media coverage on suicide; after all, this is a deeply personal issue for many individuals and families. I am rather questioning the disparity in media coverage and inviting a conversation on how we treat suicide and the lives taken by it. We need to have a conversation on a subject that has been stigmatized for too long, but we cannot have that conversation if the media is the one to control the discourse.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

86260|~|Princeton privilege|~|   May 29 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|I complain about Princeton. A lot. Only a week into summer, I still feel like I am mentally recovering from a caffeine-fueled, stress-and-anxiety-filled daze from finals. With multiple exams, problem sets and papers, it becomes easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. In the long run, the difference between an A- and a B+ is extremely insignificant, but in the moment, it can seem overwhelmingly important. These smaller issues (or “first world problems” as some of my friends would jokingly say) snowball, building up to the point that it sometimes feels overwhelming. As Princeton students and alumni, despite the stress, we are truly lucky. Yet sometimes I completely forget that. This point especially came across to me after attending the University sponsored talk “Wealth Imbalance — What Does It Mean?” moderated by Professor Patricia Fernandez-Kelly that discussed the state of wealth inequality in the U.S. The statistics are shocking. Since the late 1970s, incomes have been stagnant, while the richest in society have been accumulating more and more wealth. The top .1 percent of the population, which held 7 percent of the wealth in 1978, now holds 22 percent. While we are celebrating with three nights of revelry and school spirit, millions are still struggling to get by day to day.   In light of this, the natural question is what can be done to reduce it. Almost all the panelists, despite their different backgrounds and views, agreed that providing quality education is an essential step in achieving greater socioeconomic mobility. The biggest way to move forward is to gain the advanced skills that are suitable for a 21st century workforce, matching the supply with the demand. Coincidentally, production of strong education is considered Princeton’s best quality. With a generous financial aid package, an enormous financial endowment and top quality professors, Princeton is able to offer a great education that enables students to gain these skills. Princeton is truly the golden ticket in terms of economic mobility. The composition of the board itself is a true testament to what the University’s alumni are capable of achieving. From a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to a famous tech investor to a Governor of the Federal Reserve, many of these men used their Princeton education to achieve great things. Going to Princeton is much more likely to place you with the “haves,” rather than the “have-nots.” Granted, that is not to say that Princeton students are incapable of having “real” problems. The Princeton Hidden Minority Council, created as a resource for first generation and low-income students, demonstrates the fact that even low-income students at Princeton constantly face difficulties. However, attending the wealth imbalance event, I could not help but realize how many of my own problems are fairly minor. Three years ago, I walked across a stage to receive my high school diploma with three hundred and thirty of my friends and classmates, many of whom I had grown up with since elementary school or even earlier. At the time, many of my friends received similar test scores and grades, yet many of us ended up at vastly different colleges by circumstance and chance. At first, what college we went to did not seem all that important. Entering this summer, however, I have started to realize how divergent three years can really be. While some of my high school friends are going to be working at investment banks, aerospace manufactures and software companies in the next few months, others are still busing at restaurants or cashiering at home. Granted, there were some differences among us, but rather than bridging these differences, they have accentuated them. Princeton lays the foundation for a great education. Reunions is truly reflective of not only the things we learned and the skills we obtained, but also the great memories and friendships from our time here too. Despite all of the complaining I may have had only a few weeks ago, in the middle of this spectacular weekend, I cannot help but feel truly appreciative of Princeton and the privileges that I have gotten out of it.|~|Ben Dinovelli is a Wilson School major from Mystic, Conn.

86248|~|The American siege on science|~|   May 29 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|On Friday afternoon, an Alumni-Faculty Forum titled “Science Under Attack!” convened with a panel of five graduates to discuss the national mood regarding science and science literacy in the country today. Seth Shostak ’65, senior astronomer and director of the Center for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Research, notes that there is a culture of deprioritizing science and scientists as important leaders. He described the current state of science not as “under attack,” but rather as “under siege.“ There isn’t as much an active debate against science as there is an inaccessibility to scientific literacy and education. “Our heroes are not intellectuals,” Shostak said of the American prioritization of explorers and politicians. “Our heroes fought bears and were able to survive, but they were not intellectuals.” This is, according to Shostak, compounded by the fact that teachers and educators are not valued as highly in the United States as they are in other parts of the world, and the fact that there is a poor understanding of science in politics. “How many scientists are even left in Congress?” he asked. (The answer, by the way, is two. Out of 535 senators and representatives, just two are scientists.) Zackory Burns ’10, a Hellman Fellow in Science and Technology Policy at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, added that words matter, especially when we live in a time and place where an understanding of science is linked so closely with policy-making decisions. “No one should ask whether one ‘believes’ in climate change,” said Burns. “The question should be: What is the Republican solution to climate change?” Burns noted that he spoke on behalf of himself, and not on behalf of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. This offering up of untrained opinions is the core problem that comes with having only two scientists in Congress. The others aren’t qualified in any way to discuss the science of things like climate change, but they try anyway. It shouldn’t be relevant whether or not congressmen personally “believe” in it; it only matters what they will actively do to halt the effects it has had on the planet already. Debra Meloy Elmegreen ’75, professor of astronomy at Vassar College, and Peter Brown ’70, former Editor-in-Chief of The Sciences and Natural History magazines, expressed sentiments about the poor state of science literacy in the country, particularly in children. Science, technology, engineering and education in schools has not caught up to STEM education in parts of Europe and Asia. The larger goal with respect to this, however, shouldn’t be to teach members of society scientific facts, like the definition of the Higgs Boson or the practical function of a particle collider. It is more important and more useful to teach scientific thinking. It is more important to teach kids how to engage critically with information and data in order to draw conclusions organically, and to continuously analyze existing conclusions for veracity from an educated, rather than herd-mentality, standpoint. Part of the necessity for this comes from a phenomenon described by Kaiser Fung ’95, former head of data for Vimeo and Sirius XM Radio. Fung speaks about the fact that there is so much data publicly available these days that it’s easy for anyone to look at raw numbers and draw their own conclusions. This, in itself is good, but it becomes a problem when we blindly accept others’ conclusions as fact just because they are steeped in science. Even when data is analyzed using correct statistical methodology, it is still not fact. Fung noted tylervigen.com, a website that uses correct statistical methodology to make spurious correlations: for example, there is a correlation of 99.79 percent between U.S. spending on science, space and technology, and suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation. Despite the statistics, it is highly unlikely that NASA is causing people to kill themselves.|~|
85899|~|Letter from the Editor|~|   May 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Anna Mazarakis|~|   Editor-in-Chief     |~|When I introduced the 139th Managing Board of The Daily Princetonian in my first Letter from the Editor in February, I wrote that the new group of editors planned to work constructively with the Princeton community throughout our year at the helm of the paper. Throughout the course of this last semester, we have been hard at work in our newsroom producing content. We covered protests and petitions, referenda and reforms, admission and academics. We sought to share the facts behind controversies and events with our readers, and we sought the perspectives and voices of members of our community. I wrote this in my last letter, but I think it bears repeating: This newspaper cannot operate in a vacuum; we are nothing without you, the Princeton community. That is why we are asking for your feedback. Today we are introducing a reader survey through which we would like to learn more about how you connect to us. We want to ensure that the content is easily accessible to our readers and we want to constantly strive to ensure that our content is what you want to see and of the highest quality. All feedback is welcome through our online reader survey, which can be found at this link: goo.gl/7yX1sV. In addition to this feedback form, we encourage you to send us an email with your thoughts on our content throughout the year at eic@dailyprincetonian.com. This is the last paper we will print during the semester, but we will publish again during Reunions. We will then be back to our regular publishing schedule in September when classes start. Until then, we will continue to publish online throughout the summer. Keep in touch!|~|Anna Mazarakis, a politics major from Montclair, N.J., is the Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Princetonian.

85896|~|Why I still have hope|~|   May 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Anonymous|~|None|~|Editor’s note: The author of this column was granted anonymity due to the intensely personal nature of the events described previously. I saw an anonymous post on Tiger Admirers the other day that broke my heart. Someone wrote, “I literally have heard 0 good things about [Counseling and Psychological Services]. But I’m scared that without seeing someone I might hurt myself or worse. I have periods where it gets pretty bleak and I don’t think very straight…” To that student: this column is the one good thing about CPS that you have not yet heard. It’s the reason you should not hesitate to find help if you feel you need it. Sometimes it’s really easy for me to get frustrated at the University administration for various things, and I’m tempted to write them off as stubborn individuals only looking out for their own interests. But despite my feelings, I don’t think that’s actually the case. I admit it sounds like a non sequitur — but I know it’s not the case because they made me cry. The tears came when I opened up one of the forms that I needed to fill out to apply for readmission to the University after taking a mental health-related leave of absence. The “Questions for Treatment Providers” form, previously a monstrosity of 14 detailed, invasive and alienating questions that prompted my op-ed last year, now only contained three questions: dates and types of treatment, thoughts about safety and simple recommendations for future treatment. Three small questions. That was it. I cried out of relief, out of gratitude, and because I had a restored sense of hope in our administration. I almost couldn’t believe it — they actually responded to our requests for mental health reform. We asked them to demonstrate trust in the counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists that students would have seen during their year off; they did exactly that by radically revising the readmission form. We asked them for more transparency; they released a detailed FAQ about the mental health withdrawal and readmissions processes, and they set up recurring office hours open to any student who might have questions or concerns. They showed their commitment to providing quality mental health services by increasing their hours of operation, including mental health programming during freshman orientation, reintroducing workshops about how to help a struggling friend and more. Last year in my column, I wrote to the administration: “I understand that you are concerned for students who find themselves in these difficult situations and that you have to worry about liability issues, but the reality is that mental health’s stigma in our society presents an enormous obstacle that prevents students from reaching out. Please understand that Princeton’s current policies and procedures surrounding mental health and withdrawals do little to alleviate the fears of students who consider seeking help (or not). And though you may believe you have the students’ best interests in mind, you may in fact be contributing to the problem.” They listened. They considered our appeals. They changed. And I really appreciate that. Just one small caveat — I still had to be “evaluated” by someone at CPS after returning to campus in February, and I was encouraged (but not absolutely required) to sign a release form that would allow the CPS personnel to discuss a limited amount of information with the administration. I opted to sign the form (as a show of good faith), but even this caveat wasn’t a bad experience at all; the evaluator assured me she would only tell them things I was comfortable with her sharing. We spent the last 15 minutes of the evaluation going through what she would say, nearly word for word, until I felt okay with it. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not arguing that the administration has responded perfectly in every way or that there’s nothing left to be done. For example, I know there has been some disappointment with this year’s Mental Health Week programming. Additionally, when students do make a decision to take time off for mental health reasons, it is still inherently a difficult and scary process; there is a lot the administration could do to alleviate this, ranging from anything as small as giving students “going away” care packages to creating a specific staff position for providing compassion and encouraging support to students during their withdrawal process. The administration might still mishandle some individual cases; after all, they’re human. But if this were to happen, we could and should bring it to the surface, so they have a chance to take that feedback into account moving forward, just as they did with last year’s op-ed — because I do believe they care for us students, deep down. In closing, I am encouraged by Princeton’s compassionate responses so far, and while acknowledging that the journey to quality mental health policy is not over yet, I am confident that we can continue to make progress if we work together. My hope perseveres.|~|
85938|~|Expanding civic service|~|   May 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|In a previous opinion piece, a group of seniors shared how service and community engagement have been integral to our Princeton experiences. We defined meaningful service as building compassionate relationships with those around us. Deeply engaging with the world and our own communities — both through academics and extracurriculars — was immensely beneficial to our growth as individuals, and we are grateful for these defining experiences. Although those within our group have had significantly different experiences at Princeton, we all identify as “service-minded” students. To be sure, not all students for whom service is a fundamental part of their experience have found their outlet at the Pace Center. Even in light of this, it is a bit shocking that we had difficulty finding more than 30 seniors who were interested in writing about what it means to be service-minded. We believe that is a problem. Service should not be a form of identification for some. Ideally, we want to see community engagement become part of what it means to be a Princetonian. Within our university, students define themselves in a multitude of ways: some talent-based through sports or dance groups, and some identity-based like being a member of the Black Student Union or being active in LGBT life on campus. But no special talent or identity is required to be engaged in service, and there is no objective reason why service is not already closely tied with the very concept of being a student. We believe that community engagement is a core value, and it should be treated as such instead of as an extracurricular activity. Our University already stresses certain values: perseverance, hard work and intellectual curiosity. Most students leave Princeton having internalized these values. But the desire to serve becomes a reflex for only some, whereas we should all graduate having gained a new way of engaging with our world, using a lens of service and compassion to guide our actions. We should feel the need for service to be an intimate part of our lives after we leave here. The question is why does it not already happen? The problem lies both in our individual attitudes and in institutional constraints. There are ways in which both we as students and the University can move toward to embed civic engagement into our ethos and daily habits. First, it is important that all student groups begin to think of ways that they can incorporate service into their work. We applaud the efforts that have sprung up in recent years by clubs and athletic teams to incorporate service into their experiences. We encourage student leaders of all campus organizations to incorporate this type of engagement in their work. If all groups — from a cappella ensembles, to cultural organizations, to pre-professional networks — dedicated themselves to incorporating service into their mission, our campus culture would shift. We strongly believe that the best way to do so is through consistent, long-term service projects, rather than simple one-time engagements. In order for these initiatives to occur, the University could provide funding to incentivize students to emphasize service through extracurriculars and summer experiences. The Pace Center can provide technical support to non-Pace student groups, and ODUS can create a fund for clubs that commit themselves to engaging with the broader community. The Princeton Internships in Civic Service program should also be expanded, better advertised and not restricted to the organizations selected by the Pace Center. The University could strengthen its commitment to viewing service as a crucial mechanism of learning. If we truly believe in our motto, “in the service of the nation,” our institution should treat service as having the same educational value as a lecture course. To this end, Princeton could easily restructure its incentive system — along with the language it uses — to promote service learning. One example is the Community-Based Learning Initiative, which allows students to receive credit for academic work that supports a local organization. Though CBLI exists, few professors ask their students to engage in these projects. Again, incentives are key. If Princeton would reward both students (by giving end-of-year prizes for CBLI projects) and faculty (via financial or administrative benefits) for engaging in these projects, it would signal to the entire student body that engaged academic excellence is prioritized at this University. There is no shortage of good examples of ways in which Princeton could reimagine itself in order to live up to its unofficial motto. What is ultimately important is that the institution and the individuals within it recognize the centrality of service to our education. The University has a responsibility to explicitly communicate that it values community engagement beyond simply stating so at our matriculation and commencement. In order to develop service-minded students, we call on the University to make service and civic engagement central to our model of education.

85901|~|Editorial: USG Referendum Campaign Spending|~|   May 10 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|This academic year, Princeton’s undergraduate student body voted in a series of contentious referenda. While Undergraduate Student Government elections are governed by campaign finance regulations outlined in the USG Elections Handbook, students involved in referendum campaigns are only bound by Princeton’s “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities,” as well as New Jersey law. As a result, referenda become an electoral free-for-all during which student advocacy organizations have the ability to spend unlimited funds in support of their causes without listing their donors. This issue was brought to light after the recent referendum on divestment. During the period leading up to the election, several students noted increasingly expensive and sophisticated campaigning techniques such as targeted Facebook advertising. The Editorial Board calls on the Undergraduate Student Government to institute greater transparency in referendum campaigns by requiring student advocacy organizations that participate to report and publish their donors and total expenditures. The Board recognizes the impracticability of implementing USG election-style campaign finance restrictions for referenda. USG candidates are given an allowance of $50 that cannot be supplemented using outside funds, which ensures an even playing field. Such a solution would not be applicable to University referenda. Since there are often several groups defending and opposing a referendum topic, imposing a maximum expenditure per side would force USG to decide what organizations are officially supporting and opposing the referendum when allocating the allowance. We believe that this would unfairly silence other organizations that wish to be involved with the referendum and offer different perspectives. Since certain student organizations by their very nature advocate for issues often-related to the subjects of referenda year-round, a spending cap could prevent these organizations from conducting scheduled programming if such programing would cause them to surpass the spending limit. We do not want to prevent organizations such as the Princeton Committee on Palestine or Tigers For Israel from planning events that otherwise would have taken place. Rather than limiting spending, the Board believes that the best way to improve the referendum process is to increase transparency. Many referendum topics involve controversial issues, and outside advocacy groups may intervene by funding Princeton student advocacy organizations. The student body has an interest in knowing how much money goes into advocacy campaigns related to USG referenda, and from whom this money comes. The Board calls on USG to require all USG-recognized student organizations involved in referendum campaigns to list their donors and publish expenditures that expressly support one side of a referendum. This would let interested students know how much each side is spending, and where funds are coming from. Organizations would be required to report expenditures to the Chief Elections Manager. As under the current system for USG elections, individual students would be able to report suspected undeclared expenditures to the Chief Elections Manager for review. In USG elections, candidates are deducted points for campaign finance violations. The Board believes that the point system would be inadequate in the context of a referendum, as referenda are designed to measure popular opinion and it would be unfair to penalize an idea. Rather, the Board trusts that creating public accountability for campaign finance violations would be sufficient to deter rule breaking. This solution is not perfect, but it is a necessary step towards improving the referendum process. As with all campaign finance regulations, there are loopholes. The University cannot stop outside groups from placing advertisements in University publications, nor is it in a position to prevent expensive advocacy conducted in an individual capacity. That being said, the Board believes that this proposal will increase confidence in the referendum process through much-needed transparency without silencing discourse on campus.|~|Allison Berger ’18 and Paul Draper ’18 abstained from this editorial.

85951|~|Coming around the corner|~|   May 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|At the final Senior Pub Night, it became painfully clear that I do not know a large portion of the senior class and this seemed to be the consensus among many people I spoke with that night. Despite sharing four years on the same 500 acres — the same study spaces and dining spaces and workout spaces and social spaces — the senior class, as a whole, remains largely unfamiliar. The subset of the senior class that pushed their way towards the free beer and quickly disappearing French fries was full of — for lack of a better word — strangers. The realization seemed sad to me. I was standing in a room of people who had struggled through Princeton alongside me, had maybe watched the sun come up from the window of a study room after the same frantic all-nighter, had maybe walked a few steps behind or ahead of me after a night on the Street that wasn’t what we’d hoped, had maybe called home at the same time I called home just to talk to Mom or Dad because the day had been rough and we still hope that our parents might have all the answers. But my chance to meet these people had come and gone. I had fallen into a routine and these people had theirs and it just so happened that our routines did not quite line up. As a senior, everything is filtered through a nostalgic lens. So, it seemed sad to me that I was graduating without knowing more of these people, for they represented all the groups I hadn’t joined, the auditions I missed, the classes I did not take. I felt like I might be graduating with more missed opportunities — be it new friends or experiences or interests — than I had realized. But this column, my final column, is not about regret. It is too easy to look over these past four years and see all the things we should’ve, would’ve, could’ve done. And that is exactly what I did after the staff of Triumph politely kicked out the few stragglers and another “last” — in this case the “last” Pub Night — was checked off my long list of “lasts” as the year comes to a close. I thought I would write about taking every opportunity, trying to meet as many people as possible so that your Senior Pub Night is filled with friends and acquaintances — not strangers. But you’ve heard that, or some metaphor like it, before. It is no less true, of course. I’ll just throw it in here for good measure — do everything you can! But even if you fill every minute of every day with wonderful Princeton opportunities you’ll still find yourself with regrets. You’ll still have your “what if.” That is okay. It is the blessing and curse of Princeton students — high-achieving, hyper-aware, analytical — to always see how things could be better. But it takes a distinct effort to step back and acknowledge the things that have been so very good. So, yes, I did not know everyone at the Senior Pub Night, but I knew quite a few. One time, they too were strangers — just another person attending a free Broadway show freshman year, laughing at the same terrible joke in a precept my sophomore year, traveling abroad to the same university my junior year, attending the same Last Lecture my senior year. They represent the opportunities I did take and, when I look upon them, my regrets pale in comparison. So much of being happy, finding comfort in how the past four years were spent, comes from that shift in perspective. My glass is half-full these days. In fact, I’ve begun to see something exciting in the notion that even after four years in this rather small place you’ll never know everyone. W.B. Yeats wrote, “There are no strangers here; Only friends you haven’t met,” and I wish I had taken that to heart as a lost and somewhat jaded underclassman. There is always the possibility that someone you’ve never seen, not even once, will turn the corner and bump into you and change everything. It could be a friend or a significant other or even a professor who takes you under his wing and opens doors you could not have imagined. Any one of the people at Senior Pub Night could be my friend by Reunions — this year’s or next year’s or the one after that. Princeton is full of people you haven’t met and maybe it’s sad but maybe it’s wonderful and challenging and will always keep this place exciting and new. On the hard days at Princeton, when everything seems wrong and your Mom and Dad don’t have the answers, that is a comforting thought.|~|Chelsea Jones is an English major from Ridgefield, Conn.

85846|~|Expanding civic service|~|   May 7 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|As graduating seniors, we have been repeatedly told the University’s unofficial motto over four years: “In the Nation’s Service and in the Service of All Nations.” Before we walk through the FitzRandolph Gate, we wanted to reflect on why service is such a valuable part of a University education. This column aims to highlight the importance of civic engagement in the lives of participating students. While the point of service and civic engagement is to serve others, there are invaluable benefits for participants themselves. We seek to disrupt the notion that service is about the privileged helping the poor, a one-way flow of resources from the University to the community. Instead, we argue that the most meaningful service is built on honest, compassionate relationships with those around us. These relationships, above all else, have sustained us and driven us in our individual attempts to positively affect our communities. Service and civic engagement can begin in one’s own backyard through showing compassion to those in our own circles. Damaris Miller ’15 noted, “In the drive to ‘go do service’ we can forget that there are people living with us on campus who are in need and often marginalized in some way.” Miller credits her Bridge Year experience with this perspective, reflecting that during her year in India, she began to feel that “the richest service I could do began with friendship and have striven to maintain that notion throughout Princeton, whether by serving communities off campus or seeking to aid those directly around me.”  Zhan Okuda-Lim ’15 similarly looked inwardly to find his niche. Okuda-Lim has spearheaded mental health policy reform on campus as a result of his own experiences with mental health issues. Upon hearing that other students also had similar difficulties navigating health resources on campus, he worked with students and administrators to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health on campus and to expand access to campus resources. For others, service or civic engagement outside of one’s community is pivotal because it provides individuals with a more accurate sense of reality. For Logan Coleman ’15, serving as an active participant of DREAM Team, an immigration reform group with the Pace Center for Civic Engagement, has kept her grounded. Coleman says, “The perspectives that we gain access to through opening up our doors to the community have been pivotal in expanding and clarifying our vision of reality that can otherwise become overly isolated within Princeton’s gates.” Coleman highlights a powerful experience in which DREAM team helped stop the deportation of a New Jersey father. Logan says, “Seeing him reunite with his family in time for Thanksgiving will continue to live in my memory as one of the happiest moments of my life and would have never been possible without the two-way street of engagement.” Service and civic engagement also provide depth to one’s life by supplementing volunteers’ understanding of issues with real, lived experiences of those who are directly affected by them. Claire Nuchtern ’15 sees the inextricable link between service and her University education. By taking classes in African American Studies and sociology, Nuchtern was able to gain a critical lens through which to view her volunteer activities at a local prison. Noting one of her reasons for continued involvement in service, Nuchtern says, “I fear I would have forgotten the stories and hopes and dreams behind the horrifying statistics.” For students with intense academic or extracurricular commitments, it can be a challenge to fit service into their schedule. However, for varsity athlete Joanna Anyanwu ’15, experiences with diverse communities through civic engagement informed her interactions with her teammates and friends. Anyanwu says, “It was paramount that I integrate community service into my Princeton experience despite the constraints posed by my athletic commitments.” To this end, Anyanwu became an active leader in Community Action, which allowed her the opportunity to apply the skills she had learned on the track to expanding and enhancing the program. Anyanwu’s experience highlights how service has the ability to enhance all aspects of a student’s Princeton experience, rather than being a simple activity on the side. Our collective experiences highlight the depth to which community engagement experiences have affected us. The University is a place of tremendous resources and incredibly passionate people who are here to learn and grow. We found that through engaging meaningfully with our own community here, and with communities outside Princeton, we have been challenged to make service not a box to check, but an integral part of our world view. We hope to draw upon our varied experiences to reexamine what it means to serve at the University. We hope to redefine how this campus views this most crucial work and to challenge our community to reimagine service and civic engagement as not just an extracurricular activity, but as a broader system of ethics and way of engaging with the world that is at the heart of what it means to be a student at the University.

85838|~|Prisoners of Princeton|~|   May 7 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|In “The Shawshank Redemption,” Morgan Freeman talks about the effects of long-term incarceration on prison inmates: “These walls are funny. First you hate ’em, then you get used to ’em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That’s institutionalized.” The quote could not have been more apt if it had been expressly written about my Princeton experience: just replace the “funny walls” with the FitzRandolph Gate. I loathed those gates and everything they stood for during the first half of freshman year, deliberately walking through them two or three times in symbolic defiance against the culture, expectations and traditions that had begun to weave a sticky orange web around me. It’s hard for senior me to understand just how much freshman me hated the University, but I will always regard the social atmosphere of that year as my own personal version of Sartrean hell. At some point in the middle of my first year, I was “used to” Princeton to the extent that I stopped mentioning transfer applications every time I called home. By May, I reluctantly admitted to myself that I was growing fond of this place. I wrote a column in which I compared the University to a cult and proudly announced that I did not intend to join. I would remain gracefully and gratefully on the sidelines, appreciating all the University offered without doing the weird chest salute gesture at the end of our Old Nassau theme song. An anonymous upperclassman left me an ominous message in the comments section: “Just you wait, freshman.” The Morgan Freeman quote came up recently when I was explaining to a friend why I couldn’t wait to leave Princeton. I genuinely love the University and everything it has given me: friends, ideas, trips to exotic locales and free laundry. But I am ready to leave. I have been ready to leave for weeks. I am ready to leave because of all the ways in which the University is like a prison. A magnificent, gilded prison that swallows you alive as a freshman and spits you out again after serving a four-year sentence. You will walk out of the gates with the University’s particular brand of fleur-de-lis etched so deeply into your psyche that you will carry this awareness of yourself as a Princetonian around like an ethnic identity for the rest of your life. You even have several orange uniforms pieced together from countless free clothing giveaways to point to as relics of your incarceration. The University is a place where students can successfully convince themselves that they are having the best four years of their life while they pull all-nighters on essays, scramble to flesh out their summers with résumé-worthy experiences and cancel friend date after friend date because a social life is the one aspect of Princeton that is easily rescheduled. The academic demands are unrealistic (how much of the required reading did you actually complete this semester?) and the extracurriculars are often more stressful than the coursework. There will inevitably be multiple emotional breakdowns along the way but, if the mental pressure gets too high, you had best hide all that anxiety — the University doesn’t tolerate severe depression. And yet, like Shawshank, at the end of this harrowing, hammering experience, many of the inmates desire nothing more than to cower within these Gothic buildings for another four years, protected by the womb-like amenities and familiar though often brutally demanding campus culture from the uncertainty of everything beyond the gates. I wish I had the email address of the upperclassman who commented on my freshman year farewell column. I wish I could tell her that I still don’t do the Old Nassau salute, but that she may have been right about everything else. Because, like I said above, I am in love with Princeton. I love the challenging grind of an impossible amount of coursework, the sharpness of my friendships, the breathless race to keep abreast of too many extracurricular commitments. And most of all, I love the person I have turned into (or was it Princeton doing the turning?) over the past four years. At Princeton, I know who I am. Outside, I have to remake myself. And that is terrifying. I want to leave the University the way most Shawshank prisoners want to leave prison: The desire is strictly theoretical. I’m not sure how institutionalized I have become, but I am about to find out. And to all the underclassmen reading this, especially those who cannot wait to walk out the FitzRandolph Gate and free themselves in every way from the powerful, complicated, wonderful and arduous burden that is the University, I say: Just you wait.|~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio.

85842|~|Editorial: Redistribute commencement tickets|~|   May 7 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Commencement marks the end of of the undergraduate careers of Princeton seniors and includes four days of events for the members of the graduating class and their families. This is a time for great celebration that is meant to be shared with friends and relatives; however, given the differing capacities of the events’ various venues, seniors are given limited numbers of tickets for invitees. The number of allotted tickets is the same for all seniors, and those who want more are not allowed to buy them. The Board believes that the University should create a formal system for commencement ticket redistribution. The University currently distributes tickets for the four largest events. Every graduating senior receives three tickets for Baccalaureate, four for the Class Day ceremony, six for Prom and five for Commencement. This allowance of tickets is more than enough for some students, but not nearly enough for others. Students with smaller families or perhaps those whose families live abroad might not use all of their tickets, but some students with large families or many nearby relatives will not have enough for everybody. While this imbalance could be addressed by a market, the Board believes an alternative mechanism is preferable. Such a mechanism should honor the University’s ban on ticket sales because a market policy would unfairly preference wealthier students. A market system would also create an inapproriate monetary incentive to not bring guests to commencement. Still, the absence of a formal redistribution system means that some people have extra tickets and some people want more tickets. It is possible to plead with other students in order to find unused tickets, and friends certainly help each other when someone needs a ticket or has a leftover. Nonetheless, a student’s ability to bring additional guests to commencement should not be entirely determined by the size of his or her social network; the size of a student’s social network is as arbitrary as his or her wealth. As good as friendship and word-of-mouth are, a central system through which students could submit their extra tickets and apply for additional tickets would be far more equitable. We propose a modest buyback system that would allow the University to redistribute extra tickets. Under such a system, students with unused tickets could give them back to the University in return for a $10 credit. The small amount would encourage people to submit their extra tickets, but the fixed price would not force students to choose between bringing an additional guest and making a large profit. This buyback would help the University gain possession of the surplus; therefore, it could re-distribute additional tickets to students who apply for them. Through a lottery, students could indicate the number of additional  tickets they want and would receive additional tickets. Such a system would not destroy the private exchange between friends; rather, it would provide a more efficient process for the allocation of extra tickets. By instituting a buyback mechanism and a lottery process for interested students, this formal system of commencement ticket redistribution would best accommodate the guests of as many students as possible. Students only graduate from Princeton once, and the opportunity for family and friends to recognize this milestone is extremely valuable. The Board believes that, by implementing this system, the University would more efficiently and fairly grant this chance to as graduates many as possible.

85703|~|Searching for meaning in the rubble|~|   May 5 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|by Pujan Rai On April 25, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake shook the tiny nation of Nepal, killing over 7,000 people and destroying precious cultural heritage sites. Even Mount Everest trembled as entire villages were flattened. As a Nepalese student, I am personally struggling to find an objective meaning behind this tragedy. The only objective truth about this disaster that I know is that moving tectonic plates caused the earthquake. Despite the lack of an objective meaning to this disaster, I think we can apply subjective meanings to it, drawing humble lessons. First, it is clear that the Nepalese government should implement stricter building regulations and Nepalese people should be encouraged to build safer houses. The majority of earthquake-related deaths are due to building collapse and Nepal was no exception. Moreover, given the fact that Nepal lies in a seismically unstable region, the country should always be prepared for a disaster like this. However, we can also draw lessons from Nepal as a country; the Nepalese can choose to rally around this national tragedy to foster unity that has become a rare commodity in recent times. In the aftermath of a civil war from 1996 to 2006 and repeated failures to draft a timely constitution, the people of Nepal have become increasingly divided over ethno-linguistic, regional and political differences. This earthquake has stricken the Nepalese regardless of their identity, caste, color, region and religion. This hour of common sorrow calls the Nepalese to be united as a nation. As Nepal looks forward to a slow and painful recovery, a united reconstruction, not division, should be the spirit of the nation. Inspiring news is emerging from the chaos. There are stories of the Nepalese helping each other under duress when their government failed to respond promptly. Nepal’s South Asian neighbors, who themselves are poor and prone to natural disasters, have been quick and generous to send aid to Nepal. In particular, India wasted no time in sending airplanes with relief material. In addition, the international community has been quick to help the hapless Nepalese government mount a relief operation. My former host family in Norway immediately contacted me to check that my family was okay and informed me that Norway was sending 30 million Norwegian kroners as relief aid to Nepal. A Norwegian rescue dog named Gere helped save the life of a woman trapped under the rubble for five days. Besides governments, companies like Coca Cola, Pepsi, Microsoft and Toyota have contributed to the relief fund. Google revived its Person Finder tool designed to post information about missing people in the disaster zone. Facebook launched a Safety Check tool that allowed people to let their family and friends know that they were safe amidst the chaos. Solidarity with Nepal was demonstrated even in the soccer field; Real Madrid Football Club donned a special jersey calling its fans to be united for Nepal. Such humane and sympathetic reactions from the rest of the world make me think that in the absence of an absolute meaning of this disaster, perhaps we can assign our own meaning to it. Perhaps this tragedy has meaning in the opportunities it offers. There is an opportunity for the Nepalese to help their fellow countrymen. There is an opportunity for the South Asian nations to help a devastated neighbor. Most importantly, at an individual level, there is an opportunity for any person geographically insulated from the events to help reduce the suffering of fellow humans reeling from the wrath of nature. This disaster has exposed the fragility and vulnerability of human life in a poor nation. However, this hour can also be transformed into an opportunity to demonstrate human compassion, resilience and unity. With this spirit, Princeton students, the Pace Center for Civic Engagement, the Office of Religious Life and Princeton in Asia are organizing events in solidarity with the victims of the calamity. A vigil was held in Murray-Dodge Hall and we have launched a fundraising campaign to support organizations providing relief on the ground in Nepal. While we didn’t feel the earth shaking here in Princeton, it is our human responsibility to help. I invite all readers to meditate on this tragedy as an opportunity of shared humanity and to contribute to these campaigns in any way you can. Pujan Rai is an economics major from Bhojpur, Nepal.

85719|~|“Best interests of the University community” and sexual assault policies|~|   May 5 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|In the midst of formals and Lawnparties, I doubt many people have paid much attention to the round of changes to Princeton’s sexual assault policies the Council of the Princeton University Community finalized on Monday. These latest revisions primarily are in response to requested policy clarifications from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Education. Most of these changes are uncontroversial and quite beneficial to ensuring the fairness of the process. Under the changes explained in a cover letter to CPUC, students who face sexual and nonsexual charges related to the same incident — such as both an alleged sexual assault charge along with a property damage claim — would have to undergo only one joint judicial process instead of two. In addition, the definition of stalking is expanded to be more inclusive and accurate, by extending the policy to all complainants and not just those involving intimate partners. Most importantly perhaps, rather than forcing every complaint to be taken through the University’s judicial process, the OCR is permitting more flexibility and a variety of elements can now be considered. While some of these factors seem unquestionably an improvement, like the “complainant’s articulated concerns” for the University not to pursue an investigation, the vagueness of other listed aspects, such as the “best interests of the University community,” are quite concerning. According to the marked-up edits CPUC approved at Monday’s meeting, “OCR provides guidance indicating that we can balance the Complainant’s wishes along with other factors in determining whether to move forward with an investigation.” In response, the policy has thus been adjusted to permit the “complainant’s articulated concerns, the best interests of the University community, fair treatment of all individuals involved, and the University’s obligations under Title IX” to be considered in determining whether or not to move forward with an investigation and judgment. This list of criteria is spelled out three times in the new policy, in sections 1.9, 1.9.8, and 1.9.10. This new flexibility could erode the policy’s protections against the University simply making a determination short of a full investigation and judicial action that it is in the “University community’s” best interest not to pursue a case. Many factors could be considered in the University community’s best interest, and they often compete with what is in the best interest of the complainant. Justice to victims is best for the University community’s interests. Thus, going forward with investigating cases, so long as the complainant wishes to do so, is ideal. Hopefully the administration agrees that investigating reports of sexual assaults and convening a judicial review when found applicable are best for the community and thus would generally go forward with a case even under this new flexible criterion, unless there is some extenuating circumstance. However, the potential exists for this new flexibility to be abused. Nationally, there is a trend for colleges to underreport sexual assault. Presumably, these schools believe underreporting renders them more desirable, safer campuses, even though this could be simply a sign of ignoring the problem. According to Vice Provost for Institutional Equity and Diversity Michele Minter at Monday’s CPUC meeting, all cases would still undergo a basic investigation before this decision would be made and then these listed criteria would be considered when determining whether or not to move forward. While this statement is somewhat comforting, it still doesn’t change the potential arbitrariness the current wording permits. As Vice Provost Minter highlights, the flexibility provided by considering all these factors can do much good — such as allowing the University to pursue a case in the best interest of the overall safety of the community despite the complainant’s desire for no action, such as if there was some fear of a serial rapist, as studies show many college rapists are. But the possibility of good decisions under the new policy does not outweigh the opportunities for abuse. Simply spelling out in more explicit detail what the best interests of the University are in the actual policy can both help allow the positive outcomes and avoid possible missteps. So long as the decision to bring a judicial proceeding is going to be made in a closed-door setting, as it really must be due to privacy concerns, by people who are ultimately subjective like any other individual, the criteria for making this determination should be specified in writing. This will limit the potential subjectivity and provide more transparency to the entire process. The University community must really understand what information is being weighed when the decision is made to  move a case forward or not. Spelling out exactly what factors should be considered is challenging, and doing so inherently limits flexibility in a potentially harmful way. However, it is possible to draft a clearer, more exhaustive list than “best interests of the University community,” and the benefits of this transparency outweigh the potential downfalls of slightly restricted flexibility.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

85705|~|A more complete Princeton Preview|~|   May 5 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Nicholas Wu|~|   Contributor     |~|Seeing all of the newly admitted students walking around campus last week brought back a flood of memories for me. I really had a wonderful experience at Princeton Preview back in April 2014. Indeed, I made some of my best friends there. It seems like it was not long ago that I was one of those starry-eyed prefrosh too, clutching my orange-and-black drawstring bag as if it contained the Holy Grail. It was certainly amusing to take a step back as a Preview Host and an Activities Fair volunteer to see what we all looked like as prefrosh. I noticed that one person even posted in the Class of 2019 Facebook group to ask, “Who else kept their Princeton plastic water bottle(s) from preview and plans to reuse them indefinitely?” I could sympathize with that person’s sentiments. After the temporary stint inside the Orange Bubble that is Princeton Preview, items as simple as a plastic water bottle marked with the Princeton shield or an orange-and-black drawstring bag remained our only tangible connection to that mystical place known as Princeton when we returned to our homes in the real world. With the Princeton Preview program, the University is successfully able to present an ideal version of Princeton to the outside world; however, Preview also masks the less glamorous aspects of life on campus, particularly with regard to the state of mental health. A person who attended Preview would come away with the impression that Princeton was an amazing place all of the time, without a fault in the world (other than the inflation of prices of University apparel at the U-Store). The truth is that’s not the case, as evidenced by the number of initiatives on campus like the Princeton Perspective Project, Dear World and the numerous other mental health initiatives that aim to show that the campus is not entirely idyllic after all. I definitely expected to be challenged here academically, but I never expected to be confronted with mental health issues among my closest friends. Based on what I had seen at Preview, I had no inkling of the kinds of problems that lurked beneath the surface here at Princeton. The only image of Princeton that I had seen at Preview was the perfect one, with no forewarning of the potential travails to come. According to a 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, nearly half of all college-aged people suffered from at least one kind of psychiatric disorder in the past year, but less than half of those suffering from some disorder seek out any form of treatment for that disorder. In the context of our campus, that phenomenon is indicative of a larger problem about addressing mental health problems. The 2012 COMBO III survey showed that almost half of all female students on campus and 37 percent of male students felt that they were sometimes or often depressed. There are programs on campus that are working towards establishing a safer, healthier campus for everyone like the Undergraduate Student Government Princeton Mental Health Initiative, but Preview remains one of the parts of the campus experience untouched by these. The campus’s mental health problems should be made transparent to the visiting prefrosh so that they can see that these problems exist and that there are the resources available to help them in the event that they are afflicted by these issues as students. This is not to say that Preview should become a gloomy time; on the contrary, it should still maintain its celebratory air — it should still attract students to come here, after all. Instead, it should change to reflect a more accurate picture of Princeton as a place that is at once “the best damn place of all” and yet not a perfect wonderland. One way to improve awareness of these issues would be the publicizing of different mental health resources for students here on campus during Preview. An expanded Counseling and Psychological Services or Mental Health Initiative presence at the Preview Activities Fair might be a way of accomplishing that goal. Not only would those provide a more complete picture of life here on Princeton, but also from the view of a prospective student, those facilities are attractive insofar as they show the amount of help and care that the University could provide for its students. The University has repeatedly affirmed its dedication to mental health initiatives on campus — Preview can serve as a part of that effort as well.|~|Nicholas Wu is a freshman from Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich.

85491|~|Room Swap Period after Draw Time|~|   May 3 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|My three future roommates and I had obsessively checked room reviews, floor plans and the kinds of rooms people got with our draw time last year. We clicked on the little hearts next to the room numbers that we liked and jotted our top choices (the quads with four singles known as Quingles, located in Bloomberg Hall for Butlerites). We were lucky enough to get the exact room we had wanted. But when my group chats with different friend groups started buzzing uncontrollably, I found that while some of my friends had been triumphant, many had not. While some did not get the type or size of the room they wanted, others had been separated from their friends. It seems like there could be ways to improve the status quo. Currently, individual students need to request room improvements and switches after their draw has already taken place. The Princeton Housing & Real Estate Services says with regards to room improvement, “juniors and seniors, who participated in Upperclass Room Draw and had draw times in the bottom quarter of their class, may upgrade or “improve” their room selection. If you satisfy both of these conditions, you are eligible for reassignment to a room that becomes available after room draw and before July 1.” With regards to switching rooms, students are able to write requesting a room switch as long as they meet the following three criteria: one, “you may only switch rooms that were drawn with the same application weight”; two, “you may switch roommates within a group, but the integrity of the group must remain intact. For example, a mixed class group must have an older member in the suite”; three, “students who plan to cancel their contracts may not switch rooms.” I suggest a room swap period after draw time, during which students can view the rooms that every student received publicly and request swaps with other students. This would be especially useful for room switches. There are many reasons why students would be interested in doing this. For one, a main criticism of draw group is that because it sets a maximum cap for the number of students in each draw group, it can split friend groups and leave one or two people away from their friends. For example, my friends wanted to live next to each other but could not. One of them would have been perfectly willing to live in a smaller room just so that he could have that proximity to the adjacent rooms. If there was a swap period, he could easily approach the student scheduled to live in the adjacent room, who might have liked the idea of getting a bigger room. Furthermore, students can change their minds after drawing due to shifts in friendship dynamics or living preferences. A room swap period would make it easier for students to adjust accordingly. The only restriction to the room swap should be that it must take place within the student’s home residential college. In the room swap period, changes would be made with the consent of all parties involved in the swap. Therefore, the rules like “you have to maintain the integrity of a group” or “you may only switch with rooms that were drawn with the same application weight” would be irrelevant. If anything, these rules would hinder the student attempt to find the best living accommodation. Princeton room draw believes in the fairness coming from power of randomness. I, too, believe that the current system maximizes fairness. However, I do not believe that it is the most efficient. A small change like the addition of a room swap period could streamline the process significantly.|~|
85498|~|Editorial: Treat sex seriously|~|   May 3 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Princeton Preview has come and gone, and the University is preparing to welcome the Class of 2019 in September. For incoming freshmen, orientation week is a turbulent transition into a new social scene, and residential college advisers serve as guides to University policy and culture, including sexuality on campus. Next fall, RCAs will distribute a copy of “You’re So Sexy When You Aren’t Transmitting STDs,” a comic book meant to provide freshmen with information about consent and safe sex. Additionally, all freshmen will watch the play “The Way You Move,” which addresses campus sexual climate. While presenting this material engagingly is commendable, the University fails to treat the subject matter with the gravity it deserves and to include those who choose abstinence. Sexual well-being is no joking matter. Sure, people have different views about sex, but a hand-drawn comic book with frivolous characters like “Dick McClean” and “Captain Buzzkill” — not to mention a cover adorned with penises growing on vines — is simply no way to discuss weighty matters like STDs or the psychological effects of sexual intimacy. During freshman week, the University treats other serious subjects — such as academic integrity, alcohol use, mental health and eating disorders — with due sensitivity, respect and gravity. Why not sex? Scrap the tasteless cartoons. A more concise but engaging booklet with simple, medically accurate diagrams would provide all the necessary information in a more dignified manner. A second problem with the comic book is its complete neglect to mention abstinence, let alone offer any strategies for maintaining abstinence if students so choose. Though the book explicitly addresses those who “have had sex, are having sex, or plan to have sex,” the fact that the book — with a condom taped to it — is mandatory handout material sends a message biased toward facilitating or even encouraging sexual activity. This fails to convey the full range of attitudes toward sex on campus and excludes students committed to or considering abstinence — whether for health reasons, moral reasons or both. Leaving off the gratuitous condom and including a section devoted to abstinence would remedy the problem. Besides the comic book, the mandatory orientation week play could also be improved. Currently titled “The Way You Move,” the play has been edited to focus increasingly on sexual assault in recent years; in last year’s revision of the play, however, the openly abstinent character was eliminated. Increased discussion of sexual assault in the play is valuable, but it does not require the removal of a character whose message is supportive toward a significant portion of the student body. Restoring this character would reduce the likelihood of alienating abstinent students, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will be receptive to other key messages in the play. Besides simply being more welcoming, both the play and the comic book could steer students who are considering abstinence toward resources like Counseling and Psychological Services, the Office of Religious Life or Peer Health Advising. Since all freshmen are to receive the informational materials and to attend the play, the University should attend to the various needs of the incoming class, not just those planning to be sexually active. Treating sex seriously and incorporating abstinence into the freshman week curriculum that the University is now preparing would create a better, more inclusive environment for the incoming Tigers of 2019. Cydney Kim ‘17, Kevin Wong ‘17, and Andrew Tsukamoto ‘15 abstained from the writing of this editorial. Dissent We disagree for three reasons: (1) the objective of sex education is to educate incoming freshmen about sexual health and safety; (2) the programming employed by the University only needs to promote this objective; and (3) given the role of the University, distributing condoms to incoming freshmen is appropriate. Furthermore, we find the arguments made by the majority to be riddled with moral bias and to be devoid of objectivity. The University offers educational programming about sexual safety and health to promote communal health and well-being. Abstinence is not a matter of sexual health; rather, it is a matter of personal choice and morality. Since the relevant University interest is health, it would be unnecessary for the University to distribute materials related to morality. Condoms are a mechanism to promote sexual health; they facilitate and encourage safe sex on a campus where many students are sexually active. We recognize that the University must provide programming that is both informative and engaging. We agree that it would be imprudent to create comics about certain campus issues; however, we believe the comic book to which the majority has referred strikes the balance well. The majority fails to offer any reason beyond morality for always presenting sex education in stark medical terms. Would a sheet of statistics distributed in September spur this sort of discussion? We think not. For these reasons, we respectfully dissent.

85505|~|An Alternative to Big Sean|~|   May 2 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|About three weeks ago, I co-organized a petition concerning Big Sean’s planned performance at this year’s Lawnparties. The primary aim was to ask the Undergraduate Student Government to rescind its invitation to Big Sean and replace his performance with one from an equally well-known artist. However, this was not the only goal: I also wanted to raise awareness about lyrics and actions that reflect and reinforce a broader culture of misogyny and homophobia. For those unfamiliar with Big Sean’s criminal history, it includes being arrested and charged with sex abuse in the third degree and forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment in the second degree of a female minor on August 4, 2011. The rapper and Willie Antonio “Sayitainttone” Hansbro pled guilty to a lesser crime: unlawful imprisonment. No less disturbing are Big Sean’s violently misogynistic and homophobic lyrics. As a member of the Faculty-Student Committee on Sexual Misconduct, I was particularly shocked that USG thought it was appropriate to announce Big Sean’s performance with a video highlighting lyrics such as “You little stupid ass bitch, I ain’t fuckin’ with you/You little, you little dumb ass bitch, I ain’t fuckin’ with you … Little stupid ass, I don’t give a fuck, I don’t give a fuck” during the time in which University students were taking the “We Speak” sexual misconduct climate survey. The Office for Civil Rights mandated the University to administer a climate survey it was found to be violating Title IX. The University, like over 50 other universities, has broken federal law by failing to treat the victims of sexual assault with the dignity and equity that they deserve. That our student government was bringing a singer with a history of sexual assault to campus and paying him with student tuition money while the student body was taking the “We Speak” survey was ironic and upsetting. Our initial attempts to voice our concerns were disheartening as well. University students dismissed Big Sean’s criminal past and reflexively questioned the women whom he was charged with sexually assaulting. Although studies such as the one by Kelly, Lovett & Reagan (2005), show that only a tiny proportion of sexual assault reports are fabricated (see “False Reports: Moving Beyond the Issue to Successfully Investigate and Prosecute Non-Stranger Sexual Assaults” for an in-depth analysis on false reporting), some students on this campus automatically questioned whether the alleged victim tried to “frame” Big Sean and whether she lied about being assaulted because she was embarrassed after having consensual sex or sexual contact with him and/or Willie Antonio “Sayitainttone” Hansbro or because she wanted to gain attention. Unfortunately, this is an all too common and misogynistic narrative about women — they are liars out to get men. This pernicious myth silences victims of assault, leaving them to suffer alone, and exposes others to attack by the unchecked serial offender (studies find that rapists on average have 5.8 victims). Ending the typical practice of assuming an accusation of sexual assault is a lie is one step each of us can take. For those who doubt whether a performance by Big Sean would have a deleterious effect on campus, consider the impact that merely inviting him has had. Numerous survivors of sexual violence have approached organizers and me, expressing how “uncomfortable” they were with USG’s invitation. One peer discussed how the lyrics and Big Sean’s criminal background triggered memories of her sexual assault. Daily Princetonian columnist Tehila Wenger wrote that the invitation to Big Sean made her remember when she had been sexually harassed on a pier and triggered memories “of a high school girl [she] know[s] who deals with severe psychological trauma because her neighbor attacked her.” Since voicing our concerns, Duncan Hosie ’16 and I have both been subjected to repeated personal attacks and a strong backlash. Hosie has been called a “fag” or “faggot” and University students wrote on Yik Yak that they wished he would contract AIDS. I was called a “ho” on the Google Doc petition to show support against Big Sean’s performance. On Twitter, people tweeted me to say that I need “black dick.” One person wrote on the Google Doc that “women deserve rape, every year.” Duncan has been ridiculed and wished ill for his identity as a human being, and I was reduced to a sexual object. Some of the most passionate disagreement with the petition has come from students who feel that concerns about misogyny, on campus and in larger American discourse, unfairly target black men. As a minority from the Mexican border, I am sympathetic to these concerns. It is undeniable that African-American men are disproportionately maligned within the media and popular culture as violent rapists and abusers. This portrayal is how America has rationalized its violent treatment toward people of color in the past, from slavery to lynch mobs to Jim Crow. Furthermore, it remains a dominant way Americans currently rationalize the brutal treatment of African-Americans by the police. We are not arguing that Big Sean’s lyrics are unique, nor do we believe that hip hop as a genre is particularly problematic. We would object just as vehemently if USG had invited a white singer whose music similarly celebrated misogyny.  Furthermore, we think it must be acknowledged that much of the current music industry that produces this type of misogynistic music is composed of white men — not African-American men who are frequently associated with it. Big Sean’s performance perpetuates and affirms damaging stereotypes toward women and LGBT individuals and it will alienate survivors of sexual assault on our campus. It contradicts the University’s stated goals of empowering female students to participate actively in campus life. It rewards an individual who denies the humanity and dignity of others. Over the past couple of days, many students have asked us about the possibility of an alternative event for students to attend instead of the Big Sean concert. With the hard work of a diverse group of students and the generous financial and institutional support of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students, we are happy to announce that during the Big Sean performance there will be an alternative event at Campus Club. A live band, GoodMan Fiske, will be performing in the Campus Club backyard from 4:15-6 p.m., and there will be a barbecue. We hope that students will come to eat, enjoy the live music and sing along to popular hits that do not demean women or perpetuate homophobia. We hope that our fellow students will attend this event, standing in solidarity with survivors of sexual assault who have experienced feelings of alienation because of Big Sean’s impending performance.

85383|~|Open letter: abolish the box|~|   April 30 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|To University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 Dean of the College Valerie Smith Dean of Admission Janet Rapelye Provost David Lee GS ’99 Vice Provost for Institutional Equity and Diversity Michele Minter Executive Vice President Treby Williams ’84 Vice President for Campus Life Cynthia Cherrey Over the past three semesters, members of the University community have come together in support of a simple yet important step that the University can take to further its commitment to institutional equality and social justice. It has become widely acknowledged that the U.S. “justice” system is broken. Our nation’s overflowing jails and prisons are physical manifestations of the institutional racism and socioeconomic inequality that have plagued this country since its inception. Like other systems of social control, this system functions largely by stigmatizing and disenfranchising entire segments of the population. A person who has been labeled a “criminal” in our society, often as a result of the under-funding and over-policing of low income communities of color, can be systematically stripped of rights including housing, employment, voting and education. By asking prospective undergraduates about former involvement with this system in the application process (forcing them to check “the box”), the University actively supports racial and socioeconomic oppression, and consequently the decimation of communities, families and individual lives. In certain respects, the University has endorsed policies that address the penal reality. Its support for the Princeton Teaching Initiative and the Petey Greene Program, which bring high school and college-level courses into prisons, reflects an appreciation for the transformative power of education. The University does not require graduate school applicants to check the box, and as of this year, it delays such questions until the final stage of the hiring process. However, the University remains complicit in the dehumanizing process of criminalization through the factors it considers in its undergraduate admissions process. By receiving the information communicated by the box, it legitimizes a demonstrably unjust system. In order to end this form of discrimination, we call on the University to take a moral stand and refuse to accept information about an applicant’s history with the penal system in the admissions process. Despite the unquestionable flaws within our nation’s punishment system, the University and an estimated two-thirds of all universities fashion themselves into an arm of the punitive state by asking questions about past convictions on their applications. More than just facilitating an applicant’s rejection, this has a huge deterrent effect on people applying to colleges. A recent report done on the topic found that in the State University of New York system, for every applicant denied admission after checking “yes” when asked about past convictions, 15 other applicants who checked “yes” failed to complete the application form. Moreover, the median attrition rate for those with felony convictions was found to be three times higher than the median attrition rate for the general applicant pool. We are effectively dissuading or turning away an enormous block of potential applicants. Most University students can admit that they have committed “crimes,” like underage drinking, illegal drug use, minor driving infractions or maybe even more serious infractions. That we are here reflects the fact that we were never caught, or perhaps that we were fortunate enough to have legal representation capable of securing expungements or getting convictions overturned. Marginalized individuals from policed communities do not have these luxuries. What this means, practically, is that a question about past involvement with the punishment system asks more about applicants’ race, socioeconomic status or birthplace than about their moral standing. Inquiring about past convictions has never been proven to make campuses safer; universities that do not ask such questions do not report higher levels of violence or crime. We believe that the box represents a profound and harmful form of discrimination that the University should have nothing to do with. We do not accept that having been caught committing a crime disqualifies a person from having an education. While we believe that the University has both a moral imperative to remove questions about involvement with the penal system from its application process and the power to effect real change by doing so, we recognize that these questions must be addressed on a broader scale. For this reason, over the course of the past year, students at the University have been organizing alongside formerly incarcerated individuals, advocacy groups and students from over a dozen other institutions to form a national coalition to abolish the box. Given the recent attention to the inequities of the American penal system, the implementation of “ban the box” fair hiring practices in various jurisdictions (including New Jersey), and the rapidly expanding base of students and activists seeking to remove questions about past involvement with the penal system from college admissions, we believe that the success of this movement is imminent. Abolishing the box on the undergraduate application is an opportunity for the University to emerge as a leader in the fight for a more fair admission policy. This past year, over 600 University students, faculty and alumni have joined their voices to this call for more fair admissions. More recently, several campus advocacy groups have joined a coalition calling on the university to change. Among these are Students for Prison Education and Reform, Princeton College Democrats, Princeton Committee on Palestine, The Princeton Progressive, the Muslim Association for Social Justice and the Princeton Equality Project. In order to further educate the campus community about this issue and its intersections with other areas of social justice, members of the coalition will be hosting a teach-in during the coming week. We invite Eisgruber and other members of the University administration to join students, faculty and community members in attending this event in order to better understand the nature and broad range of support for this movement.

85385|~|Editorial: lengthen Princeton preview|~|   April 30 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Princeton Preview is the University’s premier outreach event for admitted students. Prior to the meningitis B outbreak that occurred a year and a half ago, Preview was a three-day event that included extensive exposure to student life and overnight stays in the University’s residential colleges. Last April, we agreed with the University’s decision to shorten Preview to a daylong program in response to the meningitis outbreak. However, given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now consider the University’s meningitis B risk equivalent to that of other colleges, the Editorial Board advocates that the University return to its overnight model for Preview. The current schedule packs Preview into an intensive, 12-hour span. Extending the schedule would allow for more campus organizations to present to admitted students while simultaneously affording them a respite between events. In addition, an overnight Preview affords campus organizations more variety in how they choose to market themselves to admitted students, including evening social events and performances. Consequently, the Board believes that extending Preview improves the quality as well as the variety of its events. Spending time at the University overnight for several days is also crucial to forming lasting bonds with other admitted students and current members of the University. Many current students express that people they met during Preview provided a supportive base of contacts and friends at the beginning of the year, when such support is most needed. Likewise, more time at Preview allows admitted students to form deeper connections with the campus and older students. Unfortunately, admitted students who do not live within driving distance from the University and do not qualify for financial aid may reasonably choose to not attend a mere 12-hour Preview. The Board believes that lengthening Preview would result in more of these students visiting the University, thereby expanding the geographic diversity of admitted students on campus during Preview weekends. Not every new student will take advantage of more time on campus, but affording the opportunity to admitted students is critical to enhancing their Preview experience and to allowing a full appreciation of the University. Those concerned about the logistical effort required to host an overnight stay might argue that, in spite of a shortened Preview, the University’s yield actually increased from 68.7 percent for the Class of 2017 to 69.2 percent for the Class of 2018. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions from this trend given that the data for this policy change only exists for one year. More salient is the long-term image of the University that a single-day Preview promotes: each of the seven other schools in the Ivy League offers some form of overnight stay for admitted students. The Board believes that Princeton Preview, in its current form, appears a mediocre gesture in the face of more concerted efforts from our peer institutions. This trend should also give our own admission office pause: there must be good reason that every other Ivy League institution has adopted an overnight policy. As such, the Board firmly believes that returning Preview to its overnight, three-day stay will improve the University’s image and enhance the experience of admitted students. The current Preview schedule is too short for new students to make the most of their time on campus.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its Chair, the Opinion Editor and the Editor-In-Chief. 
85387|~|Letter to the editor|~|   April 30 2015|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|To the Editor: As an alumna, I was extremely disappointed to read two recent guest columns (“Princeton’s Laboratory Animal Research Program,” published on April 22, and “Misleading and Factually Incorrect Coverage of Animal Research at the University,” April 28), which mislead readers through fear-mongering and a broad mischaracterization of the treatment of animals in laboratories. In addition, they misrepresent the supposed benefits of experiments on animals as well as public perceptions of animal testing. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, 50 percent of Americans oppose experiments on animals. And opposition rises the more the public learns about the constant pain and misery that animals endure in laboratories, the failure of animal experiments to provide accurate predictions of outcomes in humans and the availability of cutting-edge animal-free research methods. In recent tax-funded experiments at Princeton, experimenters injected oxytocin and hormones into the brains of rats and deliberately put them in stressful situations before finally killing and dissecting them. In another experiment, rats were videotaped having sex, injected with compounds to promote the growth of brain cells and then killed. In reality, these types of crude, cruel experiments — which cost millions of dollars and kill many animals — very rarely help people, as evidenced by the Food and Drug Administration’s finding that more than 90 percent of drugs that may have worked in animal tests subsequently fail in human clinical trials. Additionally, despite the misleading claims of the authors of these op-eds, federal inspectors have found that the University has allegedly violated federal animal-welfare laws. In recent years, the University has been cited for failing to provide justifications for the use of animals in harmful procedures, failure to provide monkeys with adequate veterinary care, and failure to provide appropriate oversight by University officials. Recent reports of the disturbing treatment of animals in campus laboratories are part of a system of institutionalized abuse at the University that should be roundly condemned by students, faculty, alumni and community members alike.

85211|~|Looking back|~|   April 29 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Yoni Benyamini It’s been a wild and often difficult year. Since September, we’ve complied with Title IX, defeated grade deflation and given the Wawa an impressive makeover. We followed Will Gansa ’17 through his presidential bid, investigated a sex photo controversy and motioned to Hose Bicker. We were arrested at Varsity Liquors, voiced our outrage at experimental percussion, debated misogyny and disputed divestment. It’s been an impassioned year in review, mounted upon a backdrop of gripping emotion. Overcome by moments of laughter and joy, of tears and incredible frustration. What of the year ahead? To the graduating seniors, congratulations. It’s been an absolute pleasure, and we’re eagerly awaiting your achievements beyond the bubble. You’ve inspired us, challenged us to think differently and added a new narrative to the fabric that is Princeton. Outside the white picket fences of leafy New Jersey awaits the beginning of an exciting new chapter. To the restless juniors, the sandwiched sophomores and the unassuming freshmen, become the most amazing version of yourselves. Build yourselves, and not your resumes. Focus on your relationships, be deliberate in your friendships and seek out intellectual satisfaction you won’t find anywhere else. Learn what emotions are, for despite the pain you might experience, you can experience greater pleasures. And don’t wait until after college to figure out what you eventually want out of life. Rather, immerse yourself in it and embrace the little things that make you smile throughout the stress. To the starry-eyed prefrosh, welcome to some of the best — and some of the most challenging, to say the least — years of your lives. The triumphs and tragedies that define you will inspire the cravings, creations and obsessions of your future classmates. You’ll be humbled by the virtuosos and connoisseurs down the hall, starstruck by the sheer athleticism of your roommates and awed by the assiduous dedication of your peers. If I can offer you any parting words of advice, don’t be afraid to quit. You have too little time to spend compromising. Do things that excite, inspire and fill you with the curiosity to transcend the ordinary. Don’t settle for anything less.|~|Yoni Benyamini is an ORFE major from Roslyn, New York.

85190|~|Are we there yet?|~|   April 29 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I can summarize campus politics in two words: Yik Yak. Yik Yak has become the primary platform for debate about issues facing our campus, since the app’s anonymity not only facilitates conversation and ardent debate but also personal attacks, as chronicled in several Buzzfeed articles over the “Urban Congo” controversy. But as heartening as it may be to see students tackling these issues on a variety of social media platforms, these issues must come out of Yik Yak and onto our actual campus and into our dialogue, hopefully without an abundance of ad hominem attacks. And they have, to some degree. We have made unfathomable progress with engendering debate on campus about the companies in which our university invests its money and the issue of divestment. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, the referendum piqued people’s interest in learning about arguments on both sides. In the process, it raised awareness for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a whole. These conversations occurred at dining halls, late meal and eating clubs across campus. The sole fact that these issues even entered our normal discourse indicates a shift in students’ attitudes. Moreover, on a macro level, we have realized the value and import ascribed to the introduction of referenda and petitions, even if one holds a view opposite to that proposed by the initiative. Voting numbers reflect this shift. The recent divestment referendum compelled 2,032 students to vote; 2,015 students casted votes on the winter break referendum; and 1,988 voted for or against the bicker referendum. But there are 5391 undergraduate students on this campus. That means only 38 percent of the undergraduate student body voted on the divestment referendum. We need to make our campus more political. I’m not talking about exhorting more people to be solely active or to take interest in domestic and international political issues or the party politics that unfortunately characterizes American politics today. I’m talking about exhorting people to take a greater interest in the government and public affairs of this campus and how certain issues affect the student body. A culture of apathy and close-mindedness governs our campus. Too often, students shrug off political issues that they perceive to not affect them in the “Orange Bubble,” such as Princeton’s current investment practices in correlation with sustainability and the Gaza conflict and sexual assault advocacy. We have yet to realize that this isn’t just about politics, but about how we are affected by these decisions. Of course, that would first require us to realize that we are affected by these decisions. Too often I hear a student say, “I don’t know enough about the issue to vote” or some variation thereof. Too often we cite an aversion toward politics or being politically involved as a reason to not engage in conversation and debate. Too often we choose to remain indifferent and yet proceed to demand change. None of the above should serve as an excuse to exonerate one from not voting. Both incognizance and apathy can be combated, what with undergraduate and graduate students tabling in Frist, hosting teach-ins and speakers, among an array of other opportunities to engage and be engaged. This sort of apathy governs many students’ outlook on Undergraduate Student Government as well. Many harbor negative sentiments and rush to entirely discredit USG as yet another futile bureaucratic institution that remains out-of-touch with the student body and our best interests. And yet, 12 out of 15 positions for class office were uncontested, with many incumbents sweeping the elections. Another facet of this issue that manifests itself in a general sense of apathy is actively choosing to abstain from voting because many of us simply do not care enough to click on a link, log in and cast a ballot. The numbers speak for themselves — 2200 students voted in the spring USG elections, which represents a voter turnout of 42 percent, less than half the student body. Compare this to a voter turnout of 2704 students in the winter USG elections, which yielded a turnout of 51 percent only a semester ago. This drop in turnout is disheartening. You may hate politics and politicians and everything that politics has come to stand for, but being politically involved is a separate matter. It remains paramount to participate in day-to-day conversations about issues that affect this campus. It is this sort of conversation that leads to tangible action, which ultimately stimulates change in one way or another. So I ask you to move away from whatever perception you may have of “campus politics” toward one that embraces it, in an effort to realize that what goes on outside this Bubble does actually affect us, each and every one of us.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

85223|~|The missing dimension: reflections on the divestment from Egypt|~|   April 29 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Reading through the divestment referendum that the undergraduates have already voted on and the graduate students are due to vote on in the course of this week, I was utterly shocked that Egypt was included in the referendum. Moreover, an article published a few weeks ago in The Daily Princetonian and written by supporters of this movement has provided a one-sided narrative about divestment from Egypt. As an Egyptian who was born, raised and lived there for 23 years, I feel compelled to provide another narrative to my fellow Princetonians. The fact that the article began by talking about the ousting of President Mohammed Morsi made me wonder about the relevance of this event to the goals of the divestment. What I recall from the relatively short period that Mohammed Morsi governed is his collaboration with and invitation of Hamas leaders to Cairo. It did not come as a surprise to me as Hamas has been established in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. Khaled Meshal, who is currently its chairman, is now residing in Qatar, a country that has been strongly supporting Hamas along with Saudi Arabia and Iran. It remains unclear to me and many other observers what Mohammed Morsi’s intentions were in collaborating with Hamas. Speaking of history, the 1978 Camp David Accords were a great success for Egypt and improved relations between the Egyptian and Israeli governments. Unfortunately, Egypt paid an extensive price for this peace treaty with Israel, culminating in the suspension of Egypt’s membership in the Arab League that was not lifted until 1989. Moreover, a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad assassinated President Anwar El Sadat on October 6, 1981, and the mother of the killer, Khaled Al-Islambouli, says she is still proud of her son, citing the Camp David Accords as a betrayal for the Islamic nation. Yusuf Sibai, who was the Egyptian minister of culture, was assassinated on February 18, 1978 by  the Abu Nidal Organization, a militant Palestinian group, because he supported and accompanied Anwar El Sadat during his historic visit to Jerusalem in 1977. In opposing the Camp David Accords, Islamist organizations in a variety of forms have worked hard to destabilize Egypt because the accords were seen as a betrayal for the Palestinian and Islamic cause, though Egypt has always been involved in mediating truces and negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. Since the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, the Sinai Peninsula has become a war zone between the Egyptian military and various terrorist organizations. The situation has worsened tremendously after the ousting of Mohammed Morsi in 2013. Concerning the Sinai Insurgency, out of the approximately 15 main militant groups operating in the Sinai desert, the most active militant groups have relations with the Gaza Strip. The Army of Islam, based in the Tzabra neighborhood of the Gaza Strip, is responsible for training many militant organizations and jihadist members in Sinai. The Army of Islam smuggles members into the Gaza Strip for training, then returns them to the Sinai Peninsula to engage in terrorist activities. This is just an example of the terrorist organizations operating in the border region between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. The most disturbing transformation in 2014 is that elements of Ansar Bait al-Maqdis (Supporters of the Holy House) group claimed allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and proclaimed themselves as the “Sinai Province,” and the grip of these terrorist organizations is only growing in the Sinai region. Moreover, offshoots of the Islamic State are spreading across Egypt and other countries in North Africa. Taking these events into account, it came to my surprise the superficiality and the simplicity of the rhetoric posed by the divestment campaigners that does not take into account the complexity of the Egyptian situation. The Princeton Divests Coalition prides itself for educating the campus about the Palestinian issue while the involvement of terrorist organizations in Egyptian-Palestinian relations has not been addressed. Can one implicitly speculate that the divestment campaigners assume that removing the Egyptian blockade on Gaza will ameliorate the lives of the Egyptians and Palestinians? I urge the divestment campaigners to be more explicit about this overlooked facet of the debate. Rather, it is naïve to think that lifting the blockade on Gaza will prompt the armed terrorist groups to give up their arms and beliefs in the total annihilation of Israel and in harming Egyptian interests. Though the evidence presented above may appear detailed and fragmented, this was done intentionally to show that, in an academic institution such as ours, it is highly important to contextualize any political move and to look at the ideological nuances that sometimes pass unnoticed. I do not claim that this is the whole story and I do not claim that the Egyptian government is clear of responsibilities, but I just wanted to bring to attention the missing dimension that the divestment campaigners have systematically avoided discussing or have tagged as irrelevant. Last but not least, political ideologies matter and one should be mindful of what values he or she is supporting without being affected by emotionally charged slogans and campaigns, especially as the graduate student body votes on this issue in the coming days.|~|Ahmed El Hady is a postdoctoral fellow in the Princeton Neuroscience Institute from Cairo, Egypt.

85076|~|Political Correctness in the Age of the Hipster|~|   April 28 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Imani Thornton|~|   Contributing Columnist      |~|Growing up, I was kindly told that there are three things you never discuss in polite company: religion, money and politics. I remember my parents telling me this at about age 12 in a matter-of-fact way and once again as a piece of advice before entering college. In the eight months since, I have mused over this piece of advice and, much to my parents’ potential disappointment, I find it difficult to follow. Admittedly, we live in the age of the modern hipster, many of whom consider themselves to be independent contrarians (whether or not they wish to be labeled “hipster”). We defy older generations, at least on social media, in much the same way the hippies of the late 1960s vocally defied their Silent Generation parents. However, since my time here, I have witnessed countless examples of this “hipster” culture falling flat. Unlike our parents, who likely grew up in the politically charged 60s and 70s, we avoid publicly discussing politics or religion at all costs. If Yik Yak’s response to the November campus protests are any indication, discussion of race outside Facebook posts and The Daily Princetonian articles is considered taboo. The few conversations I’ve had with my peers concerning their economic statuses have often been stilted and awkward. Yet, in ignoring these issues, we ignore the very factors that are determinants of how included we feel on campus. Perhaps these are simply strides to respect the privacy of others. And one should never be forced to talk about issues that make them uncomfortable. But, while considerate speech plays a major role in the way in which traditionally underrepresented groups feel included on campus, that should not become an excuse to avoid discussion about our own religious and political affiliations, as well as the way in which we think about race and economic background. When we do not discuss these topics, we allow them to fester. As uncomfortable as they are to discuss, these topics can inadvertently manifest themselves in harmful ways, usually in the form of false assumptions and stereotypes. In this “post-racial” and politically correct era, in lieu of offending, we often gain nothing from multiple and informed perspectives. In saying this, impertinence is not something for which I am advocating. “Hipster racism”, often characterized by ironic uses of derogatory names and cultural appropriation (as seen by Urban Congo), is the misguided way in which some navigate between political correctness and offense. Finding a line between political correctness and offensiveness is difficult but I think it is a challenge that we must not be afraid to face head on. Of course, this common call for action can become rather banal, so where are the solutions? We can first begin by being unafraid to ask questions. If someone has a genuine question about something, it is okay to ask it. Contrary to popular belief, it is permissible not to know something. Offense is often created when the offender (intentioned or not) assumes his or her offensive act is, in fact, acceptable. At the same time, we are not encyclopedias. While we are here to learn from each other just as we are here to learn from our books, we also have a responsibility to look for knowledge via books, magazine articles and other mediums. Friends and classmates do not owe anyone answers, and if they do happen to entertain questions, this is a luxury and not a right. In finding a solution, we must not place an educational burden on our peers. Finally, we must be willing to simply argue and discuss. It is difficult to change opinions, especially concerning such personal topics, but intellectual argument can be an informative experience and later taken and applied to other areas of discussion. Political correctness is only a burden if we hide behind the walls of our fear and misconceptions.|~|Imani Thornton is a freshman from Matteson, Ill. She can be contacted at it4@princeton.edu.

The 3-minute piece, produced by advocacy group The Make It Fair Project, rattles off statistic after statistic in an attempt to drive home the point that Hollywood is overwhelmingly male. The video’s main draw (and most likely the reason it’s gone viral over the past week or so) is the tone in which those facts are presented: it purports to highlight the “plight” of men in Hollywood, sarcasm dripping from every claim that only around nine-tenths of those in the limelight are male. The faux-uplifting, cutesy folk of the video’s chorus takes these statistics one step further to the absurd yet unfortunately almost inevitable conclusion many have drawn (whether seriously or, in this case, ironically) — that “it’s only fair that men should have it all.” At first glance, the reasonable reaction to this seems to be a response of, “Yes, and…?” I can’t help but find myself just a little bit annoyed by the surface-level stories on this video from sites like The Huffington Post and Jezebel, whose coverage pretty much amounts to agreeing wholeheartedly with the project’s message. Yes, of course men dominate Hollywood. We knew that in part because The New York Times, The Guardian, Buzzfeed, MSNBC and a whole slew of other news outlets have all covered that very topic in depth this past year. We knew that in part because of the related discussions on gender that this year’s #oscarssowhite movement spawned alongside the conversation on race. Put simply, it’s not saying anything particularly groundbreaking to agree with the content of this video, and it smacks of laziness to view this video as a content-repackaging opportunity above all else. However, what this superficial coverage fails to focus on is that the video actually accomplishes an important move in a new direction. Tucked into the end of the Jezebel story for three whole sentences, and not mentioned at all in the Huffington Post story, we find that the entire 70-plus-person cast behind this video — actors, writers, producers and everyone in between — was female. This, to me, seems huge. Not only is the #MAKEITFAIR video an indictment of the sexism of Hollywood, but it also takes tangible steps to combat that sexism. It’s one thing to complain about how terrible the misogynistic entertainment industry is, but it’s another thing altogether to actually create a concrete product that rallies around those without a powerful voice in that industry. I bring what I view as the video’s main accomplishment forward because I want to be able to highlight what it does exceptionally right, something I feel was lost in the coverage of other blogs. I want to say this because I unfortunately see this kind of focus on message-above-all corrupted in other sites’ treatments of really cool new projects. In my experience, there’s typically something lost in translation when high-traffic commentary sites cover incredibly important issues of oppression embedded deep in our society. At some point, their think pieces and denouncements lose their meaning simply because they stop saying new things. Eventually, these sites fall victim to “preaching to the choir”: their pieces have no impact simply because everyone reading them already agrees with what they’re saying. And while this notion is true on a scale much larger than issues of oppression — we see this writ large with the increasing polarization of our news sources and, by extension, the one-size-fits-all political views which instantly follow — it’s especially noticeable when it revolves around that topic because articles dealing with deeply held bigotry tend to push less and less into constructive territory, instead opting for a “shallow but hyper-timely” format which accomplishes nothing except a small financial gain for those publishing the piece. Many of these articles don’t seem to be written in order to push forward radical new thinking or new forms of persuasion but because of precisely the opposite: because the idea is agreeable and easily shareable, the content seems worth writing. However, in order to plow a new path through these issues, there’s a simple (if more time-intensive) solution: focus on not only what great new activism outlets are doing right, but also what they’re doing that’s new and exciting. In all this kerfuffle over how insightful or important the #MAKEITFAIR project is, we lose sight of what I think is the most important part of the video: it actually did something new. Its message is true, sure, but to me, it’s not so much about the message itself as it is about providing the appropriate vehicle for it. Lest we forget, it used its cultural power and production budget to actually create something out of the ordinary. It’s unfortunately uncommon to see anything like this project tread new ground, and as such we must celebrate the Make It Fair Project not only for what it said, but also for what it did.|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

85058|~|Misleading and factually incorrect coverage of animal research at the University|~|   April 28 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Laura Conour and Stuart Leland Two articles published recently in The Daily Princetonian contained factual inaccuracies and misleading information about research conducted with animals at the University. As the directors of two offices — Laboratory Animal Resources (LAR) and Research Integrity and Assurance (RIA) — that support the University’s research and educational programs, including laboratory animal research, we are writing to correct these errors. In an April 13 news article “U. accused of violating Animal Welfare Act in marmoset monkey incident,” contributing reporter Cassidy Tucker presented inaccuracies about two marmoset monkeys that escaped from their primary enclosures. In the incident, which occurred in December of 2014, two animals sustained injuries as a result of a fight between one of the escaped marmosets and another inside its primary enclosure. A veterinarian promptly treated the injured animals. The news article erroneously reported that an “outside firm retained by the University” investigated the incident. In fact, the University’s Office of Laboratory Animal Resources conducted the investigation. As a result, we changed several of our procedures, including modifying the current caging to more easily determine the security status of the doors, developing new procedures to facilitate transfer of marmosets to and from their home caging, training animal care staff and research personnel on these updates and identifying new caging for purchase. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), a committee comprised of University scientists and non-scientists as well as members of the public, was informed throughout. As required by policy, the University reported the incident to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), a regulatory compliance office under the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This is standard procedure for such incidents. By following applicable regulations and reporting significant incidents, the University works diligently and transparently with federal agencies to ensure animal welfare. The article also reported that Michael Budkie of Stop Animal Exploitation Now (SAEN), an animal activist organization, had filed a complaint with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). According to Tucker, the complaint sought penalties of $10,000 per infraction per animal. To investigate this we obtained a copy of the SAEN allegation to review the concern, which is available here: http://www.princeton.edu/ria/animal-research-protectio/documents/SAENLetter20150406. The complaint, which improperly refers to Princeton as Purdue and chooses to ignore the prompt corrective actions undertaken by the University as described above and in the OLAW documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by Budkie, does not seek fines against the University. The ‘Prince’ chose to publish the article before we had an opportunity to verify the facts with the USDA. Commenting on an unverified allegation would have been irresponsible, thus we chose not to provide a statement to the reporter at that time. Shortly thereafter, on April 20, Courtney Buoncore and Gwyndolyn Goldfeder, in a ‘Prince’ opinion article entitled “Opaque transparency: What we (don’t) know about Princeton’s animal experimentation,” published additional misleading statements regarding research with macaques. This piece implied that the research conducted using animals on campus was somehow hidden from the student body and lacked transparency. To illustrate the claim, the opinion piece focused on a study conducted by the laboratory of psychology professor Asif Ghazanfar. This research is in fact described both on Ghazanfar’s website and in full detail in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The relevant article, describing Ghazanfar’s research on speech production and face/voice integration, was published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) where it is freely available to the public: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3182859/. Buoncore’s and Goldfeder’s descriptions are inaccurate as reflected in the entirety of the PLoS paper. They stated that the heads of macaques were “cut open” and head posts were “stuck in.” As stated in Ghazanfar’s research article, these macaques had sterile surgery where a single head post was surgically implanted, following IACUC-approved protocols and procedures. Additionally, great time, care and attention were used to train these macaques using positive reinforcement to sit in restraint chairs and perform tasks.  The arms of the macaques were not restrained by Velcro and, in fact, these animals used their hands to depress levers in response to monkey avatar images of facial expressions and vocalizations and were rewarded with juice treats in a positive reinforcement paradigm. Buoncore and Goldfeder described the macaques staring “for hours at a screen” when in fact, the paper describes behavioral sessions “spanning durations of 25 to 50 minutes.” We encourage anyone interested in the topic to read the publication in its entirety for a complete and transparent description of the research and the scientific discoveries that resulted from the work. The University’s other research programs are no exception. They are typically described on a laboratory’s website so that students, faculty and others in the community can learn about the research. The knowledge that results from that research is published after rigorous anonymous peer review and is openly available to the scientific community and the public. At the University, laboratory-based research and teaching takes place with crayfish, frogs, golden shiners (fish), larval salamanders, macaques, marmosets, mice, rats and sea slugs. Of these species, 60 percent of the animals used in research at the University are fish and 38 percent are mice and rats.  Additionally, our students and faculty conduct field research around the globe with a focus on conservation of species and the impact of the environment on these species’ survival.  Students are active participants in these scientific endeavors through junior papers, senior theses and doctoral theses. All such projects involve animals only when there is no alternative way to gain the knowledge and understanding of the system or question under investigation. As directors, our priorities are the welfare of the animals and the integrity of the animal research program in which the University upholds and often exceeds the requirements set forth in regulations, policies and guidelines. Robust, quality research depends on animals that are healthy and free of undue stress. We serve in our roles at Princeton because the University invested resources in the animal research program, hiring professionals with expertise in the field of laboratory animal medicine to support the exceptional science that takes place here. We believe that openness in science is in the public interest and is essential to the process of scientific inquiry. This is especially true with highly regulated research, such as that involving animals, and this is why we feel it is important to provide accurate information in light of the inaccuracies included in the two recent ‘Prince’ articles.|~|Laura Conour (DVM, DACLAM) is an attending veterinarian at the University, and director of Laboratory Animal Resources.

84979|~|Bring Back TigerPAWW|~|   April 27 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Nicholas Wu|~|   Contributor     |~|Immortalized in everything from the Tiger Mag to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s This Side of Paradise, the Dinky is an important part of Princeton culture. I have fond memories of riding into Princeton on the Dinky when I first came as on a tour as a high school sophomore. Yet, like any other culture, Princeton’s culture must change with the times. Dinky service and the campus’s transportation links to the outside world can be made better. But that does not mean that the culture has to be destroyed. This past year, when the Dinky Station moved to its temporary location in a trailer, the introduction of the University’s TigerPaWW service showed us what a multimodal transit system could look like. I am a very strong believer in public transit, but I think that there is always room for improvement. Transit companies like the state-owned NJ Transit can be very efficient but they also can be extremely risk-averse. Any changes must go through layers of bureaucracy and review that are designed to protect the company’s shareholders, the people, but also inadvertently prevent it from doing anything truly innovative. TigerPaWW was a perfect example of the private sector (in this case the University) stepping in to fill the gaps in public service. Although the TigerPaWW bus ran concurrently with the Dinky, NJ Transit’s data showed that people overwhelmingly preferred to ride the bus over the Dinky. In fact, Dinky ridership dropped by an astounding 20 percent during the time period when the TigerPaWW bus was active. While a more superficial analysis might indicate that this decrease in Dinky ridership was due to the free nature of the buses, as opposed to the $2.75 ticket price of the Dinky, I think that the change was the result of the convenience and flexibility that the bus brought with it. The bus ran more frequently and at different times than the Dinky did, which gave travelers greater flexibility. The bus, moreover, was able to better serve the residents of the town of Princeton when the Dinky station was moved further downhill. The University originally introduced the TigerPaWW bus service because of the temporary disruptions to Dinky service. The lack of access to the dinky, vital to the community, caused much uproar. So much so that six lawsuits were filed against the University because of the moving of the Dinky. Groups like Save the Dinky sprouted up in an effort to reverse what they viewed as an attempt to remove Princeton’s sole rail link. The TigerPaWW bus was aimed at assuaging those concerns, as the bus’s College Road stop was closer to the original Dinky station. The new Dinky station has opened, but residents are still upset by the Arts and Transit Project. Clearly a better solution to the area’s transit problems is needed. One way to improve the current transit options at the Transit Plaza would be the introduction of a new bus service running between the Dinky Station and a location on Nassau Street, say Fitz-Randolph Gate or Palmer Square. While there have been some calls for the construction of a light rail line from the Dinky station to areas further up campus, it’s simply unfeasible given the cost of such a project and the size constraints imposed by the campus. A bus line, however, offers the access that a rail line extension would bring but at a lower cost. This new bus route would not only help downtown businesses, but also provide a public service for the residents of town by bridging the current gap in bus service between those locations. Right now, there are buses like the Campus Circulator and the West Extension Line that stop at Princeton Station, but they circulate throughout other stops, which limits their usefulness for residents of the town of Princeton by increasing the overall travel time. Another potential solution for the transit puzzle is Uber, which has quickly emerged as a competitor to not only the Dinky but also the local cab companies. An Uber ride from Princeton Station to Princeton Junction Station will cost roughly three times as much as a Dinky ticket, but that’s still significantly less than the amount charged by one of the black cabs. It can be easy to stereotype Uber as an unfair competitor in this transit market, but I welcome the rise of Uber. Uber has been a lifesaver for me many times when I either missed the Dinky through my own ineptitude at waking up on time or needed to catch a Princeton Junction train when the Dinky wasn’t running. Uber has found a corner of the market that they are able to exploit. Public transit is meant for the public good, and it should be accordingly well supported. However, the University, under both its contractual obligations as well as its role as a major player in Princeton, has an obligation to ensure good transit access. For the sake of convenience and improved town-gown relations, I hope that the University will advocate for some sort of better transit solution.|~|Nicholas Wu is a freshman from Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich.

84976|~|Why body image campaigns get it right (and have room to progress)|~|   April 27 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|On April 23, Colter Smith argued that body image campaigns have frequently erred in their attempts to promote a healthier environment insofar as they only target the conception that one’s body isn’t beautiful, rather than unhealthy attributions of self-worth. He makes some interesting points, but I think he largely misinterprets not only the intent of the “As I Am” campaign on campus, but also many of the motives behind other movements aimed at fostering a more positive body image. I agree that “we need to encourage students to focus on what causes them to ‘be’ great, rather than what makes them ‘look’ great.” Self-worth should never be derived from a singular thing, and instead should be assumed at a basic level and not based upon any arbitrary measurements. The issue here, however, is the mindset that Colter himself identifies in which self-worth is hinged largely upon appearance. In that case, it is not as simple as only finding other “loci of value” and celebrating that. This can and should happen; I would love to see a photo campaign in which students hold up signs answering the question “What do you believe makes you great?” In many cases, though, before students suffering from any sort of body image issues can proceed, they must break free of the box in which they are trapped. Inside this box, people may recognize that they are great or loved for characteristics independent of appearance, but there often exists a disconnect between that knowledge and one’s actual experiences. And so, for those struggling and for those struggling to understand, the focus can and should be upon celebrating bodies for what they are and honoring everyone’s unique experience. This is what I believe the “As I Am” campaign and body image campaigns in general seek to accomplish. In asking “What do you feel about your body and why?” it illuminates the pervasiveness of this issue and allows those suffering to honor the fact that there is no easy solution. It’s not as simple as expecting to relearn a basis of self-worth by distracting from a deeply-ingrained mentality. All of this attention does cast a high amount of attention on nutrition, exercise, and other matters pertaining to body image and eating disorders more specifically. Colter argues that this emphasis and attention “tell [him] that the people around [him] consider their appearance very important to them and that perhaps I should, too.” However, the “As I Am” campaign, by allowing that thought to cross the mind of someone who has apparently never had issues with body image, attempts to create a sense of empathy on campus while offering resources for those who might be suffering and already locked in such a detrimental cycle of intense focus on one’s body and food. I do believe, however, that campaigns in the future that seek to contribute to the conversation on body image on campus need to move past this general awareness and acceptance of experience; I don’t think, however, that a campaign fundamentally about body image can progress without speaking of the topic itself, as Colter seems to argue. Rather, the next in a line of questions posed to the student body can be “What does your body allow you to do?” By broaching the subject of a body’s beautiful capacity, internal dialogues can be shifted from the purely aesthetic value (which in itself is highly subjective) to the functional. And when one begins to think of all one’s body allows one to do, the natural progression can be towards what Colter urges — what does one’s mind allow one to do, and what can one do in general. There has to be a first link in this chain, however, and that is where I think body image campaigns get it right, but have room to grow.  |~|Kelly Hatfield is a sophomore from Medford, Mass.

84974|~|Congratulations, you have been admitted! Now what?|~|   April 27 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Matthew Choi Taitano|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The YouTube channel of Victoria Asbury, who goes by Victoria Shantrell on her channel, was an important part of my college application process. Her videos were inspirational to me because she talked about her being able to get accepted to Stanford, Princeton and other top schools despite the conditions in which she grew up. Coming from a financially unstable, single-parent household, as discussed in her personal essays, which she was brave enough to share on YouTube, Asbury had a life that many thought would lead her into a future of mediocrity. Despite these circumstances, however, her ambitions as a student allowed her to excel academically and to gain acceptances to these top-tier universities. Listening to Asbury’s story as a senior in high school who was applying to college, I was able to gather up the courage to put myself out there and to apply to some top schools in the United States as well. Had I not encountered her videos, I probably would not have even considered applying to some of the schools that I did. To many people who come from privileged backgrounds, applying to top schools may be a natural step. With family, friends and teachers believing in and expecting them to be accepted to these schools, these students are brought up in an environment that fosters this idea of academic excellence. However, students from underprivileged backgrounds, even if they are smart enough to be accepted, might still feel as though they are underqualified because they are made to believe that their socioeconomic status is a permanent boundary keeping them from a life of prosperity and success. I believe it is very important for those of us who are now attending these top schools despite our adverse backgrounds to continue to act as a reminder of the possibilities one can achieve despite these backgrounds. These reminders can be as bold as sharing our stories to the public as Asbury did, or as simple as keeping in touch with some students from our old high schools via social media. However we choose to do so, it is important for us to share our stories so that we could continue to inspire those who come from similar environments as we did. But the struggle does not automatically end the moment we are accepted. As discussed in another article I wrote, as well as an article published by the Boston Globe, low-income students continue to face struggles even when they are accepted to these top schools. As student Soraya Morales Nuñez ’18 so eloquently stated on her photo for the Princeton Hidden Minority Council photo campaign: “Just because I’m a first-generation, low-income student at Princeton doesn’t mean I don’t have problems at home anymore. The problems are still there — an acceptance letter doesn’t make them vanish. But I’m not running away from them. I’m preparing myself to confront them with a degree three years from now.” This quote encapsulates the struggles that come with being a low-income, first-generation student at a prestigious university. We, unlike many of our peers, do not have the luxury of being just a student. We also have to constantly worry about providing for our family back home. The issues that low-income, first-generation students face demonstrate the need for graduates from these universities who come from similar backgrounds to help guide these students. At schools like Princeton, it is so easy to feel as if you are not good enough, especially when we are surrounded by students who have had resources to prepare them for such rigor as they grew up. It is important to have people who have been through college to act as inspirations for us throughout our time here. That is why events such as those hosted by Vice President for Campus Life Cynthia Cherrey, in which students get to have dinners with faculty who came from low-income backgrounds, are essential to the life of these students. We need to be reminded that the underprivileged lives to which we are accustomed are not what we will experience forever. And I feel that I have an implicit obligation after graduation to continue to keep in mind those who still are enduring the struggles that I am currently facing now. I do not want to be that person who forgets where they come from and those who could benefit from my help. Nothing is more frustrating than learning that there are successful people who come from these underprivileged backgrounds who do nothing to contribute to communities similar to the ones in which they grew up. Something as simple as sharing how one transitions from poverty to success is extremely valuable and helps to inspire those who need help reminding themselves about their capabilities to succeed.|~|Matthew Choi Taitano is a freshman from Yigo, Guam.

84834|~|A plea for activism|~|   April 26 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Matt Beienburg Following recent events, the rightful outrage from our community — including the recent student demonstration in the University Chapel — appropriately galvanizes us to confront racial injustice and shame those who spew hate. That racism should be condemned could not be more true, and it is precisely what is true that we must always challenge ourselves to uphold. Despite the good intentions behind it, however, I fear the recent student demonstration has failed to do this, with significant, and troubling, implications. Understandably, many students considered the April 9th message from President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 a “tone-deaf” and tepid response to sickening bigotry, and they admirably raised their voices to say so. Yet amid the handful of signs carried into the chapel, one featured the president’s own words: “[Racism] is fundamental to the life of a great University” – Christopher L. Eisgruber. Such a heinous statement should never have been uttered by Princeton’s president. The problem, however, is that he never said it. Instead, he wrote: “Comedy, satire, and stage performances inevitably transgress boundaries. The controversies they provoke may be genuinely painful, but they are also fundamental to the life of any great University.” We might be inclined to shrug off the revision as hyperbole or an isolated error, or to concede that it’s close enough to what he implied. Or perhaps the sign simply satirized Eisgruber’s own support for “comedy, satire, and stage performances.” But there’s an enormous difference between a witty caricature and a misleading, false attribution. To ascribe a loathsome quotation to someone who has neither uttered nor remotely implied its content is, as The Daily Princetonian’s Editorial Board also observed, “intellectually dishonest.” This is more than quibbling over the proper rules of bracketed quotations. It’s about our alarming willingness to quite literally substitute the actual beliefs, intentions and words of our perceived political opponents with the worst of what we expect from them. Unfortunately, this urge extended beyond an isolated sign: the manifesto read aloud during the demonstration echoed the same indictment: “By proclaiming that racism is ‘fundamental to the life’ of Princeton University, this so-called community becomes one that violently excludes students of color.” There is certainly logic underlying the charge: if performance begets controversy, and controversy can mean racism, then isn’t defending the freedom to create controversy little better than defending racism? But take the same logic: The freedom to trust someone in friendship invites the risk of disappointment, heartache or betrayal. Yet friendship remains fundamental to the human experience, and it would be unthinkable to reinterpret such a phrase as “[betrayal] is fundamental to the human experience.” This does not lessen the students’ courage nor the credit they deserve for raising their voices. Those of us who do not and cannot ever fully know the pain affecting other members of our community, and who ourselves fail to engage proactively on their behalf, should hear the cries of abandonment and weariness. Why then, does this matter more broadly? First, activism, even for good causes, does not give license to distort the truth. If a cause is just, it should prevail because society awakens to the clarity of its truth, not because its advocates more shrewdly bend facts in the wars of rhetoric. Certainly misinformation has been used for great good — like shielding families from the Holocaust — but a habit or comfort with misrepresentation ultimately cripples our ability to perceive justice. Second, by speaking for, rather than to, those we disagree with, we shut down political dialogue. When warnings of “rising carbon levels” are heard by opponents as a conspiratorial plot for “economic totalitarianism,” or when calls to preserve local self-government become code for the bigotry of segregationist era states’ rights, we close the door to honest discussion. In such cases, should we not listen and discuss, rather than accuse? Third, racism is not a necessary evil. It is simply evil. Free speech, however, is precious, even though it can be used to do great harm. Students in the demonstration chanted “hate speech is not free speech,” and racist messages will never constitute a productive contribution to campus dialogue. But when even the words of the university’s president can be repackaged into something so odious, should we not consider the ramifications of attempting to arbitrate speech? As the ACLU reminds us, “Verbal purity is not social change. Codes that punish bigoted speech treat only the symptom: The problem itself is bigotry.” Yes, Princeton is a private institution within its right to decide when someone’s contribution to campus climate or dialogue is unwelcome. This isn’t about First Amendment protections. It is about, as Eisgruber quoted from the faculty resolution, “the University’s fundamental commitment … to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed.” Finally, let us look beyond our campus to the polarized politics in our country: If we condone the literal rewriting of others’ words amid our eagerness to find them illegitimate, how can we be trusted when advocating the greater truth of our side? Distortions and propaganda are unfortunate realities in politics, but that doesn’t mean we should deal in them ourselves. Lincoln’s words to aspiring jurists should apply no less to today’s political activists, left or right: “If in your own judgment you cannot be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a lawyer. Choose some other occupation, rather than one in the choosing of which you do, in advance, consent to be a knave.” Yes, let us stand up and reject the peddling of hate; let us promote the process of healing. But let us not separate truth from the pursuit of righteousness.|~|Matt Beienburg is a graduate student at the Woodrow Wilson School from Phoenix, AZ. He can be reached at mdb3@princeton.edu.   
84869|~|Editorial: Create a Hindu prayer space|~|   April 26 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Last week, The Daily Princetonian reported on an initiative by Princeton Hindu Satsangam and a number of both Hindu and non-Hindu students to advocate for the creation of a Hindu prayer space on campus. Though the University Chapel hosts Hindu events and Murray-Dodge Hall, which houses the University’s Religious Life offices, contains an interfaith prayer room, supporters of the proposal have pointed out that the establishment of a space geared specifically towards Hindu worship would offer a meaningful recognition of Princeton’s large Hindu community. Additionally, a new Hindu prayer space would contribute to the mission of fostering diversity and cultural awareness which lies at the core of the University’s educational goals. The Editorial Board endorses this initiative and commends the students who have expressed interest in a prayer space for their efforts to enhance Hindu life at Princeton. In general, the University does an excellent job of accommodating and assisting religious groups and of fostering an environment in which religiously-based student organizations can thrive; for example, Princeton supports regular services for Christians of all denominations in the Chapel, hosts the Center for Jewish Life (which sponsors meals, services and lectures), and offers a Muslim prayer room in Murray-Dodge Hall. In fact, according to Vineet Chander, Princeton’s Hindu life coordinator, Princeton maintains the nation’s only full-time Hindu life program. The designation of a Hindu prayer space would be a valuable contribution to the climate of religious and cultural diversity to which the University has demonstrated a strong commitment. Moreover, creating a Hindu prayer room would be more than a purely symbolic gesture; while the Chapel is not conducive to praying while seated on the floor, a new space could be arranged around specific Hindu traditions. The prayer room would give the Hindu community greater control over how it wishes to organize its services and would likely motivate Hindu Princetonians to deepen their involvement in Hindu life on campus. The creation of a Hindu prayer space could be completed without any inconvenience to the University community. There are many possible locations for the room; one recent suggestion is Green Hall, which is temporarily housing the Department of Astrophysical Sciences on its third floor. If the plan for a Hindu prayer space were to be accepted, the University should consult the Hindu community to find an available spot which would not only be convenient and easily repurposed, but which would meet the community’s wishes and needs. In addition to the relative simplicity of setting up a space, Princeton Hindu Satsangam’s proposal has wide support from both Hindu and non-Hindu, religious and non-religious students across the University. The Board sees no compelling reason not to go ahead with creating a Hindu prayer space, especially given the potential for the new space to benefit the Hindu community on campus and to strengthen the religious diversity from which all Princetonians can learn a great deal. The Hindu community is a valuable part of student life at Princeton, and the establishment of a Hindu prayer room would be an important step towards giving the Hindu community even greater recognition for its contributions to the University.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its Chair, the Opinion Editor and the Editor-In-Chief.

I thought this was a good thing of her to say, but the brief story of her budding relationship was unfortunately sandwiched by the drowning stories of our other friend’s failed hookups. My mother picked me up afterwards and I sighed. The night was already mature in upstate New York, although the car time only read 10 p.m. “We’ve changed, Mom,” I said, and she laughed because it was only November. “No, really,” I said. “Everyone’s falling in love, or thinking they are.” “What’s the difference?” Mummified in a northeastern winter and studying (waiting) for second semester, I was trying to apply for internships, and my friend was eating all my old chocolate. I had given her permission to do so but, still, the crinkling of the wrappers was getting on my nerves and then there were also the actual noises she made while eating. Twice she said: “I wish someone would write a Tiger Admirers post about me.” After the second time I cheerfully said, “I’m sure someone will! And, really, they’re not that big of a deal anyway.” Although I am now no longer part of the Facebook group, I took a break with her that night and we watched the blue and white posts fly by under the quick swipes of down-arrow key. One post read: “2277 — F**k going out to the street. I just want to have a slow dance with a girl at a beach.” My mother thinks that we do not take love seriously. If I showed her Tiger Admirers she would probably point at the other posts which come up when “beach” is searched for (I mean the ones which mention “beach-ready bods” etc.) I am sure she would be able to find dozens of other posts, too, which would justify her claim. Yet I beg to differ. I would say, “Yes, mom,” but what about the very fact that Tiger Admirers exists: does that not say anything? It does. And it says things in only the way college students are capable of. Tiger Admirers is especially powerful because it utilizes both anonymity and open naming in their strongest forms. The admirer is suddenly an 11th-century troubadour poet, cloaking him or herself while praising his or her own versions of Dante’s Beatrice. The admiree, on the other hand, is placed on a pedestal, deified, complete with his or her own marble-engraved name (the blue hyperlink tagged-name even allows a hovering mouse to check out the thumbnail. Bet the Greeks never thought of that!). Self-effacement is the goal here, to relegate oneself to a nameless mouthpiece of praise. But hold on — I thought the goal of Tiger Admirers was to gain requited love? Or to, alternately, embrace unrequited affections? Or simply to express what might be deemed embarrassing to say in real life? To me, the cathartic nature of Tiger Admirers is what reconciles these two sets of goals: the nominal one of “putting oneself out there” and the actual one of “becoming a nobody.” What more can be asked of a college student? Our lives are filled with similar situations. These things are here, but not present; they are possessed, but never really had. I think about career choices. I think about major declaration. I think about friend circles and the cultivation of a definite self. And I still have in mind the one-night stands, the fleeting hookups, the singular boldness of “Shall we dance?” — romance, perhaps, but not really love. So I am a proponent of Tiger Admirers usage. Aristotle believed in catharsis but Plato did not. I guess I already have a beef with Plato because of his views on art, but when it comes to Tiger Admirers, I’m again an Aristotelian. To me, 2277 was saying less so “F**k going out to the street” but more so, “F**k posting on Tiger Admirers”; less so “I just want to have a slow dance with a girl at a beach” and more so “I just want to say things out loud without feeling stifled by social conventions.” Oh, say it, number 2277. You’ve already begun. Eviscerate this chasm we’ve created. Bridge the gap between falling in love and merely thinking so.|~|Lavinia Liang is a freshman from Poughkeepsie, N.Y.

84704|~|Why I’m choosing never to see my admissions records|~|   April 23 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|As was widely reported in January, students this year have for the first time figured out en masse how to view their supposedly-confidential admission records, thanks to a loophole in Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act discovered by several students at Stanford. Current students are now able to see “written assessments that admission officers gave of applicants, the numerical scores those officers assigned them on a range of factors,” and even sometimes notes from when their file was discussed the by admission committee. According to a report a few weeks ago by The Daily Princetonian, over 300 students have viewed their records at the University in the past few months, with many more scheduled to do so before year’s end. When doing so, students are allowed one hour with their records and are not allowed to bring a cell phone or a camera. Some universities, including Yale and Stanford, have begun to destroy admission records in response to this wave of requests by students to view them, an apparent attempt to preserve the secrecy of what was said about applicants and current students. While I’m not proposing that FERPA be changed to ban such requests, I am advocating that students at the University choose not to exercise this right. There is a value in not knowing why specifically we are here. As I wrote in one of my earlier columns last year, “In not knowing why I got accepted to Princeton, what specific accomplishment or impressive-sounding recommendation put me ‘over the edge’ in the admission committee meeting, I don’t feel defined by any single accomplishment … Not feeling like I have an easy answer to ‘Why are you here?’ makes me instead feel that I don’t have a mantle to uphold in any specific area and can have some flexibility in my choices.” Checking our admission records, we may find that the committee or our readers were incredibly impressed with a certain talent or interest we’ve since given up on or haven’t pursued while here — both of which are fine choices if our interests have changed. There is no need for students to open another opportunity for themselves to feel boxed in by previous accomplishments rather than current goals or interests. Second, the admission committee should be allowed to operate under a large amount of secrecy in order to evaluate applicants in the most frank and honest terms. While I doubt admission officers would change their recommendations solely for this reason, it’s entirely possible that they would marginally alter or soften the tone of their evaluation essay for a given applicant. Knowing that the record could later be subject to public scrutiny (while students can’t take pictures or make copies of the records, they can bring in a notebook with them, and thus quote the material if they so choose), an admission officer might be marginally less honest, open, or blunt in an evaluation of a candidate — especially a well-connected one. Given that the University receives well over 26,000 applications per year, marginal differences do matter in this case, since they are carried out over such a large scale. No one would imagine the extreme example of this phenomenon holding (basically the plot of the movie “Admission”), but a small change in the degree of public scrutiny to which the admission committee operates could still nonetheless have an outsized impact on the process as a whole. Therefore, the committee should be given broad protection from such public scrutiny over the content of its evaluations — not by a change in the law banning review, but by students choosing not to exercise their right to see their admissions files. We do, apparently, have a right to know what was said and written about us when we applied to the University. But that doesn’t at all mean we have to exercise said right — especially not en masse, simply out of our own curiosity. By showing restraint and not looking inside their files, students can retain a larger degree of freedom for themselves and can avoid subjecting the admission committee to an unnecessary and counterproductive degree of scrutiny.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

84706|~|Why body image campaigns get it wrong|~|   April 23 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Colter Smith|~|   Contributor     |~|Every once in a while, my Facebook feed becomes flooded with pictures of students holding up signs or changing their profile pictures as part of the newest campaign to encourage acceptance of one’s body. These photographs are usually captioned with some encouraging phrase, such as “Everyone is beautiful,” to inspire people to talk about their bodies and how they feel about them. No question, problems like anorexia, bulimia and general body image issues are very serious, and it’s important for the University to help students address them. Despite these good intentions, however, I believe that the central themes of these campaigns hurt, rather than help, the cause. There are two traits that must come together in order for people to have insecurities about their bodies. The first is that these people must feel that their bodies aren’t very beautiful or attractive. The second is that they must base a large amount of their self-worth on their attractiveness. Only when people possess both traits can they really be hurt by their body image. It doesn’t hurt someone to be bad at something that they don’t really care about. For instance, I’m a terrible painter. Nonetheless, I don’t value myself based on my painting ability, and so this doesn’t hurt me. These campaigns always attack the first of these two issues. They try to make us believe that everyone’s paintings are fantastic, at least in some way. And while yes, there may be someone who would think my paintings are good, perhaps even amazing, I know that most people would not. Furthermore, almost everyone would agree that there exist many much better painters than me. After enough time, effort and USG campaigns, could I be convinced that my paintings are good? Perhaps. More likely I’d begin to believe that they have some unique and interesting quality about them, even if most people don’t consider them to be wonderful. Even that much is uncertain though. To me, this is exactly what these “love your body” campaigns achieve. They are never going to convince everybody at this school that their body is wonderful and perfect. At the same time, they exacerbate the second problem I alluded to earlier, that of students correlating their self-worth with their attractiveness. For example, take the recent USG “As I Am” campaign, which collected pictures of students holding up signs with the question “What do you feel about your body and why?” along with their answers. Looking at picture after picture of students talking about their bodies and how they feel about them implies to me that my body is something I should be highly concerned with. These pictures tell me that the people around me consider their appearance very important to them and that perhaps I should, too. They make me focus on how I eat. They make me self-conscious about how my friends and peers perceive my beauty. They tell me that I live in a society that really cares about how I look. All of this contributes to a subconscious belief that I should base some of my self-worth on my body and my attractiveness. As I said earlier, without this belief, it’s very difficult for someone to have body image issues. So, instead of running campaigns that focus on “being beautiful,” let’s instead try to explain why it shouldn’t matter. USG should be running campaigns that highlight the great qualities and abilities of the many talented students here independent of their appearances. A much better question for the “As I Am” campaign would have been “Why do you love yourself?” or “What do you believe makes you great?”  Questions like these tell students that the society around them doesn’t judge them based on their body and encourages them to think about the things they do well. While I commend the tireless efforts of the many students and faculty who work to rid the plague of body image problems from this campus, we are looking for the solution in the wrong place. Our current approach not only fails to tackle the problem, but is actually detrimental. If we want a happier campus, we need to encourage students to focus on what causes them to “be” great, rather than what makes them “look” great.|~|Colter Smith is a sophomore from Bronxville, N.Y.

84736|~|Editorial: Campus Rec, step up to the plate|~|   April 23 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Club sports are an integral part of university life for many students. At the University, the more visible varsity sports teams, which accommodate only a small fraction of the student body, are complemented by the large number of club sports. According to the Campus Recreation website, the University has 37 different club sports, rangin from fencing to ultimate frisbee. Open to all University students, regardless of skill level, club sports contribute to the physical health and well-being of the students who participate, as they emphasize peer leadership and student development outside the classroom. Thus, the Editorial Board recommends that Campus Rec better support clubs with start-up funding and fundraising assistance. Club sports face specific challenges that don’t exist for Varsity sports. For clubs just starting up, Campus Rec requires that the officers submit paperwork and attend meetings and training sessions, but does not allocate funding for them from the budget that year, as the Sport Clubs Handbook says that “new clubs are ineligible for financial support until the next budget cycle and full school year.” But for club sports still getting organized, unlike other established clubs, more start-up funds for expenses such as equipment may be necessary, not less. The Board recognizes that the University may want club founders to demonstrate that students are interested in participating in their sport before funding is guaranteed, but the Board believes more clubs are likely to suffer under the current policy than waste funds under a new policy. New clubs need money upfront, and the Board recommends that Campus Rec provide more assistance, whether in the form of actual financial resources or fundraising help, to alleviate this problem. Additionally, for club sports that have already been established, Campus Rec could provide greater help in fundraising throughout the school year. Currently, the club sports handbook lists fundraising options as “soliciting donations from friends, family, and alumni and working different events around campus.” However, “clubs are only allowed to actively solicit funds from parents and alumni during the Fall semester.” Even though the Office of Development helps teams send out solicitation letters, newsletters, email correspondence and telephone campaigns, some club sports find themselves without the funds necessary to compete. To facilitate more fundraising, Campus Rec could offer opportunities for club sports to form fundraising coalitions, and help them hold fundraising events where the proceeds would be awarded fairly, for example, based on the number of each club sport’s participants. Because club sports play an important role in the lives of University students, the Board recommends that Campus Rec provide more financial assistance to club sports teams. Implementing these measures into next year’s handbook policies would help Campus Rec cover all their bases.|~|
84545|~|Reconsidering political correctness	|~|   April 22 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|When it came time a few weeks ago for administrators at Kean University to pick a commencement speaker, I imagine that Common seemed like a safe choice. He has always been lauded as a “conscious” rapper (whatever that implies) who starred in a romantic comedy, happens to be a pescatarian, wrote a book about his mom, has a charity dedicated to supporting underprivileged youth and, of course, co-wrote the song “Glory” with John Legend for the movie “Selma.” Somehow, though, someone managed to take offense — New Jersey State Troopers Fraternal Association president Chris Burgos called the invitation a “slap in the face” to police officers. Apparently, Burgos had managed to dig up a fifteen-year-old song dedicated to Assata Shakur, the controversial figure condemned by some as a terrorist while vigorously defended by others. Around the same time that Princeton students were rallying against Big Sean, a police organization was protesting against another artist of color from a working-class background in a struggling Midwestern city. This incident is an example of what Paul Krugman refers to as “right-wing political correctness.” This kind of conservative correctness may have hit its peak in the early days of the Iraq War, when Congress actually voted to rename cafeteria french fries “freedom fries.” Then there are countless instances of fundamentalist Christian groups rallying against portrayals of homosexuality in entertainment. Apparently even AP US History is under fire. These are cases where certain words or phrases become unacceptable not because of the way they demean marginalized groups, but because of the way that they question an established “American” norm — a set of traditional nationalistic, Christian or free market values. Of course, when people try to make language more inclusive of and welcoming to members of marginalized groups, they become politically correct “social justice warriors.” But language designed to make “job creators” (a term that many conservatives use in place of “the wealthy”) more comfortable somehow just qualifies as the common decency to refrain from class warfare. I mention all this to call into question the assumptions behind the phrase “political correctness,” since I’ve heard it thrown around on campus a lot recently. Julius Dixon ’16 probably captured the feelings of over four hundred students who liked his Facebook status when he wrote: “To the PC police and all other butthurt parties — the world is not here to cater to you.” I have also observed a large amount of conservative correctness. The fact that columnists Newby Parton, Christian Wawrzonek, Steve Swanson and the Editorial Board all felt compelled write very similar columns in The Daily Princetonian criticizing the protest of Eisgruber’s speech suggests that certain language — such as “cultural appropriation” or “racism” — makes some people at Princeton uncomfortable beyond a mere philosophical commitment to free speech. I personally differ somewhat from the protesters in my interpretation of Eisgruber’s email, and I too tend to adhere to a fairly liberal standard of free speech — but the fact that these writers all took the opportunity to criticize a small group of brave students demonstrating on behalf of peers who were also hurt by events on campus suggests not only that they actually take this kind of protest as a serious threat against free speech. This kind of reaction also implies a deeper kind of discomfort with serious discussion about problems for minorities on campus. Wawrzonek writes, “I was dismissed because of my race and insulted because my opinion did not align with an absurdly overhyped narrative.” He says that he’s not looking for sympathy, but he must have felt injured enough by a few Facebook comments to write a substance-free column about not “fighting discrimination with discrimination.” Meanwhile, all four parties ignore what the real threat to free speech is: those ugly, reactionary instincts that manifest themselves under the cover of anonymity and threaten those students brave enough to exercise their freedom of speech. It’s hard to explain the ugly reactions that appear under the cover of anonymity any other way than to directly call out the sensitivity of those of us with privilege who find that conversations about race, class, gender or sexuality make us feel personally uncomfortable. Anonymity — whether it comes in the form of posting on Yik Yak or tearing down pro- and anti-divestment posters — severs speech from accountability. It also enables students to single out individuals like Joanna Anyanwu ’15 who, by vocally calling attention to the problems that minority students face on campus, apparently make non-minority students feel “victimized.” Free speech cannot fulfill its promise as long as students like Anyanwu who choose to use this freedom face intimidation from their own peers. To an alarming degree, I’ve heard many students like Wawrzonek and Yik Yak users justify their complaints about campus dialogue with narratives of reverse-discrimination — the biggest excuse for self-pity and over-sensitivity around today. Conservative correctness is strong among our student body, and in combination with anonymity it represents a serious threat to our freedom of speech.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I.

84550|~|Princeton’s laboratory animal research program|~|   April 22 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Pablo G. Debenedetti Two articles published recently in The Daily Princetonian, “U. accused of violating Animal Welfare Act in marmoset monkey incident,” by Cassidy Tucker (published on April 13) and “Opaque Transparency: What we (don’t) know about Princeton’s animal experimentation,” by Courtney Buoncore ’18 and Gwyndolyn Goldfeder ’18 (published on April 20), prompt me to write about Princeton’s outstanding laboratory animal research program. As members of a world-renowned research university, Princeton scholars explore the frontiers of knowledge in fields ranging from East Asian studies to physics, from history to civil and environmental engineering. Just as research in history requires the use of historical documents, research in some areas, such as the life sciences, includes work with animals. Animals are used in research only when no alternatives exist to address specific scientific questions. Neuroscience, for example, aims to understand how the brain works and to discover treatments for complex neurological disorders — both of which are impossible without the use of animal models. The study of animals is also essential for exploring many basic biological and behavioral processes, understanding animal ecosystems and modeling human disease. Many medicines, devices and treatments that we heavily use and rely upon today were discovered, developed or perfected thanks to laboratory animal research, including asthma inhalers, magnetic resonance imaging, the tetanus vaccine, modern anesthetics, blood transfusions and insulin, to name but a select few. Some examples of fundamental questions being pursued at Princeton involving the use of animals in research include uncovering the mechanisms underlying the establishment of left-right asymmetry in the vertebrate body plan, understanding the relationship between short-term memory and an animal’s ability to navigate its environment and elucidating the manner in which individual cells integrate biochemical and mechanical signals to direct the development of organs such as lungs and mammary glands. The fruits of this research are reported in peer-reviewed scientific journals in the form of articles that have always provided detailed, open and transparent information on the work conducted at Princeton. While the majority of Americans support research and even medical testing involving animals, there will always be persons who oppose research with animals despite the clear benefits to society. At Princeton we acknowledge and respect such differences of opinion, and we are committed to the humane and responsible use of animals in research. Throughout the nation, research with animals is conducted according to a set of high standards developed by veterinary professionals, ethicists, scientists, community members and regulators, and most such research is also conducted in accordance with additional voluntary international accreditation standards. Princeton is no exception.  The standards set forth by the community and agreed upon by Princeton’s researchers are publicly available to Princetonians through the Office of Research Integrity and Assurance website: http://www.princeton.edu/ria/animal-research-protectio/ As Dean for Research, I am committed to ensuring that there is strong leadership and infrastructure to support and oversee research involving animals and to provide the best care and welfare as students and faculty make discoveries that contribute to knowledge and societal wellbeing. I am proud of the extraordinary quality of our laboratory animal research program and of its outstanding record of compliance, which includes three consecutive unannounced inspections by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) with no findings of non-compliance and a very recent successful accreditation visit by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALACi). The latter was a voluntary accreditation exercise, reflecting Princeton’s commitment to exceeding the standards of animal care, husbandry and treatment mandated by law. Princeton’s laboratory animal research program contributes in a major way to advancing the frontiers of knowledge and to saving and prolonging the lives of countless human beings (and animals). It does so while upholding the highest standards of regulatory compliance and of humane and responsible treatment of animals.|~|Pablo G.

84400|~|Let’s talk about kale|~|   April 22 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Nicholas Wu|~|   Contributor     |~|Kale is beloved by hipsters and foodies across the country, making it one of the most stereotyped vegetables on the planet. Any casual observer will have noticed the influx of kale into the dining halls. Its spread is unstoppable, seeping into the salad bar (yummy), infiltrating the hot food line (mixed results — kale on pizza is not an ideal combination) and, given time, might even migrate into the dessert area. Kale-flavored ice cream, for its part, has made fleeting appearances at the Bent Spoon, while Starbucks has been selling kale-infused smoothies. One wonders if Big Kale is in cahoots with Campus Dining Services. Admittedly, I actually enjoy the taste of kale and appreciate its nutritional benefits. However, there is a fine line between caring about the taste and nutrition of a food item and lapsing into fallacious arguments about its chemical contents. In one corner of the Internet lies the blog of Vani Hari, who goes by the pen name of “Food Babe.” Major media outlets first covered her during the controversy about Subway sandwiches and yoga mat chemicals. Her blog had petitioned Subway to address the particular chemical azodicarbonamide. The problem is Hari’s claims were based entirely on nonexistent science, scaring people for nothing. NPR, generally a friend of American liberals like Hari far and wide (Hari was a 2012 Democratic National Convention delegate), reported that “outside of occupational exposure, there’s no evidence that there’s any risk at all to consumers” and the allegedly harmful chemical was just used to improve the dough. In any case, Subway went and removed the chemical from its breads to avoid any more bad press. Hari’s blog has accrued a fair amount of press lately, with critical articles about her in the Atlantic and the New York Times, among others, published in the last few months. The popularity of Hari’s blog, according to the New York Times, is entirely driven by a fear among young people of the influence wielded by big companies and the adulteration of products, perfectly rational fears that have been whipped into hysteria. It’s like the classic joke about people being scared about “dihydrogen monoxide” exposure. Dihydrogen monoxide is just another way of saying H2O or water, but it can be very easy to scare people with foreign-sounding scientific concepts. There can be severe health consequences of subscribing to these unfounded claims. To return to my earlier point about kale, Hari’s blog says, “The enzymes released from kale go in to your liver and trigger cancer fighting chemicals that literally dissolve unhealthy cells throughout your body. Animals with tumors are given a diet of kale and their tumors actually shrink.” It’s a risible claim. If that really were the case, it’s time to stop the production of all cancer-fighting drugs and replace them with kale. No citation is given for that claim on her website. It is to be accepted as scientific fact, delivered by Hari for consumption by the followers of her blog and her nearly one million Facebook likers. This is unacceptable from a public health perspective. Members of the scientific community have called her the “Jenny McCarthy of food” (given her prominent role in spreading fears that vaccination causes autism), but such an approach will not convince her thousands of followers otherwise. For a minute, let’s take Hari’s logic and run with it. Microwave ovens cause cancer. Donuts cause cancer because of the chemicals in them. Non-organic yogurt causes cancer. Bread preservatives cause attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In essence, everything you eat is bad for you or carcinogenic, according to Hari. Good-bye, readers of the Daily Princetonian. It’s time for me to put on a tinfoil hat and hide in a cave, never to eat anything again except for free-trade, organic kale, irrigated only with the finest glacial water from the Himalayas. There’s certainly a point to be made about regulatory capture and the effectiveness of food safety agencies. But the hysteria caused by blogs like Hari’s distracts from real food safety issues like salmonella outbreaks in eggs, spinach and peanut butter, which were some of the major recall targets in recent years. Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Food Safety Modernization Act in 2010 in response to the salmonella outbreaks, but just last week, the New York Times reported that the FDA has received less than half of the money that it needed to implement those regulations. Now that’s a better place to start. The ire of Hari’s blog would be better directed toward the legislators in Congress that fail to give regulatory agencies the resources they really need to keep Americans safe from actual poisons. Those bacterial outbreaks are the real threat to people, as opposed to the imagined threats that Hari conjures up, and addressing this issue requires a shift in priorities. Kale has not yet been the subject of a salmonella outbreak. Let’s keep it that way.|~|Nicholas Wu is a freshman from Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich. He can be reached at nmwu@princeton.edu. 
84394|~|Argumentum ad yikyakum|~|   April 21 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Avaneesh Narla|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.” — Oscar Wilde In high school, I was a big fan of anonymity. I felt that a fear of repercussions often hindered people’s willingness to be outspoken, even about issues that they might have been passionate about or when they could contribute significantly to the conversation. Anonymity offers a stage to a silenced argument: a way to project the oppressed idea. However, I have since become cautious regarding the benefits of anonymity. The recent dialogue on campus and the role of Yik Yak in it highlight why anonymity should be treated carefully. I assert that anonymous forums such as Yik Yak should not be considered forums for dialogue and that anonymous posts on these forums should not by themselves be considered prevailing opinions among the student population. Yik Yak is great as a forum for mildly clever statements and a vent for complaints — let’s leave it as such. Anonymity offers those who have contemplated and developed thoughts about an issue a platform to present their arguments without the fear that their identities would be a detriment or expose them to ad hominem attacks. But for anonymity to be effective, it requires an especially well-reasoned argument. Arguments with names attached allow the authors to respond to criticism and develop their arguments; anonymous arguments cannot rely on the author’s input to better interpret and develop those ideas. Which begs the question: can Yik Yak serve as a forum for well-reasoned anonymous arguments? Yik Yak posters don’t have the opportunity to elaborate and explain in limited space, and it’s questionable whether they have taken the effort to present their arguments. Yik Yak is not a forum for dialogue or argumentation and should not be treated as such. But do anonymous sources offer a window into the thoughts of members of the student body — a student body that will soon become members of society at large and, if history is any indication, an influential part of it? I firmly don’t believe so. Many people who post on Yik Yak clearly confess that they are often either flat-out lying about their true beliefs or posting liberal modifications of their thoughts in hopes of upvotes. I confess to having lied on most posts and have witnessed many friends post provocative arguments that they themselves don’t believe in, hoping to gain fake internet points. Yik Yak posters don’t post to present an idea that others would learn from, but post to present an idea that others would like and upvote. Strong provocative arguments are especially successful at doing that (like expressing anger at certain groups), even if they don’t represent the poster’s beliefs and aren’t well-reasoned. Thus, most posts may not indicate any prevailing mentality but are just attempts at fake internet popularity. But are upvotes an indication of student mentality? Probably not. Innumerable psychology studies confirm the dynamics of group mentalities; in the case that a post has more than a certain number of votes, one is instinctively likely to upvote it even if given time to consider it, they wouldn’t agree with it. Furthermore, I wonder what proportion of the student body is actually on Yik Yak, let alone posting on it. The so-called one percent rule of the Internet is well-documented and states that only one percent of the members create new content on a website, while 99 percent just “lurk.” How much it is true for Yik Yak may be disputed, but it is probably still applicable. Should the voices of such a miniscule proportion of the student body be considered so strongly? Yik Yak posters are what anonymous internet forum commenters became long ago: a small group of people who present arguments without much reasoning and can get away with unreasoned statements. Yik Yak is great for crude jokes and complaints, but we shouldn’t use it as a forum for arguments/dialogue or consider it as indicative of campus mentality. I would urge everyone to reason and discuss (as Ryan Dukeman urged a few days ago in a column in The Daily Princetonian) rather than pay attention to unreasoned provocative posts on an anonymous forum. Relying on Yik Yak — whether it is to draw attention to campus issues or to martyrize someone for their cause — is not okay; no anonymous platform is appropriate for that type of dialogue.|~|Avaneesh Narla is a sophomore from Calcutta, India.

Paltrow’s greatest flaw in the public eye has been her inability to relate with others, more so than a typical Hollywood celebrity. Consequently, I was not surprised when I heard about what had recently put her in headlines. Last week, Paltrow accepted a challenge from the Food Bank of New York City by attempted to live on a one-week grocery budget of $29, the average amount families receive per person through SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). She took a picture of the food she had bought and posted it to her Twitter account, with a status saying, “This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store—what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week.” I guessed that Paltrow had hoped to expose herself to the bleak realities of everyday lives for millions on Americans. What I wondered about most was how she would go about executing the challenge, and what effect, if any, she hoped to have after it. I am sure no matter how Paltrow performed the challenge, she would have received some criticism by virtue of her image as privileged and unaware. Still, even with this in mind, one cannot help understanding her critics when looking at the photo she tweeted. On a table laid a carton of one dozen eggs, brown rice, black beans, peas, tortillas and a colorful array of fresh vegetables, lime and cilantro. Although Paltrow may have intended to show just how difficult it is to maintain a healthy diet on the budget food stamps provides, she missed the mark in buying such a large amount of fresh food at all. Many families enrolled in SNAP live in food deserts, where fresh vegetables and fruit are not readily available in inner cities. Furthermore, several of these families do not have access to a vehicle to reach markets where food like this is sold, as they depend on public transportation. What’s worse, even Paltrow was only able to sustain her experiment for four days. Putting aside the issue of just how unrealistic her purchases were, there remains a slew of questions and concerns for challenges like these. What does embarking on a challenge like this achieve? I suppose one aim could be to better one’s public or personal image. Another motive could be to increase understanding of the impoverished lives many around us lead. However, if carelessly executed, this can quickly morph into poverty tourism, where outsiders can seek novelty in the harsh realities of hunger, homelessness and the aftermath of natural disaster while being able to escape at any given moment. Ever the optimist, I think most people enter with the intention of educating themselves on issues like food security that, while not directly affecting them, are pressing for millions of families around the world. Yet, is this reason enough? Satisfying one’s curiosity may be innocent enough, and an attempt to gain a new outlook is commendable. We don’t have to look as far as Hollywood to find people seeking an experience that will put their own lives in perspective. Only last week, the Center for Jewish Life, Pace Center for Civic Engagement and Oxfam America sponsored the Hunger Banquet, where participants received a ticket assigning them to an income bracket and life narrative, all based on current statistics on poverty. The bracket you were in determined what sort of meal you would receive. Guests heard from a graduate student and former Oxfam CHANGE fellow, and at dinner’s end, they were asked to share thoughts on the evening. Lastly, those participating were “invited…to take action to right the wrong of poverty.” The final sentence is critical, because frankly, I do not think wanting to learn is enough. Rather, I do not think wanting to learn about important social issues warrants entering a community where what was once a distant policy issue becomes someone’s everyday life. If you are going to adopt someone’s personal space and narrative momentarily so that you can leave more knowledgeable than when you entered, it is your responsibility to do something meaningful with what you have learned. I have no doubt that the controversy of the “SNAP challenge” will soon go away. Poverty is a well-hidden issue that most Americans do not encounter unless they directly experience it. When it gains the attention it deserves, the realization that solutions are complex and may come at a personal cost turns many newfound advocates away. Yet at the very least, we can commend Gwyneth Paltrow for using her fame to turn the spotlight on the issue. Perhaps before another issue takes its place, a bill or program can address the steady decline on resources used to fight poverty. Because of course, even the most well-intentioned people can escape the slum they visit or prematurely end their challenge like Paltrow did. Without comprehensive change, these “challenges” are never-ending realities for millions. Lea Trusty is a junior from Saint Rose, La. She can reached at ltrusty@princeton.edu.|~|
84441|~|Disinvestment is an empty moral gesture|~|   April 21 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Uwe Reinhardt It is always to be welcomed when students give written or spoken expression to their moral sentiments on issues outside the University’s comfortable cocoon and debate these sentiments in a manner that befits a great university. At the same time, it is less heartening when these expressions lead to facile and morally empty policy recommendations for the operation of the University at large. From the viewpoint of an economist, for example, having the University’s investment arm, PRINCO, rid itself of the stock certificates on a set of companies whose role in Israel and the West Bank is deplored by the advocates of disinvestment strikes me as such an empty gesture. One certainly can debate this issue from a strictly partisan basis, favoring one side or the other, as different factions on this campus have amply done. One can also debate whether it is reasonable to force upon the University community a general policy on which that community is as sharply divided as it is on this issue. The trustees of Stanford, for example, just decided to vote against disinvestment on this ground. Finally, one may forever debate the proper boundary for disinvestment in general. American corporations can become candidates for disinvestment for any number of reasons on which there are strong feelings by one group or another on this campus. Should PRINCO divest from any company that does business with countries that by our standards violate human rights — for example, say, those of women? Should PRINCO dump the stocks of the manufacturers of drones or guns? In this commentary I will not address any of these contentious points on which we all have strong views, no doubt, and instead ask what goals disinvestment actually is meant to achieve and whether it actually can achieve them. The proponents of disinvestment seem to theorize that disinvestment would throw sand into the operation of the target companies and thus dissuade them from activities of which the protesters disapprove. Does that actually make economic sense in a fluid global capital market? Most, if not all, of the target companies’ shares of stock held in PRINCO’s portfolio were purchased by PRINCO in the market for stocks that had already been issued by the company years ago. One might call it the “pre-owned” or “second-hand” market for stocks. Does anyone sincerely believe that if a handful of American and European universities divested themselves of stock in a company, it would seriously hurt that company’s ability to raise equity capital from other investors in a global stock market, especially now, as global capital markets are awash in capital scouring the world for profitable investment opportunities? True, if all universities inclined to disinvest were to do so in concert at one time, there might be a very short-run downward blip in the market price of the target company’s stock. But alert investors around the world — in the United States, in Europe, in Asia and in the Middle East — forever on the lookout for arbitrage opportunities would see in that downward blip a buying opportunity and instantly take advantage of it. The CFOs of the target companies might report to their boards of directors that a temporary blip in the company’s stock price had occurred and why it had occurred, but they would also quickly assure the board that soon the market price of the stock will trend up again toward the intrinsic value of the stock. The latter depends strictly on the cash inflow expected by investors from the stock and the discount rate at which future investors translate expected future cash flows into present values, which then become their bid prices for the stock. Fluctuations of stock prices about their intrinsic values are taken with equanimity in the real world. Given this likely scenario, what would disinvestment actually achieve? The only way the market price of the company’s stock could be directly impacted for any length of time would be to target the firm’s income statement in a way that would depress earnings per share for some time and perhaps permanently. The disinvestment being proposed now does not do that. Therefore, I judge it to be an empty gesture. I also judge it a facile gesture. Moral statements have more force, more personal sacrifice behind them, thanks to their advocates. What sacrifice do the advocates of disinvestment actually personally bear for that advocacy? I am hard put to think of any. Even if the policy were to impose a permanent loss on PRINCO, that is, on the University at large, who actually would bear these economic consequences? Universities quite often serve as the wellspring for empty moral gestures. During the Vietnam War, for example, our students struck the academic process in a protest over that war. To give their moral outrage visible expression, they refused en masse to sit for final examinations. In principle, the refusal to sit for exams should have entailed that seniors would fail to graduate that year and that juniors would be forced to take an extra course the following year. That personal sacrifice might have caught the attention of the media. As it turned out, predictably, the Registrar’s Office, presumably with the blessing of Nassau Hall, fixed it somehow so that everyone got credit for his or her spring courses anyhow and every senior graduated on time. But, presumably, a moral statement had been made in academia. I invite the current proponents of disinvestment to explain in these pages where I err in my theory, if I do, and why their proposed policy is neither facile nor an empty gesture.|~|Uwe Reinhardt is a professor of economics and public affairs at the University.

84277|~|Opaque transparency: What we (don’t) know about Princeton’s animal experimentation|~|   April 20 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Courtney Buoncore ’18 and Gwyndolyn Goldfeder ’18 Most Princeton students operate under the assumption that our campus promotes intellectual and moral integrity, as well as academic transparency. And yet, many Princeton students are only aware of the existence of laboratory animals thanks to recent articles in the Daily Princetonian like “U. accused of violating Animal Welfare Act in marmoset monkey incident.” However, even with this article, how many Princeton students truly know what experiments are being performed on animals on this very campus? Could you, if asked, talk about the types of animals we have here? The vast majority of you will likely say no, or more likely, may think that these questions are unimportant. Yet the purpose of these questions is not to argue that our research facilities are entirely immoral, nor to declare unmitigated disgust at those who practice such techniques. Rather, we aim to encourage the realization that we, as a student body, simply do not know the details of what goes on in the depths of certain research facilities. On a campus that promotes integrity, honesty and honor among the student body, and rightfully demands transparency about so many other issues, including mental health and sexual assault policies, it only follows that we should also demand this transparency in regards to the policies and conditions of the live animals kept on campus for experimentation. This is an issue that affects a significant portion of students on this campus. Some of you will even directly work with these animals during your Princeton careers, as JPs and theses in certain departments include experimentation for independent research. Some of you might be surprised to learn that researchers on this campus have cut open the heads of macaques and stuck in head posts, according to their article they published for the Public Library of Science journal. These posts are screwed into the monkeys’ skulls to secure the animal. The monkey is then placed in a primate chair, a contraption that includes Velcro wrist restraints for the purpose of immobilization. After being prepared thusly, these macaques had to stare for hours at a screen while researchers measured their visual and auditory responses. As graphic as this description may seem, it recounts standard and common procedures that adhere to regulations. Princeton, however, does not always adhere to such regulations. Based on several Freedom of Information requests, the Department of Agriculture’s Animals and Plant Health Inspection Service has given us warnings in the past for failing to comply with certain federal standards. Rats set aside for euthanization were forgotten for over twelve hours, left in a cage that lacked food, water or bedding. When discovered, these rats were immediately put to death. In another instance, researchers failed to adequately confirm the death of several baby mice who were euthanized. These pups, while alive, were stored in a freezer with the carcasses of other mice. When found, they were also immediately euthanized. Though Princeton became aware of the misconduct and re-trained laboratory staff, this negligence of the welfare of the animals was hardly publicized. Human mistakes may perhaps be forgiven; such occurrences are nothing if not natural. What cannot be forgiven, however, is the shroud of vague responses and conveniently omitted information that this campus is in the habit of propagating with regards to the nature and welfare of the research animals here. So far, Princeton has declined to comment on the recent ‘Prince’ article involving the violation of the Animal Welfare Act, mentioned above. Dayton Martindale’s article in the Nass highlights the circuitous responses of University spokesperson Martin Mbugua, as well as Mbugua’s refusal to allow interaction with the laboratory technicians who would have had the best and most accurate information to share. Moving forward, it is essential that the University be absolutely transparent in its discussion of the practices of its laboratories. When asked, information should be given freely; questions should not be avoided, but addressed honestly and openly. Ignorance might be bliss, but it does not excuse neglect, abuse or misunderstanding, especially when it is entirely in our power to force the issue. As a student body, we must demand transparency. We have a right to ask, and more importantly, we have a right to know.|~|Courtney Buoncore is a freshman from New York. She can be reached at buoncore@princeton.edu.

84279|~|Boycotting Big Sean|~|   April 20 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|When I first saw the Lawnparties announcement video, my initial reaction was, “What a tasteless and offensive early April fools joke.” When I found out that the man rapping about a “little stupid-ass bitch” would, in fact, be the headlining act in May, I was not shocked or horrified. I did not write to USG. I did not even discuss the event with my friends. I felt disappointed in Princeton’s choice and irritated that my tuition dollars would be sponsoring a performance that at best normalizes and at worst celebrates misogyny and homophobia — societal trends I hope to spend the rest of my life fighting. Still, my reaction can probably best be described as lukewarm resentment. My feelings have since shifted dramatically toward the ‘angry’ end of the emotional spectrum. This development is not a result of some new knowledge or deeper insight into Big Sean’s background or his music. My growing irritation is prompted by the reactions of peers who condemn or denigrate the anti-Big Sean petition signers. Students shrug and say, “If you don’t like Big Sean, don’t go,” implying that this is nothing more complicated than a case of clashing subjective musical tastes. Others publish vicious ad hominem insults on Yik Yak targeting the petition’s organizers. Some assert that the signatories are hypocrites or racists. There is a wide gap — just how wide is becoming clearer by the day — between those signing the petition and those calling out the petition signers. One of the reasons behind the growing breach is the substitution of code words and activist language for real explanations. Loaded phrases like “rape culture” and “misogyny” are useless when the people using them don’t unpack the load with logical arguments and emotional insight. Those who wish to effect change need to explain why they find certain lyrics offensive and why those who aren’t offended should care. Should the burden of explanation fall upon students rather than upon Princeton faculty and staff? Maybe not, although I think the very prevalence of this question — now so frequently posed rhetorically, when it’s formulated as a question at all — indicates a troubling abdication of responsibility on the part of the students who demand change. This is what I hear when Big Sean mentions women in his songs: At first, just contempt. Casual contempt. Catchy disrespect and lyrical scathe. But, with growing unease, I understand that “woman” has been wholly transformed into “bitch.” She doesn’t even get the typical infantilizing label of “girl.” Her importance and her relationship with Big Sean are reduced to whether or not she sleeps with him, as is the importance of all the women he sings about. When I listen to these lyrics, I recall the first time I heard myself called a bitch and the deep-seated derision for an entire gender that the word implies. I think of three male teenagers lounging on a pier, one raucously inviting me to sleep with him as I hurry past and his friends laugh. I think of a friend walking home who was followed for several blocks by a lecherous old man and I think of a high school girl I know who deals with severe psychological trauma because her neighbor attacked her and I think of a friend’s sister who was groped by a drunken stranger one night in an eating club because she was walking out of the bathroom and because it was nighttime and because he was drunk and because she was female. No — those reasons don’t make sense to me, either. Again, my initial response to Big Sean’s music was nothing more potent than a shiver of disgust. But the limited extent of that reaction speaks volumes in and of itself. The level of inurement society persuades us to accept upon ourselves is as appalling as the refrain of IDFWU. In fact, that particular kind of inurement is intimately linked to the refrain of IDFWU. If you are a self-respecting, equality-loving feminist woman or man you will absolutely continue to be one after listening to any number of Big Sean’s songs, but will you call out your friends when they use similar slurs against women in casual conversations? Will you be as revolted by sexual objectification as you were when you first understood what that phrase meant? Maybe. But I’m not sure why we’re paying for the pleasure of testing our misogyny-toleration meters. So go to Lawnparties. Have a good time. But when you’re finished dancing and parroting crude misogynistic song lyrics, remember the people who are not there. Try to understand why they did not attend. And try to cast off that little bit of acceptance, that tolerance for reducing women to “bitches” and fuckable objects that has almost inevitably infected the way you think each time you and the performer on stage sing the chorus of his most popular hit.|~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio.

84281|~|The growing inefficacy of photo campaigns|~|   April 20 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|This year multiple photo campaigns were launched and executed by a variety of different groups. Just this semester, we have had the USG Body Image campaign, the SHARE Consent campaign, the Hidden Minority photo campaign and more. Although these causes are important and worthwhile, and the passion of the students running them is commendable, the repeated use of the same tactic has strongly decreased efficacy. The reasons for using photo campaigns are obvious and understandable. Since the majority of students are active on social media, creating a photo series that can be shared on online platforms is an easy way of reaching people. Every comment and like becomes a free advertisement. Another reason for the use of these photographic tactics is that they get people talking. The first large-scale profile picture changing for a cause that I can remember this year was the Princeton Perspective Project. The way people reacted to that effort by talking a lot about it after the photos were published probably inspired other groups to make similar moves. However, this is a small community and so the same audience is being reached with each successive photo campaign. This decidedly dulls the impact. It is no longer notable to see that one of your classmates has changed his or her Facebook profile picture to a standardized and stylized picture promoting some event or cause. Because it is no longer special, people aren’t necessarily stopping to even see what the cause is or why people are participating in it. In other words, the primary goal of raising awareness in this method cannot be achieved, because everyone is too used to the tools being used. It does not help that most of these campaigns are very visibly similar to one another. They generally have the student standing in front of an attractive backdrop (often outdoors now that the weather has gotten nicer), displaying messages written on pieces of paper, white boards or even the participants’ body parts. This format is chosen because it is aesthetically pleasing and because seeing people’s support written out in their own handwriting is inherently powerful. However, seeing all these similarly composed photographs, one after another, means that you cannot help but see them all as a blur of well-meaning causes. This is especially true because the messages all tend to be worded in a similar way as well. My point is not that I am against photo campaigns. I have participated in some of the above-mentioned campaigns. I see both the planners and the participators as trying their best to get people interested in a cause that means something to them. I just think that in the future, we can do something to make these attempts stand out from one another. It could be that the solution is taking a break from photo campaigns for a while. I think that the creative minds in all these organizations could find a different way to reach their target audiences. After all, the goal is to attract attention. For better or for worse, photo campaigns do not have the ability to do that anymore. We expect them, so we don’t notice them. Perhaps organizations could start sharing creative infographics online instead. Perhaps they could make the photo campaigns physical, with a series of posters around campus. Although the enormous number of posters currently plastered everywhere might make that seem even less effective, the novelty of seeing a familiar face in a context where you don’t expect to see it — like on a poster somewhere on campus — is inherently more eye catching than seeing it on social media. Of course, that doesn’t mean that all organizations should switch to either of the above solutions. That would just be shifting the problem. Instead, each organization should ideally try to find a new solution to the problem of attracting attention. In any case, for the time being, let’s slow down with the photo campaigns.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va. She can be reached at zmubarak@princeton.edu.

84136|~|Editorial: Vote "No" on divestment|~|   April 19 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|From noon today through noon on Wednesday, voting will take place in the Spring USG Elections. The ballot includes a referendum to determine if Princeton students will call on the Trustees “to divest [the University’s endowment] from multinational corporations that maintain the infrastructure of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.” The Board urges students to vote no on the divestment referendum. We believe that the University should not directly insert itself in heavily politicized issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially when such issues have been the source of widespread disagreement on campus. Further, we consider the specific condemnation of Israel’s actions without similar condemnation of worse conduct exhibited by other nations to be a philosophically inconsistent show of ‘selective outrage.’ Vigorous campus debate on divestment this year demonstrates the divisive nature of the issue within the University community. During the fall semester, a petition calling for divestment from companies that “contribute to or profit from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank” and two counter petitions were circulated. Similar activism has occurred during the spring semester. We believe that robust debates regarding important issues are essential to a healthy university community; however, the spirited debate on divestment shows precisely why students should vote no on the referendum. The Board believes, as we have in the past, that divestment should only be reserved for issues about which there is substantial consensus among members of the University community. The endowment implicitly represents the entire University community not only because it is funded by alumni donations, but also because it is Princeton’s primary source of revenue. As a result, the endowment’s neutrality should be maintained and its investment practices should not be politicized. If the University were to divest from corporations involved in the occupation of the West Bank, it would be taking an official stance on one of the most controversial political issues in both campus and international politics. This would not only politicize the endowment, but it would also be counter to the University’s commitment to healthy academic discourse. Campus discourse will not end after the student body votes on the referendum. If the University divests, it will, therefore, adopt a political stance on a divisive and complicated disagreement. Given the University’s commitment to fostering discussion and dialogue where controversy exists, divestment is improper. The University should not intervene. The divestment referendum’s focus on Israel’s actions in the Israel-Palestine conflict is problematic because it ignores immeasurably worse conduct by other nations around the world. At a recent forum sponsored by No Divest, Institute for Advanced Study Professor Emeritus Michael Walzer criticized the divestment movement because, he argued, the left cannot maintain what he characterized as ‘selective outrage’ towards Israel alone. We agree with Walzer that divestment is ‘morally untenable’ because it condemns Israel for purported atrocities that pale in comparison to others on which the movement remains markedly silent. We have not, for instance, seen active movements to divest from Chinese companies for profiting from oppression in Tibet or Iran for its active support of violent terrorist groups. Some might argue that there should be a higher expectation of conduct for liberal democracies such as Israel; however, we consider this argument to be misguided because any nation, democratic or not, can perform an action that produces certain unfavorable consequences. Given that harms caused by Israel’s actions exist on a much larger scale in other parts of the world due to the actions of other nations, we believe that these nations should be similarly condemned irrespective of their governing philosophies. In this way, the democratic nature of the Israeli government is not a proper justification for condemnation; hence, we still do not condone selective outrage. Divestment has been one of the most active and controversial campus debates of this academic year. The Board firmly believes that a university community should be one committed to encouraging open discourse on important issues, and forcing the University to take a stance in these politicized debates undermines that commitment. We strongly urge students to vote no on the referendum.

84130|~|Divestment: It's about real people|~|   April 19 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Lina Saud ’15 We grew up in a world intimately tied to the land of our parents and grandparents. Olive oil, in particular, has always been a staple of daily life. We ate bread soaked in olive oil with breakfast, lunch and dinner. We drank a spoonful of olive oil when we had a sore throat. We rubbed olive oil on our rashes, used it as a hair mask, and reached for it when our bikes have a squeaky wheel. Ours is an unexplainable cherishing of olive oil. I only recognized where my Palestinian-American family’s obsession stemmed from in my travels to the West Bank to visit my grandparents. In this village near Ramallah, olive trees dot hills as far as the eye can see. To the right is Jerusalem, far in the distance. And a lone Israeli settlement stood a few hills away. Each summer we returned, and each summer it seemed that another hill was cleared of its olive trees, bearing another settlement on confiscated Palestinian land closer than the one before. When I was a teenager, my grandfather walked me to the olive orchards near his home. “They’ve been annexed,” he explained in Arabic — this land, these olive trees, they were no longer his. I looked at the trees around me, and understood for the first time why olive oil was like gold to my family. On April 20-22, University undergraduates will vote on the Princeton Divests Coalition’s referendum calling on the University to divest from multinational corporations that profit from the military occupation of the West Bank and the blockade of the Gaza Strip. As one of the few (or maybe only) Palestinian undergraduates on campus, my involvement stems from personal experiences above all else. I have waited at Israeli-administered military checkpoints to travel throughout the West Bank: to get to Ramallah, from Ramallah to Bethlehem, and then crossing the border from Bethlehem to Jerusalem for Friday prayer. But it is not the hours spent at these checkpoints that make them contemptible as much as the humiliation exacted on Palestinian civilians who wait there. People are penned close together in a winding line, waiting to approach a metal detector surrounded by two soldiers with rifles and another soldier aiming a machine gun at the next Palestinian in line. Meeting the eyes of that soldier was probably the most disconcerting moment of my life — he saw no humanity in my eyes, the object of yet another security check. And I could certainly see none in his, aiming a machine gun at my chest. Considering solely the experience at a typical West Bank checkpoint, it is no wonder that this conflict has not reached even the semblance of a solution. Forty-eight years of occupation have bred deep mistrust, scuttling hopes for a peaceful solution to the conflict. Dismantling this systematic oppression would create a space to improve relations. Divestment is a key step toward achieving this critical goal. Perhaps the most antagonizing element of the occupation that I have witnessed is the constant Israeli patrol over Palestinian villages, aided by tools of discriminatory surveillance from which the referendum seeks to divest. A sniper tower stands at the outskirts of my grandparents’ village guarding a settlement highway that only Israelis—not Palestinians—are permitted to use, threatening anyone who comes close to it. A tank rides through the village regularly, backing up when children chase it and fling whatever rocks they could find at it. Once, when a group of teenagers were throwing rocks at the tank as it rolled down our street, they were blasted with a stun grenade. Coming from suburban New Jersey, I thought it was a bomb. Little did I know the unconventional tools of occupation. I’ve known the occupation all too well, and I know that no Princeton student would support the repression it breeds. I speak here only to give perspective on an issue that has thus far been treated as a political debate and a set of statistics on this campus. The occupation of the West Bank is more than that. It is not the answer to Israel’s security concerns, nor does it make a peaceful two-state solution possible. It, instead, is the destruction of the Palestinian economy. It is the stifling of young Palestinians’ educational and employment opportunities by restricting freedom of movement via checkpoints and an arcane permit system, rendering a commute to work or school nearly impossible. It is the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes in al-Khalil (Hebron) to make way for an imported settler family. It is the confiscation of land and olive trees. This is the Israeli military occupation that the divestment campaign hopes to bring to an end. Lina Saud is a Wilson School major from Princeton, N.J.

84128|~|A responsibility not to divest|~|   April 19 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Caroline Snowden ’17 When we signed “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities” at the beginning of our freshman year, we committed ourselves to creating a “community in which all members can participate fully and equally.” As Princetonians, we are both honored and compelled to be part of this effort for positive impact in our school, our country and the world. It is therefore imperative that, when our Princeton community is challenged to respond to a complex and divisive issue, we remember our promise. This week there will be a vote on a referendum to divest from multinational corporations involved in Israel’s military operations in the West Bank. Needless to say, the conflict in Israel is nothing if not complex. Yet the divestment referendum creates the impression that there is only room for binary judgment. It represents an attempt to make a public statement about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, using Princeton’s name to legitimize condemnation of what is termed the “collective punishment” and “state repression” of Palestinian citizens. In reality, the pro-divestment group does a disservice to peace by creating false dichotomies. The concern for basic human rights is important, and it definitely deserves our attention. The present situation in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank is undeniably heart-wrenching. Compassionate people cannot fail to be moved by the devastating violence that fills newspaper images; rational individuals cannot condone hunger or fear. It is not only appropriate but also essential that we feel a desire and a responsibility to end the conflict that has caused misery for so many years. In the grip of such powerful and basic emotions, it is tempting to see the solutions to such conflicts as equally clear-cut. When considering those who suffer in this war, however, such oversimplification is a dangerous trap. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has affected lives throughout the entire region, drawing upon generations of religious and cultural hatred to fuel acts of violence against both parties. Palestinian citizens live in a well-documented state of chaos, but Israeli citizens must conduct their daily business as missiles rain upon their country and terrorists detonate explosives in their streets, buses and marketplaces. In 2014, Israel was criticized for bombing a UN school in Gaza, but many failed to mention that the UN found Hamas missiles stored in three different schools. While the divestment group references the demolition of Palestinian homes, it neglects to mention the tunnels constructed in order to attack Israeli residential communities on one of their holiest religious holidays. The language and mission of the divestment referendum suggests that one must choose to support the oppressed or side with the oppressor. In this situation, divestment from certain Israeli and American businesses is equated with opposition to Palestinian suffering. Divestment supporters argue that divestment “should not be controversial,” pointing to their 500 signatures on a related petition obtained in January as proof of such fact. However, the 1,000 signatures collected against divestment in January reveal a different truth: that this conflict is far from clear-cut, and to suggest otherwise would be both impractical and dishonest. Some still might argue that action, any action, in the face of suffering is superior to inaction. But what is the action of divestment intended to accomplish? Ultimately, this referendum serves little humanitarian purpose. Its economic impact is unlikely to be felt, since this situation does not meet Princeton’s pre-existing criteria for divestment. This referendum does not forward reconciliation and resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, since organizations like Tigers Together are already leading campus efforts to engage both parties in dialogue. In many ways, this referendum undermines the campus atmosphere of tolerance and collaboration that is essential for positive change. Divestment is an assertion that two-party discussion is over, that we want to end relations with one of the two sides to this story. In the debate on divestment, we do, as divestment supporters have suggested, have an opportunity as Princeton students to send an important message. What message will that be? Will it be obstruction: Princeton has determined that open debate is no longer practical or worthwhile? Or will it be a message of cooperation and understanding? At the beginning of our freshman year, we made a promise to ourselves and to this university. We promised to create and maintain a community that seeks to resolve complex problems with both respect and openness to diverse perspectives. It is clear that we are therefore honor-bound to vote “No” to divestment, reasserting our commitment to forwarding positive change both in our community and in the world.|~|Caroline is a sophomore from Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.

84057|~|Editorial: Eisgruber and hate speech|~|   April 16 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Princeton is not perfect. We have persistent problems with race, gender and class that affect members of our student body every day. Far too often, it falls upon the most affected groups to work alone to combat these problems. The fact that the University shares this dynamic with the rest of society does not make the situation excusable. We can do better, and we should do better. Being in the service of a righteous cause, however, does not exempt activists from criticism. We, the Editorial Board, disapprove of the misconstrual of the words of University President Eisgruber ’83 during the protest at the Chapel on Sunday and commend Eisgruber for his thoughtful response to the discussion surrounding Urban Congo and Big Sean. The protesters on Sunday willfully chose to misinterpret Eisgruber’s statement that “the controversies [comedy, satire and state performances] provoke may be genuinely painful, but they are also fundamental to the life of any great University.” One protester held a sign with the phrase “[Racism] is also fundamental to the life of any great University” and several others (including those who penned the manifesto) referenced the quote using the same reading. The protesters read the quote in this way out of a misguided belief that Eisgruber meant this to say that performances such as the one by Urban Congo are essential to the well-being of the University. However, the previous line of the email, which reads “Comedy, satire, and stage performances inevitably transgress boundaries,” reveals this is not the case. Performances such as the one by Urban Congo are in extremely poor taste, and Eisgruber’s own email quotes a group member describing them as “inexcusably offensive.” The protesters are right that hate speech and vitriol are not part of a thriving University. Rather, it is the discussion of the boundaries they cross that is essential to our University. It is important for us, both as thinkers and as members of society, to engage in such discourse, which is precisely what Eisgruber references in his email. We believe that discussions about what constitutes hate speech are important and productive. Furthermore, the protesters’ logic is suspect. In labeling discussion about what constitutes hate speech as itself hateful, they assume a resolution to that discussion that does not exist. Their flagrant misquoting of Eisgruber’s response is intellectually dishonest because it refuses to engage in the relevant question of what should and should not be labeled as hate speech. The protesters are eager to call a class of speech they detest hateful, but they give no way for us to adjudicate what is and is not hate speech. While their discussion is rooted in the need to protect vulnerable students, they ignore the long history of hate speech codes being used to protect the powerful from the powerless. Saying that we reject hate speech is the easy part of this argument, but the hard part is defining what we reject. While the Urban Congo performance was clearly tasteless, there is often a blurry line between acceptable artistic expression and offensive speech, as illustrated by the mixed response to Big Sean headlining Lawnparties. Activism is an important tool for advancing ideas, and it finds an important home in our protections for free speech. However, activism is not immune from criticism and, in this case, we think that the protesters misconstrued what was a commendable response from Eisgruber. Hate speech has no place in our society, and it has no place in our University; however, conversations about what hate speech is and what we should do about it are important and vital to any community. These conversations can be painful and uncomfortable, but they are necessary if we are ever to make progress towards resolving social issues of our time. We, the Board, have always believed that only through open and fair discussion of our problems can we join together to solve them. We commend Eisgruber for his thoughtful response reminding us of that need.|~|Andrew Tsukamoto ’15 and Jill Wilkowski ’15 abstained from this editorial.

83981|~|Divestment and Egypt|~|   April 16 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|An Egyptian-American activist, Mohamed Soltan, was recently sentenced to life in prison by an Egyptian court. His sin? Participating in a sit-in in protest of the 2013 ousting of Mohamed Morsi, the first democratically elected president of Egypt in over thirty years, by a violent military coup that left thousands dead. As Egyptian-Americans, the idea of our government arresting any one of us for engaging in peaceful acts of dissent is despicable. We believe we have a strong moral duty to denounce, just as Soltan did, actions undertaken by the Egyptian government that violate human rights or contravene international law. For 8 years, the Egyptian government has enforced an illegal blockade of the Gaza strip that has systematically denied Palestinians their basic human rights in Gaza. Although Egypt only shares a 12-kilometer border with Gaza, it has, along with Israel,  implemented a system of collective punishment through domination of Gaza’s air, sea, and land borders. There has been no indication of any easing of the blockade, and tensions have only recently increased. In the fall of 2014, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi razed over 800 homes and displaced 10,000 people in Rafah, a Palestinian border town, to create a “buffer” zone between Egypt and Gaza. El-Sisi justified this action under the pretense of a string of terror attacks on military targets in the Sinai peninsula. However, this claim fails to hold up to careful scrutiny. The rising force of militants in the region comes directly from the exclusion of Bedouins and other Arabs in the Sinai from participation in the economic development of the region after the Camp David Accords of 1979. As the head of Amnesty International said, “[the buffer zone] is not a solution to growing militancy in the Sinai region as it does not address the roots of the problem.” Such actions are representative of the collective punishments inflicted regularly against civilian populations in Gaza for the actions of a few, and el-Sisi’s pretext not only continues the depiction of Palestinian life as worthless, but also places relations between Egypt and Gaza at an all-time low. Furthermore, in the past year alone, el-Sisi has closed the Rafah Crossing, the Egyptian border with Gaza, multiple times. As a result, trade in Gaza and people seeking asylum face more and more challenges. The Rafah Crossing is absolutely essential for allowing food, materials and other supplies into Gaza. Its closing only facilitates and amplifies the crippling effect of the blockade on Gaza. Trade becomes stifled, while asylum seekers may find themselves stuck in Gaza for months at a time. These are only the most recent examples of a long history of Egyptian persecution against the Palestinian people. El-Sisi has continued the herding of Palestinians into overcrowded and unsanitary refugee camps, limited the number of Palestinian immigrants into Egypt, and has continued the legacy of his predecessor, Hosni Mubarak, in working with Israel to maintain what various human rights organizations such as B’tselem have called the “largest open air prison in the world.” The siege imposed on Gaza by Israel can only last with Egyptian support, and our government has refused to change its destructive policies towards the people in Gaza. Its continued devotion to the blockade stifles the development of infrastructure and economic stability in Gaza, two crucial elements required to ensure the self-determination of the Palestinian people. It is with these crimes in mind that we feel compelled to denounce the actions of the Egyptian government. The sad state of Egyptian politics is that Egyptians today have very little freedom to criticize and challenge the policies of their government. As such, it often falls on expatriate Egyptians living abroad to bring these issues into the public eye and speak for those who cannot. As such, we must support divestment from corporations that profit from the illegal blockade of Gaza. The continued dehumanization of Palestinians by any government, including Egypt’s, is wrong, but especially in the face of injustices perpetrated by our government, we are moved to speak out. Divestment represents the best non-violent solution to this humanitarian crisis and the most compelling action we can take as students. It is our obligation as Egyptian-Americans, and more importantly as human beings, to support divestment. We feel a personal connection to the pain of Palestinians in Gaza because our countrymen are directly responsible for their suffering. To dismiss these atrocities in the name of nationalism, or to disparage divestment movements such as this one as anti-Egypt or targeting Egypt unfairly, in the way many have attempted to paint it as anti-Israeli or unfairly targeting Israel, is a moral obscenity. This line of reasoning is disingenuous and intellectually bankrupt. The call to divest is a moral imperative, and in particular for all those whose countries participate in the oppression of the Palestinian people. This divestment movement calls for companies to end their complicity in human rights violations in the West Bank or Gaza. The onus to support divestment falls on all Princetonians whose university profits from the suffering of the Palestinian people, and we call on those who have roots to either Egypt or Israel to lead this call.

83979|~|Informed dissent is not racism|~|   April 16 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|Initially, I did not understand the rage in response to Urban Congo. I was indifferent to the performance and found it nothing more than slightly amusing. This reaction arguably occurred for many reasons, not least of which is the fact that I am not a minority. However, once the extent of the backlash became apparent, I was very interested in learning exactly what the issue was and, more importantly, why it warranted such extreme action against the offending parties. So naturally, I tried engaging the offended parties seeking clarification on the issue. The response I received was perhaps the least productive and least convincing discourse I have ever encountered. It’s no secret that most of the discussion regarding Urban Congo unfolded on Facebook, so naturally this was the forum for much of my debate. After reading an overt censure of the student body and a public outcry against the high emotional toll minority students must pay at this school, a friend and I decided to push back. A polite rebuttal and request for clarification quickly devolved into a heated discussion on race and cultural appropriation. I fully expected an exhaustive debate given the complexity and deep-rooted emotions surrounding the issue. Yet, almost immediately my criticisms were dismissed and belittled because of my (purported lack of) race and so called ignorance regarding the issue. There was a disturbingly common willingness of people to dismiss intellectual arguments and to gawk and insult dissenters for even questioning the validity of their response. Even asking for simple clarification was marked as disrespectful because somehow, the onus of proving their points was placed on me, and I was insulted for not researching their opinions enough. Here are a few select quotes from the discussion, all receiving substantial “likes” and support. “But the thing is this: Why do we need to explain why this is wrong?” “You have Princeton students from Cameroon, Nigeria and Ghana speaking about their disgust. They shouldn’t have to assert anything.” “You are not a minority. You don’t have a poker chip in this game.” And my personal favorite, “No, *****, there does NOT need to be a “formal discourse” whenever someone is offended. Are you kidding me? That is absurd. Who needs this “formal discourse”? The default response seems to be zealous rhetoric and spiteful criticisms. The prevailing emotions are anger and contempt. Worst of all is the assumption that any sort of dissent, no matter how respectful, is fueled by covert racism or a malicious intention. For the record, I do not doubt that many people were offended by Urban Congo. Clearly that’s not up for debate. However, it seems that those offended think that simply stating that minority students have been offended is a universally acceptable justification for any demands the offended parties have, including the absurd mandate of expelling those students involved with Urban Congo. Certainly, offense and suffering is a net negative on society that I am entirely in favor of eliminating. But simply stating that you are offended does not afford you the right to make demands on other’s behaviors and lives. This requires further justification. Here is an analogy to flip the tables. There are many members of the religious right who find gay marriage appallingly offensive. Does this mean that devout Christians who are offended by gay rights can demand that the gay community curb their behavior simply on the grounds that it is offensive? Does this mean they do not have to justify their offense? Certainly not. The religious right doesn’t have a logical justification for restricting marriage to only a man and a woman, and I’m very ready and willing to offer a strong defense of why marriage is most fair when applied equally to any sexual orientation. Of course, the threshold for justifying offense is far greater in the case of gay marriage because it affects the course of people’s entire lives, whereas disbanding a comedy troupe probably won’t make much difference in the long run. But the point is fundamentally the same. Just because you are offended does not inherently mean that my actions are wrong. I entered into a discussion ready and willing to change my opinions if sufficient justification was offered. Instead, I was dismissed because of my race and insulted because my opinion did not align with an absurdly overhyped narrative. Now, I’m not standing here asking for sympathy for being white. Many would be quick to point out that I certainly don’t need sympathy, and I completely agree. I’m simply acknowledging the fact that fighting discrimination with discrimination is counterproductive, not to mention ironically hypocritical. Take it from somebody who has a differing opinion: I’m far less willing to take the issue seriously now if what I heard is the extent of justification that exists on the other side. The uproar surrounding Urban Congo has clearly not been fruitless. At the very least, it has gotten me to reflect quite a bit on the issue of race and culture. But it has failed entirely at generating sympathy and gathering support from the very audience it alienated — the would-be dissenters and people who were genuinely interested in exploring the many facets of the issue. I applaud the administration and their recent espousal of open discourse and free speech regardless of its offensive nature or apparent political incorrectness. And yet, how was the administration’s attempt to mitigate constructive discourse met? Oh, that’s right, with open protest to University President Eisgruber ’83 in the midst of the Chapel meeting held explicitly to address the concerns of the offended parties. Many opinions may indeed be disrespectful, insensitive, misinformed or worse. I am very willing to accept that my opinions may be profoundly ignorant. However, if you refuse to engage me and instead choose to dismiss my opinions because of my race (or lack thereof), how can you expect me to listen to yours?|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a computer science major from Pittsburgh, Pa.

83836|~|Princeton is going up in flames|~|   April 15 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|At least, someone who isn’t affiliated with the University, scouring Yik Yak or recent press coverage, would think this. Whether it is student government, student groups or student life, everyone has been constantly asking themselves: who’s at fault, who’s not, to sign or not to sign the next petition — can we do anything right anymore without taking, or giving, offense? The answer is a resounding no. However, the problem lies not in the fact that people can be offended, but that everyone is now offended, even offended that those who are truly offended call them out for offending them in the first place. But this self-victimization stems from a much larger, innate problem — we do not take criticism well, and above all, we cannot fathom criticizing ourselves. Naturally, it’s so much easier to shift the blame onto anyone else but yourself in a desperate, subconscious attempt to exonerate yourself. It is this aversion towards, and ensuing evasion of, criticism that feeds into a fear of criticism, and that, in turn, has contributed to this surge in controversy on campus and precludes any resolution. Let’s revisit the email President Eisgruber sent out to the University last week, essentially sanctifying the freedom of expression on campus, condemning social media and championing “further constructive engagement.” Fast-forward to last Sunday, when instead of a constructive discussion that acknowledged faults and flaws, they attempted to have the “choir performance at chapel event [sing] systemic marginalization away.” Apart from the handful of audacious students protesting the chapel gathering, many, including The Star Ledger’s Paul Mulshine, have pointed out that the event consisted of politically correct statements interspersed with musical performances (no, not from Urban Congo). Why didn’t more students protest the event, or at the least, speak up? Why did many students choose to casually criticize the email that was sent out from behind our computer screens? Why did so many of us prefer to scroll absent-mindedly through Yik Yak and observe the debate on social media from the sidelines? We feared criticism. We fear criticism because we ultimately fear that the issue at hand – the blame – will come back to us. If we set out to criticize school administration and faculty for being passive and politically correct, then we will end up in sharing that blame. We will realize that so many of us — myself included — have been complacent and even politically correct, much like the administration we seek to denounce. And that criticism will lead to a realization of hypocrisy. This fear has shown its colors in the recent debate over protecting the freedom of expression on campus and regulating it. On one hand, the majority of us remain wary of publicly denouncing “freedom of expression,” compared to a minority who protested that hate speech does not qualify as free speech. We are fully cognizant of the fact that such performative caricatures, as depicted by Urban Congo, are disgusting and undesired. However, at the same time, we are afraid of opening the door to that possibility that “freedom of expression” has limits. We are internalizing fears that one day we might be called out on what we say or do when what we say may be controversial and we try to champion such a freedom. On the other hand, many of us remain wary of publicly denouncing the regulation of speech and expression on this campus. As undeniably offensive as performances by a group like Urban Congo were, in reality we bear no constitutional right to not being offended, and we realize that we shouldn’t be aiming to sanitize our campus. However, in adopting that opinion, we fear being associated with the very people that other students have so vehemently criticized and singled out. Likewise, the petition to rescind Big Sean’s offer to perform at Lawnparties, due to his history of sexual assault and misogynistic and demeaning lyrics, demonstrates this fear of criticism. Undeniably, many of us are disconcerted by his history, if not his lyrics. However, we permit that discomfort to be overcome by fear — the fear that even if we criticize USG’s decision to bring Big Sean to campus, we all still plan on attending Lawnparties, and above all, his performance. Even if a cohort of activist students decides to boycott Lawnparties, many of us, if not most of us, will still find ourselves listening to to Big Sean on stage less than a month from now. If we criticize the choices USG has made with other equally racist, sexist and/or derogatory Lawnparties musical performers and acts that we have paid for, we will realize how much the entire concept and culture of “Lawnparties” is perverted. Yet, to admit that requires us to admit that the very thing that we enjoy, that we anticipate and that we hype is wrong. We should all take a step back from the controversies on campus and look at and within ourselves first. Emphasizing the importance of introspection and the willingness to embrace criticism may be, in fact, preaching to the choir. I admit — it is not easy to realize just how much we, ourselves, are to blame. But in order to reach a consensus and a solution to these issues, we need to point fingers at ourselves. Regardless of whether you consider yourself the “victim” or the “transgressor” in any of these situations, none of us are beyond reproach.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

83828|~|Free to hate|~|   April 15 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Steve Swanson|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|What does “free speech” mean? Recent campus events have shown that campus is split: columnist Newby Parton writes without qualification that “silencing offensive speech… solves nothing that can’t be solved by growing thicker skin,” while students protest the chapel meeting with signs lambasting the administration’s weak response to Urban Congo and claiming that President Eisgruber wrote, “[Racism] may not be suppressed.” These events, as well as the mixed responses to the University’s new statement on academic freedom, demonstrate that students have very different conceptions of free speech. The two sides of this campus debate basically fall in line with the two competing theories of free speech on the world stage. The first of these is laid out in the First Amendment to the US Constitution and expounded by several Supreme Court cases. Under this model, speech (and, more broadly, “expression”) can be restricted only for its time, place or manner; if it is libelous or slanderous; or if it is a direct incitement to violence. The second theory of free speech is one to which much of Europe subscribes, and to which American college campuses have been attracted recently. While affirming the value of the liberty to express ideas, subscribers to this theory hold that speech need not be directly physically harmful for its content to be restricted: for instance, Denmark punishes speech “threatening, insulting or degrading a group of persons on account of their race, national or ethnic origin or belief.” Similarly, Princeton’s current policies allow sanctions for speech that “demeans” or “intimidates” others. It is not immediately obvious which of these understandings of free speech is the right one, especially since we are dealing with a college campus, not a government — the question of constitutionality has no bearing. The European model is based on a broader construction of harm, understanding that speech doesn’t need to directly incite people to physical violence in order to be harmful. As research has looked deeper into the psychological effects of speech, it has become clearer that “sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me” is not strictly true: researchers have described hate speech’s effects as “injurious” and even “traumatic.” In light of this, Parton’s above exhortation to grow a “thicker skin” seems woefully inadequate. If speech can be so harmful, causing deep psychological damage and perpetuating negative stereotypes, the banning of certain malicious speech in European countries and on college campuses seems reasonable. However, this comes with some serious problems. First, the definition of psychological harm remains elusive. Whereas physical injuries can be catalogued objectively, psychological injuries rely on self-assessment or the work of psychiatrists, whose diagnoses can be difficult to understand or subjective. A broken nose is much easier to prove and quantify than a feeling of inadequacy. Without such evidence of harm, accusations of demeaning speech become difficult if not impossible to verify. Second, the “impact over intention” doctrine that has been espoused in response to the Urban Congo incident is unhelpful for ascribing blame. Establishing that a psychological injury has occurred gives no indication of who committed the wrong: certainly the user of a racial slur is to blame for the impact that causes, but who is to blame for the incidental impact of a conversation about affirmative action (as occurred when preceptor Russell Nieli was accused of racism)? If a conservative Christian feels demeaned by pro-gay marriage speech, should that speaker be shut down? The final issue with any ban on speech is that it is ineffective for achieving social change. Suppressing undesirable speech won’t suppress undesirable opinions; the best way to defeat these opinions is to meet them head on and demonstrate their wrongness. Law or campus regulations only have the power to change people’s behavior, not their beliefs: would we rather scare racists into silence or eliminate racism? While laws can do the former, only speech can do the latter. The First Amendment understanding of free speech answers these problems with the European model. Yes, narrowly constructing harm to include only the physical hampers the government’s ability to protect its people’s psychological well-being, but it also eliminates the problems of quantifying psychological damage and ascribing blame for such damage. While it is disconcerting that this construction protects KKK rallies and Neo-Nazi marches, it is only by allowing all speech that wrong opinions can be overcome in a true marketplace of ideas, rather than simply pushed underground. It is this marketplace of ideas, not any restriction of free speech, that has caused America’s undeniable progress away from racism and sexism in the last half-century. This understanding of free speech is better not only for a government, but also for an institution like our own. Princeton students, in theory, are smart enough and critical enough to handle a marketplace of competing ideas, and the existence of such a marketplace is a crucial component of the college experience. Suppression of harmful ideas on campus not only fails to prepare students for an outside world without this suppression, but also fails to ensure that students believe what they believe for good reason. Of course, this doesn’t mean that students harmed by others have no recourse except for a thicker skin: if Urban Congo offended you, tell them why; tell other students why they’re wrong; ask your classmates to boycott or condemn the show. Use your free speech against theirs. Change the attitudes of your classmates; don’t police their behavior.|~|Steve Swanson is a Computer Science major from Vienna, Va.

83832|~|Defending dissenters, a case for political correctness|~|   April 15 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|In the aftermath of the Urban Congo fiasco and the Big Sean controversy, many of my fellow students have expressed disdain of a perceived boom of liberal sensitivity and outspokenness. It is true that our campus has become more divided, and somewhat chaotic. Since we’ve recently acquired the tenacity to cite names in public forums, I too feel less inhibited to be forthright in addressing a deplorable statement made by Julius Dixon ’16 on Facebook. Given the public status’ incredible response — receiving over 400 likes before it was removed by its author — it would not be too presumptuous of me to assume the reader is aware of it. For those who are not familiar, and for a reminder, the 264-word post commanded “Butthurt Princeton students” to stop over-policing perceived political incorrectness, and instructed members of our community to either stop being offended or stop voicing their offense. The reason why I speak out now is not solely to berate Mr. Dixon, but primarily to address the student body at large, particularly those 400 likely well-intentioned, though empathetically-challenged peers who were so moved as to support his status with a like or an occasional “AMEN” comment. There were several issues within his statement, making it all the more worrying that so many students seem to endorse it. First, it is a complete logical fallacy for the author to call for an end to voicing complaints, when he exercised the right to express his own discomfort through the posting of his tirade. How would we have imagined that the constant discomfort of others could be so incredibly trying for Mr. Dixon, and how could we possibly be considerate towards him in that regard, by learning to “deal with our own lives,” had he not publicly aired his opinion? Secondly, and more importantly, the statements were entirely dismissive, redirecting the duty of mindfulness back onto those who reveal problematic actions in the first place. I understand that most students here propose to be moderate, removed from the Big Sean and Urban Congo debate, and as recent offenses have grown more salient and the battle between offenders and accusers grown more vitriolic, the “moderate” students sought a less confrontational voice to align with their indifference. Unfortunately, Dixon and the 400 supporters likely misinterpreted his message as more reasonable or relaxing than it came off. While under the guise of clearing the air, his comments did nothing more than exacerbate an already apathetic campus culture, stifle societal progress and undermine the very spirit of democracy in our community. College is a place to become educated both academically and socially; this includes learning how peoples’ lives are different than our own, and how language and actions can be, unbeknownst to us, tools of oppression. We learn that there is no default disposition; what offends Dixon may not offend me, but that does not delegitimize his concern. Dixon and the 400 needn’t “walk around on eggshells trying not to say the wrong thing.” Sometimes you have to speak out to learn what is right and wrong. But when people demonstrate their disapproval or seek to educate you on their perspective, don’t be so defensive as to silence them. Is protecting your self-image more important than someone else’s feeling accepted in their identity? What compels you to censor yourself is your sense of morality, to which all humans must oblige. You don’t always have to agree with critiques, but at least have the decency to appreciate their forthrightness and perhaps try to understand how your actions can be perceived as problematic or harmful. So the first level of a healthy community dialogue is the ability to voice oneself, a right that should be particularly protected for social critics. But does that then condone Urban Congo’s free speech or the spiteful comments against people like Joanna Anyanwu ’15? As I see it, the second level of this system is compassion. To claim superiority implicitly or explicitly, engage in hate speech or marginalize a subset of people based on characteristics they cannot control, for nothing more than comfort and entertainment, is the antithesis of compassion. Finally, for those who deal in reason, the third level is simply correctness: not political correctness, but correctness of fact. Are we not educated? Do we not value being informed? If someone perpetuates an idea that is inherently incorrect, or stems from a baseless ideological framework, should we not allow a voice of correction? Within this framework, you can say or do whatever you want, but expect swift redress when your comments are both morally wrong (in relation to another person), and objectively wrong (in relation to a simple Google search or your standard encyclopedia). Oftentimes, due to our own limited knowledge and experience, we must humbly entrust others to highlight these wrongs. To make a black student feel that he is not valued as a human being, or a woman feel objectified, is morally wrong. To excuse Congo as a style of drumming, or claim that Big Sean’s lyrics are not disparaging to women is literally wrong. We should be compassionate enough to respects our peers’ complaints on the first premise, and if not that, then educated enough to regard them on the second. The formula is simple: eschew misconceptions, particularly the offensive variety. Be wary of what is offensive, especially if it is also untrue. In my opinion, conjunction of these two types of wrongs, morally and factually, transforms “free speech” into something holistically offensive, and to attempt to silence those who cry foul would be a gross misunderstanding of who has misspoken. So Julius Dixon, I thank you for removing your status, at the bequest of fellow students, and I entrust that you and those 400+ Princetonians in fact do not condone the trading of truth for comfort, or empathy for entertainment. As both gentlemen and scholars, or gentlewomen and scholars, we are better than this.|~|Kovey Coles is a Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs major from Fork Union, Va.

83677|~|Adjusting Our Mindset: Prioritizing meaningful service matters at Princeton|~|   April 14 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|We would like to thank columnist Reva Abrol for her recent article, “A vicious cycle of weak civic engagement,” published last month. Her article brings an important issue to light: here at Princeton, and on many elite college campuses, the immense value of service is not entirely visible. To Reva, and to Princetonians who nodded their heads as they read her article, we say: we sympathize with your experience. We too expect better, both from ourselves and from the institution by which we are all linked. We, too, know that this must change. This op-ed, in conjunction with Reva’s article, seeks to engage in a dialogue about the culture of overachievement that reigns supreme at the University: on a campus where time is the most valuable currency, service is often not considered a top priority. This represents a loss of our most essential values as an educational institution, particularly one that strives to be “in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations.” Although we cannot add more hours to our days, we can adjust our community mindset so that students are more likely to allocate their time to genuine, well-informed service endeavors. The first step in shifting the University’s mindset and prioritizing service is to recognize some of the meaningful service that is already happening on our campus and some of the dedicated students, faculty, and organizations that are making it happen. By highlighting these instances, we learn from our peers about what it means to serve and serve well and how we can cultivate a campus atmosphere that encourages more students to prioritize and think about service in this way. For example, one of the Pace Center’s Student Volunteers Council projects, ESL El Centro, provides free English language classes five days a week to adult Spanish speakers at a community center in Trenton. Project leader Ryan Miller ’17, recounts the story of one student: “He took classes for two and a half years through El Centro. After graduating from the program, he earned his GED and now plans to enroll at Mercer County Community College.” Another SVC project, the College Counseling Project, pairs Princeton freshmen with local underserved high school juniors and seniors and supports them through the college application process. One of CCP’s high school senior mentees — a first-generation college student and first-generation American citizen — was just accepted to six colleges. Community House, a Pace Center program that works with families to close the achievement gap in Princeton, has recently started the Family Dinner series, which has had great success in bringing families together to support children’s social-emotional wellness and academic success. The Community House families, CCP mentees, and El Centro students are just a few examples of real communities and people who have been deeply affected by student service work with the Pace Center. As the student leaders at the Pace Center, we hope to transform this dialogue into an opportunity to change students’ views on civic service as we address cultural and social issues prevalent on our campus and beyond. We know more can be done. We want to let the student body know our doors are open. We urge you to check out the Pace Center’s Stories of Service campaign, which profiles Pace student volunteers and the projects they are passionate about. Come talk to us during the Pace Council for Civic Values’ office hours to find a place on campus to discover your passion for service. These new Pace endeavors are designed to shift community values, reward and publicize meaningful service and encourage more students to serve. Service also plays an elevated role in the University’s ongoing strategic planning efforts, and the Pace Center is embarking on new initiatives that focus on exploring motivations for service and emphasizing what makes service meaningful and what we learn from it. The landscape of service at the University is changing rapidly, and we are excited to see what the future may hold. Whether you are a freshman who participated in Community Action and feel too busy to continue volunteering or you’ve never set foot inside the Pace offices, know that there is something we offer for absolutely everyone on this campus and that the Pace Center adapts and thrives due to the dedication of individuals. In some ways, it is up to the University’s administration and the Pace Center to promote service, but it is up to us to prioritize it — to demand service opportunities and to seek them out in our education and in our lives. So join an SVC project. Dream up a Breakout trip. Reach out to us with your thoughts and your ideas. Your lifelong commitment to service begins now.

83675|~|Bearing the educational burden|~|   April 14 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|By now, almost all of those reading this will have seen University President Eisgruber ’83’s campus-wide email regarding the recent social media explosions of former student group Urban Congo’s performance last week and of the student-led protest of rapper Big Sean’s upcoming Lawnparties appearance. Reactions to the email, naturally, have been wide-ranging. Many students took issue with the conflation of anger over Big Sean’s performance and anger over Urban Congo’s performance, pointing out that the two issues are so disparate that the email almost smacks of laziness. Some have also complained that the “objective” tone of the email gives legitimacy to those complaining about and publicly shaming students who have stated that they feel unsafe on campus. This, they would argue, tacitly endorses the notion that Princeton is unimpressed with the plight of students of color. Other reactions I’ve heard range from appreciation that the University actually acknowledged this issue to incredulity that people are taking Urban Congo’s performance so seriously. Personally, I think that this email may have been, as one student argued in a Facebook comment, “a very political move.” The email played it very safe, vaguely supporting the debates “fundamental to the life of any great University” that spark from these “controversies.” This kind of noncommittal move seems to assume that those within the debates are on even turf, something that is impossible when students from one side of the issue are being verbally and anonymously threatened on Yik Yak. In a debate characterized by passion and ugliness and colored by subconscious racial biases, the cool, academic tone of the email didn’t particularly help the situation at hand. However, I do think the crux of Eisgruber’s email was entirely valid. As a white student, I’m admittedly not in an entirely legitimate position to unilaterally declare what the campus should do next, but I think Eisgruber is bang on the money when he quotes a University statement affirming that “fostering the ability of members of the University community to engage in such debate and deliberation in an effective and responsible manner is an essential part of the University’s educational mission.” Here’s the thing: if we are to ensure that something like Urban Congo doesn’t happen again, we must be able to communicate to those involved in organizations like Urban Congo what, specifically, about their actions was racist. Although I believe that we all unintentionally hold some racist beliefs — conditioned by social norms to retain unconscious biases which then manifest themselves outside of our own perceptions — I really don’t think that anyone on this campus deliberately does so. Indeed, the overwhelming sentiment I’ve heard my classmates voice to those who have been most active on social media in denouncing Urban Congo is, “Why do people care so much all of a sudden?” Or, in other words, “I don’t understand why this is so offensive.” We — that is, people who do understand why this is so offensive — have to understand that the diversity in perspectives the University brings together inevitably means that some students haven’t yet become fully aware of the systemic racism that permeates our society. As someone who went through this process only a few years ago, I know it’s not easy to admit for the first time that America isn’t the kind of post-racial utopia some information outlets suggest it is. The experience of realizing that you — as a human — have socialized racial biases is a painful one in the beginning. This is why I think it’s absolutely essential that we follow Eisgruber’s urging (however watered-down it may be) to engage our peers in the kind of tough interpersonal conversations that social media apps like Yik Yak tend to squelch. Eisgruber “implore[s]” us as Princeton students “to recognize the pain being felt by some members of our community.” In these discussions, we need to ensure that assertions of “This is how I feel” take precedence over assertions of “This is how you should feel.” This kind of openness goes both ways — some students have to be open to explaining in detail the kind of pain and sadness they’re going through, and some students have to be open to receiving the delineation of that kind of pain without making snap judgments about the people rendering themselves vulnerable in front of them. Over Facebook, I’ve noticed that some students of color have referred to this education as a “burden.” It shouldn’t be up to us, they say, to personally explain to white students why their potential racial insensitivity can be so destructive. I agree with this sentiment to some extent. It’s absolutely not one student’s job, or even the job of a sizable group of students, to endure the arduous process of educating a privileged group about its privilege. However, I also believe that somebody or something needs to be able to provide that sort of education. I hate to conclude with what seems uncomfortably similar to a “Kumbaya moment,” a phrase some students have used to describe the email’s goal, but we — students who understand and are able and willing to explain why, exactly, people “care so much” about Urban Congo’s performance — need to be the impetus for changing people’s perspectives on our society. People won’t typically change their beliefs on their own – many stubbornly cling to their own parochial perspectives, as I do sometimes – and we need someone, if not absolutely everyone, to be able to provide the groundwork for that change. It may be a burden, sure, but it’s a burden that I believe all of us — not just people of one shared identity — must bear.|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

83680|~|Where is the love?: A call to action for camaraderie |~|   April 14 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Imani Thornton|~|   Contributing Columnist      |~|On a student panel I was on a few days ago, I was seated before three dozen impressionable young men, ranging from the ages of 11 to 15. After a few standard questions about college life — “What’s it like to live so far from home?” or “Do you really feel like an adult on campus?” — a young man raised his hand. He introduced himself before asking his question, “What is the sportsmanship like on campus?” At first, I was puzzled. I knew that many of the young men listening to the panel were on the lacrosse team, so I wondered if perhaps he was inquiring as to whether or not there was a great deal of support for Princeton sports teams. When we asked him to clarify his question, he said, “I mean…how do people support each other?” I exchanged glances with the other three students on the panel and all-knowing smirks crossed our faces. These smirks, unfortunately, had a haunting backstory to them, of which we were attempting to conceal from these impressionable young men. But after a moment of hesitation and encouragement to “be honest,” we answered the question. And the response was not particularly positive. As blasphemous as this may sound, it is perhaps most striking that our views on Princeton’s “sportsmanship” were negative. There are several student organizations on campus dedicated to fostering a welcoming environment for all students. Despite these groups, many students have taken notice of how their fellow students reacted to their emotions during the course of the last two weeks. No school is perfect (no, not even Princeton) and as many students and faculty may have noticed, we have a lot of work to do. Yes, it is our job as students to do this work, because who else will do it? The quite obvious example of the needed work is exemplified by the alleged “unintentionally offensive” Urban Congo. Many students responded to the former group’s incendiary acts with public outcry, ranging from Yik Yak posts to Facebook statuses. Several students even reported their sentiments to Buzzfeed. As appropriate as these responses were — indeed, Urban Congo’s latest performance, among others, managed to be a mockery of “tribal” cultures, particularly those of Africa — many students responded to the responses. Most of these ranged from subtle indifference to outright lambasting of these “complainers.” However, the number of students who had no response is perhaps the most pervasive and personally, the most unsettling. Lack of camaraderie on Princeton’s campus transcends the issues of the last couple of weeks. We sing “Old Nassau” at Pre-rade, and many students sport Princeton sweatshirts on a regular basis. Many cheered when the women’s varsity basketball team ascended ranks. But this is not all that makes camaraderie. What truly creates the atmosphere sung of in songs like “Old Nassau” is empathy for one’s fellow students. In saying this, I do not implore that all students should agree on every issue; this is not only unrealistic, but it is also discouraging of dialogue between students. However, students should not feel that their opinions — ranging from those of Big Sean’s forthcoming performance to the insensitivity of the Urban Congo performance — are unworthy of discussion. At times, this lack of camaraderie may even cause students to feel unsafe on campus. When students perceive that few of their peers understand — or even want to understand — how it feels to be a minority on campus, does this not impact how we interact with one another? Are we less likely to consider the person we pass on the sidewalk as a potential friend? Do we place anonymous Yik Yak posts with racial epithets onto the faces of the Princeton students we pass by? Do these Yaks become potential threats to us? These questions and more may have been asked by several students on campus in the past few days and indeed, such an atmosphere does not resemble one of camaraderie. Perhaps camaraderie is not what Princeton students are expecting. After all, is life outside the Orange Bubble filled with camaraderie at all? The answer is probably no, and one can look at the nightly news to confirm this. However, the status quo does not excuse us from striving for empathy among students. Constantly, we are reminded that we are future leaders and that among us walk future presidents. If we do not encourage an atmosphere of camaraderie on Princeton’s campus, what does this say about the future state of this nation and the world?|~|Imani Thornton is a freshman from Matteson, Ill.

83544|~|Home|~|   April 13 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Matthew Choi Taitano|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|What is home? According to the famous American poet Maya Angelou, it is, “the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned.” As the semester comes to a close and many students have begun to solidify their summer plans, I have repeatedly asked myself this question. Although I have already been offered an internship back at home, I find myself continuously looking at other internship programs to replace it. And talking to my friends, it appears that I am not alone. The repeated trend I hear is: “I just can’t be home the entire summer.” Why do we feel the need to replace our homes, the places where we’ve grown up for most, if not all, of our entire lives? For some students, staying home may simply be boring compared to a thrilling internship in a far off country or in the heart of a bustling metropolis like New York. However, for many, the problem stems from something deeper. After all, doesn’t home offer us a place to escape the constant questioning and competition that we are sometimes inclined to feel at a competitive school like Princeton? It appears that even outside of FitzRandolph gate, Princeton students are not able to evade this judgment. Students are afraid of the stigma that comes with being home for the entire summer. While Princeton’s employment rate is higher than most other schools, with 86.6 percent of the Class of 2013 achieving their post graduation plans six months after graduating, there are still a significant 13.4 percent of Princeton graduates who are unsatisfied with how things turn out. With this in mind, it is no wonder that many students fear looking unproductive compared to their peers who are participating in intense jobs or research over the summer. As Princeton students, we might feel that we cannot afford to waste any of our time, even if we’re on breaks. This fear becomes exacerbated for low-income first generation students. To these students, they might fear that going home would be a symbol of failure to their family. A full ride to an Ivy League school is a golden ticket, a way to escape and achieve the desired socioeconomic mobility encapsulated in the American Dream. To go back home for the summer while our peers are out in the world doing great things is to admit defeat. Furthermore, for these students, home may not be the “safe place” that Angelou was thinking of. To some, home might be a place filled with the memories of struggles and tribulations. When I went back home for winter recess, it was bittersweet. Although I was happy to see my family and friends again, I was also saddened to revisit the poor conditions to which my family has been subjected for my entire life. I couldn’t imagine having to be in a place like that again for almost four months. After being at Princeton, a place with a myriad of resources, I have become confused as to where my true home is. Is it back at my run-down house in Guam? Or my little dorm room in Wilson? College is a strange time in our lives, when we have to move from our nests and are forced to discover the world for ourselves. However, I sometimes wonder if I will ever be able to call Princeton my home. With recent events on campus involving students of color making claiming, “Princeton was never made for students like me,” I wonder where home will be throughout the rest of my years here. No matter whether I’m in Princeton, Guam or somewhere else, I feel that I cannot escape the expectations placed upon me. It’s as if I’m in this limbo state of homelessness, unable to truly feel comfortable wherever I am, and I don’t know how to feel about that. I guess all I can do is to continue my Princeton career with the hopes that I’ll be able to figure it out along the way.|~|

83550|~|Why the As I Am Campaign is important|~|   April 13 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|There is perhaps no way to accurately convey the experience of living with an eating disorder, but over the course of the past seven years the best way I have discovered to (concisely) convey the point has been to describe a pernicious “voice” that is simultaneously mine and not mine that whispers self-loathing offers of faux control into my consciousness. Eating disorders are even difficult to describe scientifically as a grouping, for they are a strange breed of disease with three distinct subsets — anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder — that manifest differently. One thing that they share, however, is the capacity to ruin lives and to generate a range of related mental and physical illnesses; anorexia specifically has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. They are borne from a whole host of factors working together, ranging from the micro level of possible genetic variations on individual chromosomes to the macro level of enormous societal pressures to achieve bodily “perfection.” Recently, USG announced the imminent launch of the As I Am Campaign, intended to “start a discussion about these topics [of nutrition, body image and eating disorders] on campus, as well as to publicize campus resources available to help.” Students were allowed to anonymously submit stories of their own online and were also invited to take part in a photo campaign intended to promote a larger dialogue. The bulk of the project has yet to be publicized, but I am hopeful for its impact for a number of reasons. For one, As I Am does not put forth lofty but unreasonable goals of eliminating the existence of eating disorders on campus altogether, however ideal that would be. By allowing information from registered dieticians in McCosh to be dissipated, however, this goal of a conversation and education can be achieved in a way that does not rely on the often-damaging reaches of the Internet and that gives support to friends and families of those suffering. Many such individuals, although well-intentioned, may take actions that might prove to be counterproductive — for instance, they might ask “Why don’t you just eat more/less?” or “Why don’t you just stop purging?” instead of simply letting their loved one know that they see them suffering and that they will support and listen to them. By generating a series of questions and answers, a more productive and supportive dialogue can commence between those suffering directly from the eating disorder and their friends, families and peers. More salient, I think, is the fact that the component from McCosh adds a counter-balance to the mainstream portrayal of eating disorders that occurs most drastically on pro-eating disorder websites and in the wider media. Some of the literature I’ve read from survivors and some of my own work that I have written during and after my own battles tend to construct a dramatic narrative that neglects the clinical precision and monotony of it all. This dramatic narrative exists, yes, because the experience is one fraught with turbulence in everyday minutiae, but I think the flip side is just as important to convey. By offering “soundbites” of experiences, alongside more objective advice from professionals, a certain balance can perhaps be struck by the As I Am campaign. This duality of emotional expressiveness and objective reality could help to further elucidate the experiences of fellow students and engender a greater understanding of what it means to be suffering from an eating disorder. Such a degree of empathy cannot be understated, because that can be the key in prompting someone to reach out and seek help. The As I Am campaign cannot solve everything, nor can it create a universal understanding. But it’s a step in the right direction, and it’s about time this step is being taken. For anyone who is suffering from an eating disorder, I encourage you to reach out to someone. Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) can be reached to make an appointment at (609) 258-3285 from 8:45 to 4:45 Monday through Friday, and After-Hours Care is offered through the Infirmary 24/7. It can be reached at (609) 258-3139. The National Eating Disorder Association also has a helpline that runs from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays. Its number is 1-800-931-2237. Its website also has links for those trying to seek outside help.|~|Both resources are also available for those seeking to help a loved one.  
83548|~|Shout loud for censorship|~|   April 13 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, or FIRE, rates universities on their commitment to free speech. Green is good, yellow is cause for concern, and Princeton earns a “Code Red.” It is the lowest score that FIRE gives. I have never actually seen the University encroach on free speech. I do not expect it will ever need to, because students are censoring speech better than the University could. Take Urban Congo. On Saturday, April 4, the group put on a performance that some people did not like. Those people shouted on social media and on these very pages of the Daily Princetonian. By Monday, April 7, the group had disbanded. I want us to take pause at its demise. The percussion group eschewed traditional instruments for objects like “wet floor” signs — that is, the kind of objects you would see in an urban environment. They juxtaposed their urban edge with the loincloths they wore, a dress far removed from the modern city. The resulting display was pleasantly anachronistic and, to some, intolerably offensive. It was not quite clear just who was supposed to be offended by the performance. A ‘Prince’ column published the next day reported that the group was “deemed inappropriate by many, citing disrespect for multiple African and Native American cultures.” If these vastly different cultures can both find offense, then Urban Congo’s performances did not target any one group in particular. Yes, “Congo” is the name of a river in Africa, but no, naming your group after a river does not constitute racism. Anthropologists say that all humans lived in Africa 60,000 years ago, so I thought that the name, like the loincloths, was a nod to a lineage we all share. This is what my ancestors would have done with a “wet floor” sign, I imagined. Maybe I was wrong about the name — as frequent readers know, I am wrong a lot. Maybe the group’s fiercest critics are correct and the “Congo” in “Urban Congo” refers to one of two African countries. If true, the percussion group borrowed from a particular culture, which has stirred up talk of “cultural appropriation.” It is a negative term whose usage spiked in 1985. Before that, the mixing of cultures in America was called the melting pot, and it was a good thing. I am not saying that Urban Congo was good. But neither was it “the heart of darkness,” as Nicolas Wu ’18 accuses in his April 7 column. He calls on the University to examine clubs more stringently before approving them, in order to suppress anything considered objectionable. The Merriam-Webster definition of “censoring,” by the way, is “to examine in order to suppress or delete anything considered objectionable.” I do not know when it became trendy to beg for censorship, but this rhetoric should stop. We must not sacrifice our own First Amendment rights to avoid offense, because folks, no one has the right not to be offended. This doesn’t mean we should be jerks. I argued in a Jan. 4 column that we should make a conscious effort to understand how others feel. I still believe that, but loving your neighbor is a personal responsibility. Silencing offensive speech, on the other hand, solves nothing that can’t be solved by growing thicker skin. I hope I am not irking the people who feel victimized by Urban Congo. I may not understand why you took offense, but I understand that you did, and I recognize that those feelings are valid. I have offered my perception of the group not to denounce you, but to show that other valid feelings exist also. Ideally, we would have resolved our different feelings with constructive dialogue. What is cultural appropriation, and why is it bad? What is art, and when is it good to blend cultures and caricatures? We did not determine the answer to these questions, and if our calls for censorship are heard, we will never be able to do so. The faculty recently updated “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities” to affirm students’ right to free speech. Now we should affirm this right for ourselves. If students sidestep dialogue and shame others into conformity, then our ability to speak freely is little more than a paper promise.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn.

83424|~|Editorial: Guaranteeing academic freedom|~|   April 12 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|A university is a stage for the clash of ideas through reasoned discourse between those of diverse points of view. Princetonians are diverse in many ways. We differ academically, politically and culturally. Diversity of thought inevitably yields disagreement. But despite our differences and deep personal investment in various debates, we pride ourselves on the ability to engage with one another and develop ideas and values through healthy participation in the University’s intellectual community. We therefore commend the University faculty and President Eisgruber’s administration for passing a motion to include a more comprehensive statement protecting freedom of expression in the University “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities,” and we strongly encourage our peer institutions to follow suit. The new statement “guarantee[s] all members of the University community the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.” The recently passed motion admirably incorporates unequivocal language from a recent report from the University of Chicago. We suggest the University go one step further and wholly replace the existing free speech code in the guidebook with the new statement. The current code bears a “red light” designation from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, due to policies that “both clearly and substantially restrict freedom of speech.” The present language allows for University sanctions against an individual whose verbal behavior “demeans” or “intimidates” another. Though respect for others’ viewpoints is absolutely necessary for constructive campus dialogue, such language is too vague. The new statement still prohibits the most harmful forms of speech that violate the law and threaten others; however, it cuts down on the potentially abusable discretion that the University currently possesses. As recent examples at other colleges demonstrate, attention to freedom of expression is as necessary now as ever. Last year, Stanford University’s Graduate Student Council first denied funding for an Anscombe Society conference on traditional sexual values and then levied an unprecedented $5,600 “security fee” in an egregious attempt to obstruct freedom academic expression (though the fee was waived after protests). Just last month, a California State Polytechnic University student was apprehended by university police after handing out flyers for animal rights outside of a designated “free speech zone.” Controversial debates, whether about police brutality, same-sex marriage or other topics, enliven our campus. It is unreasonable and intellectually dishonest to presuppose a consensus on these issues or to expect that no one’s sensitivities will be offended in the course of discussion. Reasonable, good-willed people can and often do disagree. Rather than illiberally empowering University authorities to define which subjects are open for discussion, thinkers of absolutely any opinion should be given the latitude required to make reasoned arguments with due civility. In protecting the unhindered operation of the marketplace of ideas, the University need not fear that it will cater to hateful or outrageous speech. Such expression will quickly be rebuffed by clear and respectful argumentation from those who see it for what it is and the adopted language gives the University the ability impose time, space, and manner restrictions when appropriate. Flagrantly unlawful speech is controlled under narrow exceptions to the policy that cover threats, defamation, and breaches of privacy. At the same time, Princeton students must accept that not all campus discourse will be comfortable to hear. Broad protection of academic freedom does not favor any one viewpoint in favor of promoting ever more rigorous explorations of truth and meaning. The University only stands to gain by shoring up its defense of free speech, which will help foster the intellectual growth of all Princetonians and present a strong example to other institutions. In a November 2013 editorial, we called on our community to “recommit itself to upholding the principles of free speech in accordance with the University’s broader educational mission.” We believe that the faculty’s recent vote to affirm the “University’s fundamental commitment … to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed” is an excellent step in this direction, and we applaud this important decision.|~|Jill Wilkowski ’15 abstained from this editorial.

83420|~|Interdisciplinary at the individual course level|~|   April 12 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|This year, I enrolled in the Humanities Sequence, a year-long class that seeks to examine canonical Western literature — from Homer to Virginia Woolf — in an interdisciplinary manner. The course is taught by multiple professors who each possess different areas of expertise and interests; this setting allows students to study the same work in sometimes a historical, sometimes a philosophical, and sometimes a literary manner. The Humanities Sequence has made me realize the importance of diverse perspectives. I am mindful of this as I browse the course offerings for next fall. Let me first give credit where credit is due. I do believe that the University is incredibly dedicated to providing an interdisciplinary education. Our distribution requirements attest to this. Currently, besides courses that are specifically designed to be interdisciplinary such as the Humanities Sequence and the Integrated Science Curriculum, Princeton offers many cross-designated courses that allow students to explore. We also have interdisciplinary concentrations. For example, the very popular Wilson School concentration includes aspects of economics, psychology, statistics and sociology. However, I believe that there is even more that the University can do at the level of individual classes. Courses are cross-designated because they can be considered to meet more than one disciplinary need, not because they are designed to be interdisciplinary. For example, I am currently enrolled in HIS 210: The World of Late Antiquity, which is cross-listed between the history, classics, and Hellenic studies departments. It is an incredibly enjoyable class, and I have learned a lot from it so far. However, it is not an interdisciplinary class the way the Humanities Sequence is. Rather, it’s a history class that happens to be about the Classical era in the Hellenic world. Further, while the Wilson School itself is an interdisciplinary concentration, each course under it tends to conform to one discipline. I propose that we have more individual classes that are designed to be interdisciplinary. For example, the University of Pennsylvania and Oxford University offer PPE (philosophy, politics and economics) as a major; Yale offers a similar major called EPE (ethics, politics, and economics). I believe that Princeton can offer something like this as a class. There are a lot of possibilities for a course like this. It could examine works of Herodotus, Plato, Machiavelli, Rousseau, Smith and so many more great canonical works. These great works give us plenty to think theoretically about in terms of man’s initial state and the origin of each government, which are philosophical questions, the best possible form, which is a political one, and the way market relates to state, which is an economic one. Philosophy, politics and economics affect one another. Ethics and normative judgment are always big questions to answer in politics and economics, and macroeconomics and politics are also linked. When I asked my friends for ideas on courses like this, they were able to give me multiple ideas in a short amount of time. The existing East Asian Humanities Sequence could be vamped up so that it receives the amount of University attention and funding that the Humanities Sequence does. Furthermore, a similar course can be constructed for Middle Eastern literature and Eastern European literature. Courses like this could, besides exposing student to rich literary traditions of different cultures, provide a worldlier and less Eurocentric education. There are limitless possibilities. There can be courses that think about psychology with sociology, or even neuroscience. Perhaps a course can examine mathematics in philosophy. University of Oxford offers Philosophy and Mathematics as a major because “the parallel study of these related disciplines can significantly enhance your understanding of each.” Socrates emphasizes the importance of mathematical education in “The Republic.” Some of the greatest philosophers, such as Descartes and Leibniz, were also mathematicians; in fact, the latter developed calculus independent of Newton. Philosophical thinking is deeply influenced by the development of Newtonian mechanics. This itself can be constructed into a class. I view my education here as a struggle to maintain the right balance between obtaining a focused area of expertise and the interdisciplinary knowledge to place my area of expertise in relation to other fields. Individual, interdisciplinary classes offer a low-stress, low-commitment way of thinking with multiple perspectives and would enrich our education.|~|Erica Choi is a freshman from Bronxville, N.Y.

Leaving Beijing meant leaving Yeye and Nainai and their Alzheimer’s disease and their colon cancer, and it meant leaving heritage and old roots only just rediscovered. We were annoyed because the child behind us had already started crying. I needed to finish a column for a newspaper. The old man on my other side was very nice. At least we thought he was an old man — we talked to him later, as the plane started to descend to Newark. He was only a dad. His oldest daughter had just gotten into Columbia for engineering. “Are you guys in high school?” he asked. “No, I’m in college.” “Where do you go?” I paused for a couple of seconds. “Princeton.” He paused for a couple of seconds with his head cocked at me before he belted out, “That’s amazing!” I shrunk a little into my seat, especially under the sudden glances of other passengers (many sleepy-eyed). He immediately asked me what I had done in high school and what I was doing at Princeton now and what did I want to major in? And also, what do I want to do in life? We had good conversation; eventually he asked me for my email — for his younger daughter, who was still in high school. We talked until the plane landed and I wondered if being associated with the name of Princeton had taught me anything. Fast forward to my first time experiencing hibachi — Japanese barbecue — in a distant state. We all sat at a large table; six of us, three of them. “Them” was a middle-aged mother who was still very blonde, her 12-year-old daughter and her daughter’s friend. She asked us if we were on vacation. Yes, we were. She asked if we were college students. Yes, we were. Where did we go to school? Princeton. “Oh, my God!” she cried, eyes opening wider than I would have thought possible – “Oh my God, you go to Princeton!” She clasped her chest and turned. “Girls, we are with some very smart young ladies here!” They laughed nervously. We laughed, too. As I laughed, I thought about how being associated with Princeton — being the possible participant or subject of these sorts of conversations — has taught me to notice and understand, well, differences. Allow me to elaborate. These two encounters are not unique. But they highlight the range of ways people react to “the P-bomb”, as well as the way I’ve reacted to their responses. It has shown me that the phrase “I go/went to Princeton” is many things. It can be things which have been done before and perhaps even overdone. Privileged. Pretentious. Prideful. It can also be awe-inspiring or intimidating or reverential. It could be, in other ways, endearing. We all know that it creates some sort of effect. I have certainly not experienced the full range of situations and emotions which comes with bearing the blessing — or perhaps the burden — of an Ivy League name. What have encounters like these — in my one year or so of being associated with Princeton — shown me? What effects have they already had? The topic of Princeton stereotypes and the way students are viewed by others has been discussed before. It has been discussed in this very section, with a friend of mine illuminating the socioeconomic connotations which come along with saying, “I’m a Princeton student,” and another columnist addressing the apparent inaccessibility of Ivy League institutions and students. Although the subject of these articles, elegantly called “Ivy league elitism,” is not what I am talking about here, I find it respectful and enlightening to refer back to what they have said. I find that what they have said is true, at least through my eyes. I find that being associated with Princeton has shown me how wide small differences can sometimes be. In the different walks of life I am now more able to detect subtleties and nuances; several thousand dollars can make an ocean of difference. Majoring in, say, the Wilson School, as opposed to politics, can lead to very divergent roads. Speaking a Level Two as opposed to a Level One of English can be make a difference even in Trenton. What effects have these encounters had on me? They have begun to open my mind, yes, but they have also spoken to me of the things I have to learn down this journey I’ve only just begun.|~|Lavinia Liang is a freshman from Poughkeepsie, N.Y.

83287|~|On Yik Yak, Facebook and Racism at the University|~|   April 9 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|As a recent re-adopter of Yik Yak and a (not so) proud Facebook procrastinator, I, like the rest of campus, have witnessed the explosion of social media discussion of racism on campus over the last few days. In fact, I am myself contributing “yet another Op-Ed complaining about racism,” as one angry Yak put it. However, despite the onslaught of opinions that have been voiced in light of recent events, it is a discussion worth having. One of the biggest problems in this discussion, however, has been the tendency for both sides to try to limit or delegitimize the speech of others, rather than rebut or respond to it. Declaring an argument “too offensive to be had,” rather than winning it, is as unproductive as declaring that those who claim offense at the actions of Urban Congo are “butthurt,” and everyone would do well to engage in dialogue: convince the other side, don’t silence it. I would be remiss not to acknowledge that, as someone who has never had to live under systemic race-based inequality, there is little I can substantively contribute to this discussion, compared to others who have. Yet the ease and frequency with which some members of this campus community — most of whom look like me — have dismissed legitimate claims of overt and/or structural racism in recent days embarrasses me to my core, and I feel compelled to try to counter it, if only in one short column. This dismissal of discussions of race is  by no means universal: as with many other problems, it is likely the result of a small but loud minority. Perhaps the bright spot of Yik Yak in the past few days was when an Urban Congo performer yakked what I felt was a sincere apology to the community for irresponsible and offensive behavior. Obviously, an apology can’t undo the damage of the act that was committed in the first place, but amid a stream of Yaks complaining about people complaining about racism, it was a welcome bright spot. That said, dismissing the discussion is an unproductive response that moves us nowhere — even if the “discussion” in question is a one-sided Facebook post intended to be an echo chamber for like-minded commenters to competitively agree with each other and the original poster. There are a lot of pedantic words I could use to critique this campus’s dismissal of racism. For instance, in dismissing people’s claims to offense, victimhood or injustice without hearing first their merits, one delegitimizes the potential for dialogue that is critical for progress to be achieved. Or I could say that the ease with which people have dismissed claims of injustice reflects the very position of ingrained, structured privilege they themselves hold. But I won’t do that. Instead, I’ll just say that I think it’s rude and goes contrary to the tenets of a classical liberal education. This is not to say that I think everyone has to agree with what’s said, but dismissing an argument rather than winning it or even contending with it is at best small-minded. So while it may be annoying to some to “have to” read Yik Yaks or Facebook posts about racism at Princeton, it is nothing in comparison with actually having to live under a systemically racist system — at the University or elsewhere in America. In the former case, one can simply exit Facebook or Yik Yak and move on with one’s life, no longer having to think about racism or those who point out its continued existence. We can only wish that one could simply “exit” and “move on from” racism in the same way. Our campus would be a better place if discussions of racial injustice became just that: discussions. One-sided Facebook posts aren’t real discussions. However, dismissing the substance behind them rather than grappling with it, and (dis)agreeing based on the merits of the claim, is even less a form of real discussion and treats these issues childishly. The most interesting facet of this explosion of discussion on social media was the degree to which both sides talked past each other and even advocated limiting the other side’s freedom of speech that is a bedrock of academic inquiry, rather than engage with them. If the other side is being “oversensitive,” “butthurt” or offensive, then prove your side better by responding constructively; rebut their points instead of declaring them too offensive to be spoken. The way to convince people isn’t to take away their freedom of speech, and the way to move Princeton past BuzzFeed headline articles about racism and toward a productive progression towards greater equality and acceptance isn’t to belittle your opponents or silence them — it’s to show them why they’re wrong. We would all do better, in this debate as with others, to recognize that antagonizing your opponent does nothing compared to convincing them.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

83175|~|On Steinem and Big Sean: loving sexist music as a feminist|~|   April 9 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Julia Case-Levine|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|When “Blurred Lines” was released in 2013, I found myself in the uncomfortable position of being both captivated by a catchy beat and turned off by lyrics that seemed to condone sexual assault, categorizing consent as a “blurred line.” Ironically, my mom was probably Robin Thicke’s biggest fan. (Her other favorite songs include “My Humps” and “Fergalicious.”) When I half-heartedly objected to her love of the song, she’d protest by saying, “But it’s so good!” The campus debate over backing a musician whose lyrics are satiated with overt sexism has prompted me to reflect on the dilemma I found myself in a few years ago. Does being a feminist preclude me from jamming to songs with lyrics like “I hate these blurred lines/I know you want it”? If so, I am in deep trouble. I have playlists upon playlists teeming with songs boasting questionable lyrics. And even artists not from this decade are culpable for promoting a sexist message. In The Rolling Stones’ “Under My Thumb,” Mick Jagger squeals, “The squirmin’ dog who’s just had her day/Under my thumb … The way she talks when she’s spoken to/Down to me, the change has come.” The Doors’ “You’re Lost Little Girl” is blatantly patronizing. Even The Beatles’ “Run For Your Life” describes their intent to assault a woman who defies them — “You better run for your life if you can, little girl/Hide your head in the sand little girl/Catch you with another man/That’s the end ah little girl.” What about these songs keeps me listening? Perhaps this speaks to some women-hating impulse I secretly harbor. Or maybe the answer is more simple — inured to sexist music, I have learned to tune out what I don’t want to hear. New York Magazine author Ann Friedman describes this instinct, writing, “there is a huge swath of music that I enjoy by actively disengaging with its lyrics and their political ramifications.” Being outraged is exhausting, and, seeing as we are constantly barraged by misogynistic messages, sometimes it’s easier to simply ignore them so we can enjoy a catchy song. However, something about this approach feels lazy, insufficient, and I’m hesitant to justify consuming sexism simply because sexism exists everywhere. So the question remains: In order to be a “real” feminist do I have to purge myself of these offensive songs? For some reason, I don’t think so. Perhaps this is simply a justification because I don’t want to have to stop listening to my favorite songs. But perhaps there is a constructive way to consume sexist music, as contradictory and incongruous as that might sound. Ellen Willis, The New Yorker’s first popular music critic, sheds light on how one might do this. Willis wrote about rock and roll when it was rampant with misogyny, but instead of feeling oppressed and subjugated by offensive lyrics, she found herself empowered by the music. She wrote, “Music that boldly and aggressively laid out what the singer wanted, loved, hated — as good rock ’n’ roll did — challenged me to do the same, and so, even when the content was antiwoman, antisexual, in a sense anti­human, the form encouraged my struggle for liberation.” Willis found consuming sexist music did not discourage her political and social ideologies. In fact, in some way the music provoked her to muster her own voice in response, just as boldly and aggressively. Others agree that women-hating music does not by definition lead listeners to hate women. Bustle writer Kristen Sollee debunks the myth that listening to sexist music makes individuals sexist through some sort of osmosis-like process, going as far as saying that individuals can take ownership of music by imposing their own messages on lyrics. She writes,  “Once a piece of music is released into the world, it’s my belief that each listener can imbue a work with his or her own meaning, too. That doesn’t erase the original impetus for a song, but it can change it, if only for the individual listener.” As Sollee points out, it is worth noting that we are not fed our opinions through song lyrics, but rather project onto song lyrics our preexisting opinions. Additionally, Sollee speaks to the unproductive nature of censorship, writing, “squashing artistic and creative expression through censorship laws or restrictions will not make violence against women disappear, nor will it foster a free-thinking society.” Ultimately, I appreciate that we live in a place where we question and remain critically aware of the music we listen to. I applaud the individuals that have spearheaded a movement that has prompted us to consider song lyrics and rape culture. But, like Sollee, I believe that censorship rarely begets change. Prohibiting Big Sean from performing at Lawnparties isn’t going to stop him from producing music and isn’t going to stop a sexist culture from partaking and consuming his music. Refusing individuals a platform in which to present differing and offensive views doesn’t end these opinions. Rather, it just conceals them from our privileged community. Certainly, these beliefs can still flourish elsewhere. Listening to music mindfully does not necessarily implicate us as participants in rape culture; I would go as far as saying that in consciously consuming offensive music we are extended and pushed to see what we usually get to ignore and perhaps provoked to confront our own inner inconsistencies. Some part of me is confident we can listen to sexist lyrics, push back and in doing so even solidify our commitment to equality.|~|
83291|~|Editorial: music and misogyny|~|   April 9 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Since it went live on Sunday, the petition to have Big Sean dropped as the Lawnparties main act has fueled an intense debate within the student body. The Editorial Board supports the discussion about misogyny in music and the role the campus community has in perpetuating it; however, the Board thinks that the petition’s focus on the Undergraduate Student Government should be expanded to a more holistic critique of campus culture in general. Instead of looking to blame USG president Ella Cheng ’16 and social chair Simon Wu ’17, the Board thinks that those who have signed the petition should look at the campus community and the choices that have led to his invitation, as well as the role that music with derogatory lyrics plays in our social lives. The announcement of Big Sean as the main act for Lawnparties was initially greeted very favorably. Pictures printed in The Daily Princetonian showed elated students celebrating a musical act whose music is frequently played on the radio and danced to on the Street. Given this, the Board cannot entirely fault USG for its choice. Without knowing the other options USG had, it is clear that the choice it made was intended to satisfy its mandate to bring the most popular act to campus. As the reaction to previous main acts has shown, USG is under constant pressure to find acts that are not only affordable, but also popular and well known. It is clear that Big Sean is both. It is hard to entirely fault USG for carrying out the mission to find popular artists that the students have repeatedly asked it to complete given that students have complained when past acts were not up to their standards. However, given this, the petition does force the campus community to ask some uncomfortable questions about the role of music that contains derogatory lyrics in our campus culture. Given the role that the Street plays in campus social life, an eating club regularly playing Big Sean’s music or music that is equally or more problematic on its dance floor may very well be more exclusionary than USG’s invitation for Big Sean to headline this year’s Lawnparties. The petitioners raise valid points, but we urge both those who sign the petition and those who do not to use this as an opportunity to consider the role that music with degrading lyrics plays in our own lives. The hard truth is that Big Sean does not exist in a vacuum. He is a symptom of a problem that is much larger than music, much larger than the University and much larger than each of us. Not attending Big Sean’s concert or signing a petition is easy. It can make us feel absolved of personal responsibility in showing solidarity with issues that we care about. Signing a petition or boycotting the concert may be admirable if done for the right reasons, but that alone is hardly enough. Whether you sign the petition or not, the Board encourages you to think about the role music that contains degrading or offensive themes plays in your life. What role does it play in your personal music choices? What role does it play in the parties you attend? What role does it play in the communities you are a part of? More importantly, what role should this music play in those spaces? These are hard questions, but that should not distract the campus community from answering them. Taking meaningful steps to end misogyny on campus does not happen simply by blaming the choices of USG; it happens by examining what the University community chooses to value.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of The Daily Princetonian.

83079|~|A better way than divestment|~|   April 8 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By: Elise Backman Last week, a group of students published an opinion piece supporting the Princeton Divests Coalition’s (PDC) referendum to divest from several companies that sell products used by the Israeli and Egyptian military forces in the West Bank and Gaza. PDC is correct in stating that maintaining the status quo in the region is untenable. Unfortunately, this divestment petition will worsen the situation on the ground for both Israelis and Palestinians. All Princetonians who support a sustainable two-state solution between Israel and Palestine should vote against this referendum. Divestment encourages mistrust between Israelis and Palestinians, an essential issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A 2013 poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research states that though a majority of both Palestinians and Israelis support a two-state solution, neither side trusts that the other will uphold the principles of a peace agreement. Divestment reinforces this mistrust by placing the responsibility for changing the status quo on Israel. By divesting from companies that supply equipment to the Israeli military, the referendum implicitly blames Israel alone for the current regional political realities. Though a significant power imbalance exists between Israel and Palestine, the capacity to change the status quo rests with both parties. Past evidence indicates the potential for negative consequences as a result of unilateral action from either side. Israelis took a unilateral step toward peace by withdrawing military personnel and evacuating Israeli civilians from Gaza in 2005. Following the evacuation, Hamas, deemed a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States, violently ousted the more moderate Palestinian Authority. Since then, it has exploited its own people by embedding military infrastructure in civilian areas in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and has launched rockets at Israeli civilians. This increased hostility is the result of unilateral action, which divestment supports by assuming that Israel alone is responsible for changing the status quo and ignoring past peace efforts. By blaming Israel alone, the divestment referendum also discourages Palestinian leaders from making concessions in future peace negotiations. At the same time, calls for divestment from Israel’s allies, like the United States, lend credibility to the political rhetoric of right-winged political parties in Israel, diminish the voice of moderates and encourage mistrust of international moderators. This increases the polarization of Israeli society and makes it less likely for Israel to engage in future peace talks. Divestment is consequently counterproductive to achieving a two-state solution. The divestment referendum also ignores security threats to Israelis and Palestinians, thereby worsening the status quo. It does not acknowledge the danger posed by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad or al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, which seek the destruction of Israel and kill Palestinians who collaborate with Israel. These organizations derive their legitimacy and power from setbacks to the peace process. These threats do not justify excesses by Israeli security forces or settlement construction. However, the immediate dismantling of all military infrastructure in and around the West Bank and Gaza without a peace agreement, as suggested by the divestment referendum, would pose an immediate danger to Israeli and Palestinian lives. Though we want an expedient end to Israel’s military presence in and around the West Bank and Gaza, to be successful we recognize this must come with security guarantees for both peoples. According to the The Atlantic and the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace, “Only when the question of security is satisfactorily addressed will [Israeli and Palestinian] leaders have the political capital required to resolve the remaining core issues of the conflict.” By ignoring these threats, the divestment referendum does not address the security concerns that affect the success of the two-state solution. If divestment is counterproductive, what steps can actually improve the situation in the region, and what role should Princetonians play in this process? As stated at the outset, the core problem in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship is the lack of mutual trust and credibility. Trust must be fostered through non-governmental and governmental channels. As a marketplace of ideas, Princeton can work to promote trust among Israelis and Palestinians by participating in initiatives like Tigers Together. Tigers Together fosters trust by supporting organizations that promote interdependence and development in Israel and Palestine by hiring civilians from both sides to work in four key areas: environment, leadership, healthcare and business. Tigers Together has already raised funds for crucial projects like the Good Water Neighbors initiative, which increases awareness of the shared water problems in the region. Outside of trust building through non-governmental channels, it is important to increase the mutual credibility of Israeli and Palestinian governmental agreements. According to Princeton professor and former U.S. Ambassador to Israel and Egypt Daniel Kurtzer, the U.S. government should take an active role in this process by exacting consequences for bad behaviors on both sides. For this strategy to be successful and politically feasible, these consequences must not be related to security, as advocated by the divestment referendum, or humanitarian aid.|~|We are not naïve. Like our fellow students, we are extremely concerned with the status quo that characterizes the current Israeli-Palestinian relationship. We also know that much groundwork must be laid before Israelis and Palestinians can achieve a sustainable peace. These motivations, however, should compel us to support governmental and non-governmental avenues that build trust among Israelis and Palestinians, rather than to vote in favor of a referendum that endangers the two-state solution. Over 1,000 faculty members, students and alumni recognized the dangers of divestment in the fall. There is a better way than divestment to improve the political reality for Israelis and Palestinians.

83089|~|Terrorizing while white|~|   April 8 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 who crashed it into the French Alps on March 24, has made rounds in news headlines. As fairly strong evidence emerged of his deliberate crashing of the plane, I took note of the word choice used in reports: depression, suicide, illness, stigma and treatment. These words have increased our sympathy not just for the families of the victims on board, but also for the killer himself. While his struggle with depression was clearly very upsetting, the news coverage of his mental health has been extraordinary. His signs of instability have been factored into our consciousness in complete disproportion to any other recent killer. The Boston Globe, among others, called it a suicide, but if he intentionally killed 149 innocent others along with himself, it is, in no intricate terms, murder. When Scott Roeder murdered Dr. George Tiller during a church service for performing late-term abortions, he was labeled a “murderer.” When Jim David Adkisson opened fire on the audience of a youth musical seeking to attack liberals, he was labeled a “shooter,” his most famous portrait portraying him smiling with an American flag. When Daniel McGowan set fire to the offices of Superior Lumber as a member of the Earth Liberation Front, he was labeled an “activist.” Although these three violent criminals terrorized their victims, they are killers, not terrorists. As Americans, they are angry, radical, lonely killers, yes, but terrorists they are not. Lubitz’s crime does not point to terror according to the State Department’s definition of terrorism: “Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.” As far as we know, his crime was not politically motivated. As far as we know, he was not trying to influence any kind of audience. As far as we know, he was lost and desperate and needed help. But we ought to question all that we know about him and why we know it. Lubitz searched Google in German, not Arabic, he was born in the West and ran half-marathons with his father. This 27-year-old pilot is pictured, in most of the coverage about him, with earphones and a Lufthansa-labeled runner’s bib. Let’s analyze some of the headlines so far: “Andreas Lubitz, Who Loved to Fly, Ended up on a Mysterious and Deadly Course” from The New York Times, “Germanwings Co-Pilot Andreas Lubitz Was Treated for Suicidal Tendencies” in The Wall Street Journal and even an opinion piece in the LA Times titled: “Mental illness made the Germanwings co-pilot a victim along with his passengers.” The photos paired with these stories are, respectively: Lubitz smiling peacefully at the Golden Gate Bridge, Lubitz running in a race and Lubitz running in a different race. We know him as a man who loved to fly, who loved to run, who was suffering and seeking treatment. As Gary Greenberg wrote in The New Yorker, “It is comforting to think that Lubitz was mentally ill.” Indeed. We can easily label Lubitz as an aberration, a worst case, an exception. We can easily believe another such crime will be preventable, if only Lufthansa Airlines steps up its psychiatric evaluations. But the harder question we need to ask is if Lubitz and his crime deserve an explanation that is almost sympathetic, whether or not he deserves all this careful consideration. According to the American Psychological Association, mental illness is not usually linked to crime. For news outlets to so explicitly focus coverage on his mental health status is reinforcing stigma against those suffering from depression and also distracts from the fact that although he was suicidal, he did not only take his own life. It is understandable that journalists are seeking to deconstruct a killer’s motives; it is not understandable, however, that he is getting such an unbalanced, sympathetic explanation. Why are we posthumously giving Lubitz a chance at complexity? It’s almost as if the news is trying to explain and even forgive him for his crime. If Lubitz were Arab, we might have started out calling him a terrorist; it is the deeply upsetting reality of modern journalism. I do not think Lubitz is a terrorist by definition (he lacked political motivation or intended audience of influence), but this is just another factor that highlights the special casing we seem to be giving this murder. The inconsistent accusations and attitudes about which murderers are “complicated” or “suffering” is the root of the problem: all killers are victims in some ways, too. It is not wrong to feel sympathetic for a criminal; it is wrong when news coverage that might inspire it is unfair and unequal. The problem is not sympathy, but shifting standards of sympathy inextricably tied to the skin color of the guilty. It is terrible when someone’s inner demons desire the end. But if Lubitz, an unequivocal mass murderer, gets coverage about his running hobby, former lovers and browser history, the news needs to rethink how they report, or don’t, the complexity of every killer.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

83084|~|Asking the hard questions|~|   April 8 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|This past year, the most prevalent statistic for college campuses across the country was the suicide rate — a number that has been re-calculated time and time again. In the past week alone, the LA Times, the Boston Globe and campus newspapers across the country have reported increasing rates of student suicides and the accompanying demand for more psychological services. The University and the Princeton student body have similarly voiced concerns about the culture around stress, depression and suicide on campus, along with the establishment of student organizations such as the Mental Health Initiative and the in-development Peer Connections program. It’s clear that students want to be more sensitive to this issue — after all, no one wants to be unhelpful or unsympathetic to friends who reach out for help. However, few of us are equipped to help in the correct way. Recently, I attended the Princeton Distress Awareness & Response (PDAR) workshop, hosted by Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS). Dr. Calvin Chin, Director of CPS, advised attendees about how to sensitively approach someone exhibiting signs of distress or depression. This included asking open-ended questions, taking an affirmative stance while speaking to them, being able to tolerate silence within the discussion, using and reflecting the speaker’s own descriptions of his or her depression rather than projecting our own interpretations and validating his or her emotions. However, the most surprising moment for many of us was when we were asked the question, “Should you ask if your friend has had suicidal thoughts if they’ve told you they’re depressed?” For some of us, the answer seemed intuitive. Others had never had to deal with this situation and figured that we’d know when the time came. Either way, no one was entirely sure. The answer, apparently, is yes. “It’s always best to be direct about questions such as suicide,” said Dr. Chin. “If the person has not thought about suicide, they’ll let you know and if they have thought about it, they might be relieved to finally have someone ask them the hard question.” That asking about suicide will “put that thought in their head” if it wasn’t there before is simply a misconception. Rarely do people not want to get better. Therefore, asking the hard question, regardless of what their answer is, shows that you acknowledge the seriousness of their depression and are willing to receive whatever response they give you, even if it might be an uncomfortable subject. The dialogue around mental health needs to move away from the attitude that it’s the depressed individual’s responsibility to make the subject pleasant or convenient for the listener. While the listener should prepare for the conversation and preferably consult a psychological services professional beforehand, even an inelegant discussion is better than none at all. In many circumstances, as the classmates, friends and neighbors of students who may be struggling with mental health issues, we’re the front line. We’re the first people that our friends and classmates will approach before reaching out to other resources or even their parents. We’re often the first ones to recognize signs of distress or depression in our fellow students, perhaps even before an RCA, counselor or professor. This means that it’s our societal responsibility to care about how we deal with the topic of mental health as much as being informed about and actively intervening in situations involving sexual harassment or dangerous behavior such as binge drinking. The University requires students to complete the online module AlcoholEdu before we begin classes during our freshman year and to attend orientation seminars on topics such as sexual assault, plagiarism and verbal harassment. However, there have been no early mental health awareness programs during our freshman year. For many students about to start their freshman year, the thought that the next four years could be the most emotionally trying and pressured years of their lives might not yet be on their minds. For many, freshman year is so rough because expectations don’t match reality. Therefore, introducing concepts such as mental health and the resources associated with it can make all the difference to students early on. According to Dr. Chin, informing students about mental health will be a major goal in preparation for the coming year’s incoming freshmen. CPS will be carving out time to speak with students about the services available, as well as to provide messages of encouragement and to reinforce the message that it’s advisable to reach out for support when needed, as part of freshman orientation this coming fall. Student bodies at Princeton and other campuses have exhibited initiative and a deep concern toward issues of mental health in terms of reaching out to students who might be struggling with stress and pressure. Hopefully, with further development of resource outreach programs and with more openness in conversations surrounding depression and suicide, students will feel comfortable enough seeking help for themselves as well.|~|

82962|~|A journalistic failure|~|   April 7 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|If “Jackie” wasn’t actually raped initially, she certainly has been victimized now — this time by Rolling Stone, her three friends, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and the University of Virginia and its administrators. Calling more attention to rape on college campuses and beyond is extremely important; however, it should not be built on the basis of lies. This past November, Rolling Stone failed the most basic journalistic tenet of telling the truth when they failed to fact-check their article on an alleged gang rape at a fraternity at UVA and the University’s response. When other newspapers started to follow up on the original article, the narrative quickly unraveled. The whole thing did a disservice to sexual assault victims and activists, to journalism as a whole and to the named fraternity and UVA. After it became apparent that there were numerous inaccuracies in the story and Rolling Stone retracted the article, Rolling Stone asked the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism to investigate and write a report about what went wrong. The 12,000-word scathing report came out this past Sunday. In light of this, rather than implement firings and policy changes, Rolling Stone incredibly has double downed and blamed the alleged victim “Jackie,” shifting the blame on her rather than owning up to its own laziness and utter lack of fact-checking. Rolling Stone’s original article and its response to the recent report on the entire scandal ironically mirror what is wrong with our current sexual assault policies on many college campuses. Rolling Stone blamed the survivor and did little to investigate to determine the actual facts. When in the wake of the Rolling Stone article, the police and the Columbia School of Journalism interviewed Jackie’s friends, who she confided in after the incident, they couldn’t corroborate the gang rape. The friends did believe, however, that Jackie had been through some type of trauma. A quick check with these friends would have gotten the fact that Jackie’s story wasn’t quite right but that something had happened to her — and that something that actually happened is important. Now it will probably never be dealt with. Rather than get to the heart of what did happen to Jackie, Rolling Stone was all too eager to print the sensational story and bask in the national spotlight. It is clear now that the story Jackie told was not correct, but it was Rolling Stone’s responsibility to fact-check and get this story right, not Jackie’s. Rolling Stone’s lack of acknowledging its active part in this scandal is only perpetuating the initial problems from the original article. The fact that this article was published with so many errors shows clear problems in its reporting and editing process. The Washington Post first uncovered these inconsistencies only days later. Even after an extensive four-month investigation, the Charlottesville police could not find any substantial evidence that the assaults mentioned in the article had ever occurred. These mistakes certainly should have been caught before being published. Unfortunately the writer, Sabrina Erdely, cannot be fired, as she is a freelance magazine journalist. However, the blame is much more systemic. The editor and fact-checkers also have a responsibility for due diligence to ensure that each story they edit and publish is accurate. While there is no perfect solution, there are many things Rolling Stone could do. For instance, Rolling Stone could state that it will not publish another article by Erdely and those editors and fact-checkers involved with the story could be fired or suspended. But instead they are doing nothing. Rolling Stone is failing to treat this as a journalistic scandal. They’ve damaged the reputations of real people and institutions and potentially created further distrust of sexual assault victims, already a major problem in our society. In fact, the fraternity is now suing Rolling Stone, only bolstering the false narrative of girls crying rape. Rolling Stone’s indifference to the truth is journalistic malpractice and its gravity should be understood as such. The fact that no one has been or is going to be fired or even disciplined, according to CNN, demonstrates that the Rolling Stone leadership is not taking this incident seriously. As the Columbia report mentions, the managing editor acknowledged that “the story’s breakdown reflected both an ‘individual failure’ and ‘procedural failure, an institutional failure.’ ” Erdely let personal feelings toward the issue override good journalistic judgment. Moreover, though apparently a fact-checker is assigned to every article, the recommendations they suggested in edits were never followed up on, nor did they cover the extent of the problems in the piece that they probably should have. The need for sensitivity toward victims does not outweigh a journalist’s responsibility to corroborate and fact-check. While perhaps issues should be phrased carefully, the failure to uphold these journalistic standards ultimately injures everyone more. As the Columbia report summarized perfectly, “the responsibilities that universities have in preventing campus sexual assault — and the standards of performance they should be held to — are important matters of public interest. Rolling Stone was right to take them on. The pattern of its failure draws a map of how to do better.”|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu. 
82960|~|Why USG needs to host debates before referendums|~|   April 7 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Colter Smith|~|   Contributor     |~|The results of the “Hose Bicker” referendum are in, with the hosers (no offense to our neighbors in the north) losing 1120 to 868. Adding these numbers, we can see that only 1988 students out of 5391 undergraduates voted. Thus an overwhelming 63% of undergraduate students decided that the 45 seconds required to log on to Helios and click a few buttons was simply too high a cost for the right to make their voices heard. I can’t help but hypothesize that a general lack of attention to these kinds of campus issues is at least partially to blame. However, another important factor is students’ lack of information about the arguments. This both discourages undergraduates from voting because they lack enough information to make an informed decision and may lead to votes that are cast without full consideration of both sides. With the “Divest Princeton” petition having gotten the requisite number of signatures, it seems that we are poised to have another referendum, this one even more technical and fact-based than the last. Nonetheless, there has been no great drive on campus by students to research all the facts so that we all know exactly what we’re voting on. Though these issues get debated between friends in dining halls or over late meal, such discussions offer only limited views. What we need is to expose the entire university to intelligent, well-thought-out, bipartisan discourse over such issues. That is why I am hereby calling on the University Student Government to institute a policy of hosting a public debate on any issue prior to having a referendum on it. The kind of debate I am proposing is a formal, moderated one between two teams who have spent significant time researching facts and preparing arguments. Essentially, it should be quite similar to the debates Whig-Clio holds all the time. The differences will be in the relevancy of the topic, the timeliness (these debates should occur around a week or two before the referendum) and hopefully greater attendance. For example, Whig-Clio previously hosted a divestment debate. However, the event occurred four months ago and, according to former Whig-Clio president Adam Tcharni ’15, only 30 to 35 people attended. To encourage higher attendance I think several steps should be taken. The debates should be held in a larger and more central area on campus, such as the Frist MPRs, to allow large-scale student access. Ideally the debates should be live-streamed as well to allow for an online audience. Finally, the debates should be well advertised on a broad range of forums at least a week prior to the event to further increase awareness. Hosting such a debate has a number of substantial advantages. First, it helps to inform the student body about the issue. Few students are willing to put in the time to thoroughly research topics such as these. Hosting a debate between two well-informed parties would help to give students the information they need to make up their minds in a well-reasoned way. Second, seeing a debate on this issue would encourage students to have more and better debates about this issue among themselves, both by simply putting the topic into students’ minds (along with arguments for both sides) and by taking the stigma out of debating it. Many issues, such as divestment, can be highly controversial, and as a result many students will only discuss them with people they already know agree with them. By seeing people debate the issue, people will feel more comfortable debating it themselves, and thus one debate creates many more. Finally, this debate would itself act as advertisement for the referendum, encouraging a higher voter turnout. In short, a debate will give us more and better voters. In thinking about this proposition, it is important to ask who would debate for each side. Naturally, those proposing the referendum should, if not themselves debating, be in charge of creating and organizing a team to argue for the referendum. Creating a team for the opposition is trickier, but students could be nominated by other students to be on the opposition. All students who get above a requisite number of nominations will come together to create and organize the opposition team. In such a short column, I can only offer suggestions and I would gladly welcome improvement, but the issue of debaters would have to be addressed. I’m not going to pretend that what I’m proposing is free. Organizing an event like this takes time and effort and we all have a lot on our plates. However, these referendums have campus-wide, and in a few cases, global effects. It’s not enough to simply wing them. I love debate and have always felt that it is the cornerstone of good representative government. The Athenians knew that when they started this whole mess we call democracy. Somehow along the many years, however, we seem to have largely forgotten that piece of wisdom. Let’s bring it back. The more we debate, the smarter our people become about the issues of the day, and the better decisions we end up making about the direction we want our university to go in. USG, give us a debate.|~|
82958|~|Ending the heart of darkness|~|   April 7 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Nicholas Wu|~|   Contributor     |~|The Urban Congo group is offensive, distasteful and morally reprehensible. Kudos goes to Achille Tenkiang ’17, who was able to preserve the video of its performance on YouTube before the group hastily removed it. It is clear that the group members were attempting to be funny, but the truth is that they were anything but that. A large Princeton logo looms in the background of the stage as they go through their act. This is unacceptable for an institution like ours. Their performance continues the long history of cultural reduction of that region of Africa that even extends into Western literature. In his critique of Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness,” Chinua Achebe, the esteemed author of “Things Fall Apart,” declared that Conrad rendered Africa “a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril.” The Urban Congo performance falls into that category of depictions of Africa. On the contrary to some of the discourse, however, this is not a case of “cultural appropriation” insomuch as it is the repugnant depiction of ugly stereotypes dating back to the colonial era like those of “Heart of Darkness” or “Tintin in the Congo.” The online Oxford Reference defines cultural appropriation as “a term used to describe the taking over of creative or artistic forms, themes, or practices by one cultural group from another.” No artistic form was taken over in this instance — the Urban Congo group simply performed its ignorant version of a stereotypical “African” dance. Depictions like this only further reinforce the stereotype of the Congo as a dehumanized land of bongo drums and elephants. In addition to its insensitivity towards Africans, the routine conflates Africans with city-dwellers with its usage of the word “urban” to mean “black,” as if America’s urban centers are “wild,” “uncivilized” places because of their non-white residents. Given that seven out of the 15 most populous American cities have majority-minority populations, this is a highly problematic characterization, especially since the cast of the show was all white. Having grown up in the Detroit area and bearing witness to all of its racial inflammations, I’ve seen firsthand how this kind of racially motivated urban-suburban split can tear a region apart — I often heard my classmates in my suburban high school talk about a fear of “urban” influences as a euphemism for their fears of black people. My own home suburb of Grosse Pointe, which is majority white, erected a farmers’ market in the summer of 2014 across one of the main roads linking Grosse Pointe to the majority black city of Detroit, effectively walling off that section of Grosse Pointe from Detroit. The wall of sheds was only removed in the fall of 2014 after a firestorm of criticism, although the barricades across smaller roads remain. Despite Urban Congo’s insistence that its intentions were not harmful, the optics were certainly bad enough to merit a stronger apology than the milquetoast one delivered by the head of the group, Michael Hauss ’16, who emphasized the way in which the performance can help spark a dialogue on campus. The opportunity for dialogue is there, but it should not deflect criticism from those responsible. The first step toward preventing more incidents like this one is tightening the requirements for funding and recognition from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students (ODUS). The Daily Princetonian reports that the group was “recognized and sponsored” by ODUS, which never should have happened in the first place had there been a more stringent review of the group’s intended activities. The name alone should have been a dead giveaway for its offensive potential, and I am not sure why those who approved the group did not give pause when the group’s name slid across their desk. What should have happened is an inquiry into the group’s intended actions. This stringency of review need not be a constraint on free speech — a balance can be struck between legitimate cultural expression and bigotry. A group can say or express what it wants so long as it does not provoke harm to others as per its First Amendment rights, but that doesn’t mean that it has to receive ODUS recognition and sponsorship, or be free of criticism, for that matter. In her April 6 column, Daily Princetonian columnist Zeena Mubarak wrote that we should consider the ramifications of our actions, given the backlash against this show. I agree with her completely. Much of the press about these kinds of offensive incidents tends to center around depictions of black people, but the same logic applies to all groups, be they black, Asian, or otherwise. It’s not even simply a matter of cultural sensitivity — it’s just a matter of basic decency towards your fellow students. There are legitimate grievances about the offensiveness of these incidents, and reductionist, inflammatory statements like many of those on social media have done nothing to help the discourse about such weighty issues. This campus only has 5,300-odd undergraduate students living together inside the Orange Bubble. Let’s get along, shall we?|~|Nicholas Wu is a freshman from Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich.

82821|~|The Spelman Draw and more choices for Independents|~|   April 6 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Avaneesh Narla|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Two weeks ago, upperclassmen participated in the draw for housing in Spelman. Spelman apartments — which each have four singles, a common room, a bathroom and a kitchen — are one of the most popular housing options for upperclassmen who have decided to go Independent, as it gives them much-needed access to a place to privately prepare food. For independent students, access to a kitchen is of utmost importance as it is often their primary source of food. While independent-designated rooms in upperclass housing are supposed to have easy access to kitchens, they often do not and many students aren’t comfortable sharing a kitchen with other students due to dietary restrictions, concerns regarding cleanliness and security of food. Monica Wei ’17, who unsuccessfully drew for Spelman and will now be living in independent housing next year, said “Going independent outside Spelman can be very inconvenient, as our room next year isn’t on the same floor as the kitchen. I am also anxious about the idea of sharing a kitchen with people I don’t know.” Thus, many independent students find that Spelman is the only conducive housing option. If it is any indication, more students drew for Spelman this year than for independent housing (both draws require at least half of the group to pledge independent). In fact, many students opt not to go independent if they aren’t able to get a Spelman quad during room draw. Neeta Patel ’16, who was unsuccessful in Spelman draw, enrolled in a meal plan instead. She comments, “Going independent without a Spelman room is not really an option. None of the independent options are conducive to cooking. One has to look to alternate options.” Danny Waldroop ’17, who was also unsuccessful in Spelman draw and intends on joining an Eating Club next year comments, “I knew immediately after we found out that we weren’t getting a Spelman Room that I didn’t want to be independent next year. Not having the Spelman community or a personal kitchen made me decide so.” The University should make more options available for independent housing, and more importantly, improve existing options so as to make going independent easier. Currently, many students are forced to adopt one of the more expensive dining options, usually an Eating Club or a residential college dining plan, due to the lack of suitable options. Maya Rosen ’17, independent, said “The University should construct more apartment style housing.” Another alternative might be to adapt existing rooms to accommodate kitchens. Some of the larger quads, triples and even some doubles are big enough to house a small kitchen. Independent students would appreciate the small kitchen over available common space. Further, though Housing Services recognizes lack of independent housing spaces and the importance of Spelman for independents and awards them priority in the Spelman draw, they don’t do enough. Because of an outstanding demand for Spelman rooms, many fully independent groups failed to get a room this year. In light of this, I propose that Housing Services should give more points to independent students so that they can secure a living space conducive to being independent for the entire year. The Spelman draw is ranked based on the average number of points of the group drawing. An individual gets two additional points if they are independent, in addition to the two for rising juniors and three for rising seniors. In previous years, almost all groups with four or more points got a room; thus, a fully independent group almost always got a room. This year, however, not even one four point group full of independent juniors was able to get a Spelman room. The rising number of applicants is indicative of the increasing demand for independent housing: according to the Housing Services website, 359 students drew Spelman this year for 52 available quads, compared to 308 last year, 256 in 2011 and 168 in 2006. In previous years, this meant that students were assured a Spelman quad if all students in the group were independent; this is no longer true. On the other hand, due to the way the point system works, some groups with as many as three non-independent students (in a group of eight) were able to get Spelman quads, as they were all seniors. Gaining three, or even four, points instead of just two for pledging independent would help fully independent groups get Spelman rooms over groups with non-independent students. This disadvantage towards independents is bolstered by the ability to draw in groups larger than four. This enables seniors to leverage their points and enable non-independents to draw with them. Also, this means that juniors drawing with seniors have an advantage over other juniors, even if they have fewer independents. This holds even if the seniors don’t choose a room given the option to do so. This year, a group of seven mysteriously participated in the draw, and though they couldn’t have drawn two rooms, their large number of points due to seniors meant that some could draw into a quad. Restricting the size of groups to four would help ensure that Spelman rooms go to the independent students for whom they were designed. The needs of independent students should be given preference over the fact that a draw group is composed of seniors. The administration has repeatedly made efforts to cater to the large proportion of independent students, and this would help in doing so. This has been made even more relevant as the number of independent students is rapidly increasing every year. Without some tangible change, choosing alternative eating options at Princeton will become harder than ever.|~|Avaneesh Narla is a sophomore from Calcutta, India.

82837|~|What we can learn from Urban Congo|~|   April 6 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|Princeton Urban Congo is a joke dance group made up of members from the Princeton Men’s Swim and Dive Team. Their most recent performance was at Saturday’s eXpressions show. A video of one of their performances can be viewed online. Everything about the group from their name to their costumes to the way they dance is offensive and perpetuates stereotypes of Africans. After a strongly negative social media reaction to their performance at the eXpressions dance show, the president of Urban Congo, Michael Hauss ’16, apologized, saying, “Though we did not intend to denigrate other cultures, we realize that this fact does not absolve us in the least. We created something that was inexcusably offensive, and we appreciate all those who called attention to our mistake.” The group also took down their Facebook page and videos. Although I appreciate Hauss’ apology, I don’t think sweeping it under the rug is the right way forward. I believe that it is important to examine the reasons why the group was found to be so offensive and talk about and understand these reasons. Otherwise, we run the risk of repeating the mistake. The name of the group is fundamentally offensive. First of all, by naming itself “Congo” it is clearly referring to one of two African countries. This means that all the rest of the group’s actions must be put into that context. The group members have contextualized their dance pieces as being references to Africa and African cultures. The second part of the name “Urban” is a little bit more subtle. But, as Republican strategist Lee Atwater is infamously known for saying, direct racism “backfires,” so people, especially politicians, use coded racial language instead, such as substituting “urban” for “black.” It is an easy way to make points and arguments that would be censored today for being racist. With this information in mind, it is clear that the group is openly referencing black people and Africans from the very start with that name. Even if there were still doubts over the name of the group, its performance confirms the group’s racial mockery. Urban Congo members wear body paint and loincloths over their swim team speedos. These costumes are derived from Western stereotypes of indigenous African clothing. The members also dance in a way that is clearly supposed to represent those same Western stereotypes. Their dance also includes the picking up and placing of objects in a pantomime of indigenous peoples interacting with an altar. The problem with Urban Congo is that they reduce an entire range of diverse cultures into a very basic, cartoonish, mocking facsimile of themselves. This in turn contributes to the larger issue of the lack of nuance in the way people regard African cultures. The group’s intention in doing this was to go for cheap laughs. You only have to look at the reaction of the audience to understand that. First the group reduces a complex and beautiful range of cultures into one narrow idea, taken from wrongful Western stereotypes. Then it presents that culture to the audience to be laughed at. When we look at this, especially in the context of the historical relationship between the West and Africa, it should not be difficult to see why this is so hurtful to African students. Personally, as an African student, I was not surprised to see this train wreck go down, because it is indicative of the larger disregard with which people treat African cultures. However, I was extremely hurt to see it happen here and to see Princeton students happily partaking in it. Moving forward, I hope we can all try and think more about both the intentions of our actions and the effects they have on others. Let’s have more care in the way we depict cultures. Let’s avoid reducing them to figures of ridicule just for a couple of giggles at a dance show.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va. She can be reached at zmubarak@princeton.edu. 
82831|~|Rock bands and cultural appropriation|~|   April 6 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Last month, one of my favorite new bands encountered a bit of a controversy in the college music circuit, a scene typically known for its support for independent artists. Ivan Krasnov, a promoter for the Oberlin College venue Dionysus Disco, canceled a show scheduled for March 14 by the band Viet Cong, claiming in an apology letter that the name was “grossly ignorant” and “deeply offensive.” After reading this news, I first identified with what I saw as a serious artistic group bold enough to choose a subversive and attention-grabbing name. However, as I looked more into the band’s comments on the name and some responses, I realized that Krasnov was justified in criticizing a group with a truly insensitive and problematic name, as first generation Vietnamese-American Sang Nguyen powerfully argues. As it turns out, the name actually originates from an off-handed racist comment. But beyond this insensitivity, Krasnov argues that the name is “blatantly appropriative.” “The fact that the band openly acknowledges their problematic name, yet fails to change it or do anything about it,” Krasnov writes, “highlights this blatantly appropriative move, reinforcing a tradition of American (and Western) orientalism and appropriation.” To me, it seems like a stretch to connect an independent rock band with marginal name recognition in certain hipster circles to a narrative of Western orientalism — especially while hugely successful pop stars dress as geishas or don Hindu symbols. Or, for that matter, as Americans unthinkingly help themselves to Westernized yoga and “Chinese” food. While this band chose to appropriate an element of Far Eastern culture with a particular baggage of trauma, our society seems saturated with varying degrees of appropriation of elements from many historically marginalized cultures. And while some, like yoga, may be perfectly innocuous, other instances can be harmful in exoticizing or exploiting the identity of the cultural other. The cancellation of this performance, from a group that falls far from the mainstream, may not represent much of a challenge to cultural imperialism (and were I an Oberlin student, I honestly would have liked to see the band). Still, the incident seems important to me as sign of a shift in conversation about the way we consider the cultural other. It seems fitting to me that Krasnov cites the Oberlin protests in his apology letter, because it signals what to me represents a more recent development; while political imperialism has been an inescapable subject of conversation at Oberlin since at least the days of their anti-Vietnam War protests, cultural imperialism is now becoming a common reference point on other campuses as well. Krasnov’s actions suggest a promising engagement with a hugely important issue. Another recent and more visible controversy suggests the importance of symbolic imperialism: the University of California, Irvine student government’s vote to ban flags of any country in their office lobby. In this case, the actions of a few students have been hugely overblown in the public reaction, but it stills serves to highlight the question inherent to discussions about cultural appropriation: to what extent can symbols be normalizing or oppressive? Which symbols become problematic in certain contexts, whether from the mainstream (the U.S. flag) or from the marginalized (“Viet Cong”)? The negotiation of cultural spaces and the distinction between exchange and appropriation are complex and ambiguous, but most importantly, necessary. Especially for all of us young college students with limited experience outside academic environments, especially those of us coming from places of privilege, these issues are important. How and when do we deal with the problematic aspects of another culture’s history or identity? When do we overstep into cultural appropriation as we use elements of the other’s history or identity as part of our own art or study? Still, there are less ambiguous cases when students cross the line, such as the recent Urban Congo fiasco (which to me barely even qualifies as cultural appropriation — it’s more an issue of plain racial ignorance and insensitivity). And despite the gray area, I think that we can find some helpful examples of true cultural appropriation. For that, we need look no further than Azalea, the biggest Australian rap star in entertainment. As Brittney Cooper points out, “Iggy profits from the cultural performativity and forms of survival that Black women have perfected, without having to encounter and deal with the social problem that is the Black female body.” Most importantly, we should be sensitive to the perspectives of those at the other end of exploitative appropriation. Since Krasnov acted on the advice of the Vietnamese Student Association at Oberlin, I’ll give him credit despite my fandom. So while the cancellation of a hipster band’s performance may not be the most productive response to cultural imperialism, it nevertheless represents a meaningful engagement with an important conversation. We could all stand to be more aware of the presence of cultural appropriation and, above all, to be wary of faux-Native American headresses and Iggy Azalea.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I.

82715|~|Editorial: Take the WeSpeak survey-- ‘It’s a Princeton issue.’|~|   April 5 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Last week, an opinion column was published in The Daily Princetonian by members of the Faculty-Student Committee on Sexual Misconduct urging the student body of the University to participate in the “WeSpeak: Attitudes on Sexual Misconduct at Princeton” survey. According to an email distributed to students by the committee, the objective of the survey is simple: to learn about the prevalence of sexual assault at Princeton and to more effectively address issues related to sexual violence and sexual assault. The Editorial Board recognizes the critical importance of accurate data related to instances of sexual assault and sexual violence at the University, and the Board is concerned that an initially low response rate may have caused the University to extend the survey deadline. Consequently, we urge every student to participate in the survey before its April 7 deadline. Sexual assault, sexual violence and the accompanying culture are pervasive on college campuses. The problem affects women and men. It affects our roommates and teammates. It affects our friends and family. These instances of assault and violence cannot be meaningfully quantified because every prior attempt to administer surveys similar to WeSpeak has yielded imprecise results. Both a 2008 survey distributed by the University and a 2011 study conducted by the American College Health Association were characterized by gross under-participation. We do not know if the results of these surveys over-represent or under-represent rates of sexual assault and violence at the University. Statistics from surveys conducted nationwide offer the University even less stable footing. The commonly cited statistic that one in five females enrolled in college will be a victim of sexual assault or sexual violence during her university years comes from the Campus Sexual Assault Study, a survey conducted by the Justice Department’s National Institute of Justice. The NIJ only polled undergraduate females at two large public universities, and, according to researchers, the response rate of these universities was low. To solve the problems related to sexual assault and sexual violence at the University, University administrators must understand the complex nature of the problem. Surveys with low levels of participation are unable to give an accurate picture of campus issues and prevent us from understanding the problem we are trying to solve. A Princeton-specific survey will help to isolate what is and is not working with current University policies, and the results will help to shape better, more effective policy going forward. Simply put, the results of WeSpeak will give information that no other survey can provide to the University community. Maximizing participation will help the University account for the diversity of campus experiences, perceptions and opinions as it shapes and implements new policy. Subsequent policy changes will be inclusive and will foster safety in the Princeton community. Pragmatic benefits aside, the Board believes that each student has an obligation to complete WeSpeak. Princeton is not simply a community; rather, it is our community. Each of us has the right to not only be safe here, but also to feel safe. Even if you feel like you have not encountered sexual misconduct on campus or feel like you do not know enough about the issue, it is important to participate. WeSpeak is not only meant for members of our community who have worked on these issues. It is meant for all of us. The least we can do for one another is to take less than 20 minutes in the coming days to complete the survey. WeSpeak is an opportunity for each of us to make a meaningful and positive contribution to Princeton for our peers and for generations of Princetonians to come. If you wish to make further comments on this important issue beyond what is addressed in the survey, the Board encourages you to email WeSpeak at wespeak@princeton.edu to share your thoughts.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of The Daily Princetonian.

82705|~|For career success, major in art history|~|   April 5 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By W. Barksdale Maynard ’88 Maybe your parents warned you that an art history degree means a job pumping gas at your local Shell station. Or perhaps you listened to President Barack Obama’s 2014 speech in which he proclaimed, “Folks can make a lot more, potentially, with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree.” If you think these warnings ring true, you’d better think again: the humanities in general, and art history in particular, can be a powerful ticket to career success. Art history plunges you deep into critical thinking about the world’s cultures, about the nature of creativity and genius, about the ineffable sources of greatness in human endeavor — and if it’s a good fit for you personally, the long-term results can be extraordinary. “I’m convinced that being an art history major helped me stand out as an applicant to Stanford Business School,” Kelly Sortino ’03 tells me. “Since then, I have worked at Boston Consulting Group and Google — and no one batted an eyelash that I didn’t pursue a more ‘practical’ major.” She adds, “Being an art history major allowed me to differentiate myself from the sea of economics and computer science majors out there!” Sortino is right: when one in five American undergraduates is majoring in business, your “safe” major could land you in a vast, turgid sea of lookalike business school resumes — a sea that grows by nearly 400,000 every June. I’ve been asking my fellow Princeton alumni if an art history major helped their career or hurt it. All say that it helped — and in ways they never could have predicted when they were 20. “My art history education was the first step in training my eye to recognize the recurring signatures of price movement in the financial markets,” Jamie Crapanzano ’00, portfolio manager at Guggenheim Partners, told me. Who would have guessed? “Majoring in art history brilliantly expanded my ability to solve problems in medicine,” says noted psychiatrist Jeremy Spiegel ’92, who fondly recalls “the nurturing and consciousness-expanding playpen” of the Department of Art and Archaeology. As a vice president of NBA Entertainment, Stephen Hellmuth ’75 has made design innovations to arena display screens that enhance the drama of basketball for all of us. In this and other endeavors involving complex visual systems, his “degree from art and archeology was essential,” he says. Once more, art history proves itself astonishingly useful in unpredictable ways. “Majoring in art history allowed me to relate to and understand the psychology of the creative mind,” says Sara Dennis ’87, who has been senior vice president at top fashion companies, including Lands’ End. Dennis has drawn from art history again and again, because “the beauty of the major is that the student can explore a plethora of topics, from science to politics.” The Tigers I spoke to agree that art history expands your mind and can launch you into the career world with an explosive burst. And these graduates end up everywhere. “I had the pleasure of studying a subject matter I really loved, and gaining cultural literacy,” says Kristin Hodgson ’03, communications director of Meetup, the world’s largest network of local groups (social networking based on geographic locale). Like others, Hodgson warns against choosing a “safe” major. But what about the pressure you are getting from your parents? You are not alone: a 2012 survey showed that 42 percent of parents push their children towards majors that will supposedly pay off (the Princeton Class of 2014 gravitated especially to economics and politics). “My father spent his entire career at Citibank and was concerned that I would not be able to find a decent job if I majored in art history,” Jason Harris ’00 remembers. “But I landed my first job after graduation at Morgan Stanley.” Harris, who now heads a huge Presbyterian church on Park Avenue, recalls that first Morgan Stanley interview: “I spent most of it talking about Picasso with a man who was an art aficionado.” That conversation might not have happened had Harris chosen a “safe” major. Beware: majors geared towards business and seemingly safe sectors in fact tend to produce underemployed graduates, Fortune has shown. Often, graduates of safe majors report lower rates of job satisfaction. “You have all your working life to concentrate on things that are boring and make you miserable — don’t start early!” warns Alexandra de Campi ’92. “I majored in art history because it combined the best of all other liberal arts majors: history, politics, economics, sociology,” de Campi told me. “I then went on to be an equity research analyst in Hong Kong.” Today she is a famous music video director and writer. Don’t blow your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fall in love with a major. Remember: the humanities just might supercharge your career. They certainly won’t hurt it: even those ultra-rigorous medical schools show no preference in admissions for Princeton science majors over Princeton majors in humanities and social sciences. And if your parents still don’t believe you, tell them that The Telegraph reported a few days ago in “What Degree Should You Study to Become a Billionaire?” that 9 percent of the 100 richest people on the Forbes list studied arts in college — more than those who majored in economics (8 percent) and finance (3 percent).|~|W.

82734|~|The voice in voting|~|   April 5 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|When I received an email from the Undergraduate Student Government containing details on how to vote on the widely talked about Bicker referendum, I rolled my eyes and deleted it in a snap. I disagreed with the referendum for a number of reasons. I am a happy member of a sign-in club and have close friends who are independent, eating at dining halls and members of Bicker clubs. I also happen to dislike policing when people — students — have the capabilities to address issues personally and independently. But more than that, I was under the impression that many other people agreed with these sentiments, too. Based on Facebook posts, conversations I had with friends and just general talk I had heard during dinner or after classes, I had assumed a large percentage of the student body thought “Hose Bicker” was unnecessary. Imagine my surprise, then, when I received another USG email containing the results of the Bicker referendum. Though the number of those against the referendum outnumbered those who favored it, the margin by which it did so was surprisingly low. About 56 percent of those who voted said no, while a little under 44 percent said yes. I began to question what I had previously presumed about popular opinion on Bicker. Did such a large portion of the undergraduate student body really want to do away with the process? These thoughts reached a halt, however, when I saw the actual amount of students who had voted on the referendum. Of the 5,200 undergraduate students, only 1,988 had voted. That is significantly lower than half of the student body. I initially was surprised by the low voter turnout. Eventually, however, I realized that several students may have had the same thoughts as I did: There’s an extremely small chance this will pass, as most people I’ve talked to are against the measure. Even if it does pass, the likelihood of any serious change is also small, as the eating clubs are independent institutions. Finally, this referendum really affects me in no way. This line of thinking may be fairly harmless in a university setting. While the types of things we vote on through the USG affect campus culture and aspects of our college experience, they are not central to the lives we will live after graduation. However, these same excuses cannot be said for referenda we vote on at the local or state level, or for those politicians that we choose to represent us in Congress. Those votes — or thereof — permeate parts of our lives even when we are unaware of them. Moreover, they do not begin to do so after we leave Princeton; they do so now. Only a week or so ago, I was in my American politics precept, discussing Congress, when our preceptor asked us how many of us had actually voted in an election — presidential, Congressional or even local. Few hands went up. Even including students under the voting age and the one international student ineligible to vote, the number was surprisingly small. When our precept asked why, the reasons for not voting varied. Some said they did not vote because they weren’t informed enough, others said they simply hadn’t gotten around to it, someone said it didn’t matter enough to them, and some thought that their votes simply did not matter. These are all often cited reasons why large numbers of people—particularly young adults—do not vote. It’s easy to understand why someone would be apathetic to voting considering the state of Congress as of late. It’s not illogical that people don’t vote on something that they don’t consider directly affects them. Yet, the fact remains that votes must matter. The historical struggle for enfranchisement of marginalized groups — both in and outside the United States — tell us as much. And we’ve seen the effects that voting can have both nationally — with Senator Al Franken’s 2008 election to the Senate  decided by less than 300 votes — and on campus – with USG’s decision to sign an amicus brief on the behalf of the plaintiffs in Lewis v. Harris, a gay marriage case before the New Jersey Supreme court in 2005. We have seen the direct effects that our opinions can have. And so, if something does not seem critical to our personal lives — whether it be a Bicker referendum or student election — we must ask ourselves, if our vote doesn’t count now, if our voices don’t matter here, when and where will they? Although we are in college for only a short amount of time (in the grand scheme of our lives), much of what we do here lays the foundation for what we pursue — and how we pursue it — after exiting FitzRandolph Gates. Academic courses drive personal interests and change our professional desires. Student organizations inform us of what matters to us outside of the classroom, and often, students stay dedicated to these themes and missions within or outside of their careers. Our independent work can spark curiosity and lead to further research. What we do at Princeton doesn’t narrowly restrict our lives’ paths, but these patterns give a glimpse of what is to come. So while voting on campus may not seem critical, doing so may be critical in determining whether we vote in our greater civic sphere.|~|
82579|~|The post-secondary gamble|~|   April 2 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Last week in Las Vegas, I was confronted with a difficult reality — that your path in life may depend solely on where you live, how much your family makes, the outcome of a lottery, and even which teachers are willing to commit to your district. If you haven’t seen “Waiting for Superman,” Guggenheim’s documentary would be a good start to understanding the problems facing the American public education system. Many academic settings in the United States are adulterated by a multitude of these structural and social determinants of education. Perhaps the problem lies in racial and socio-economic achievement gaps, organizational structure or skewed teacher incentives. After traveling down to Las Vegas, however, for a peek at the fifth largest school district in the nation, I’d like to entertain a different idea. Our education system is too narrow, focused on readying students to attend a four-year college or university. As denoted by William Synmonds’ 2011 paper, the emphasis on college-going relies on an implicit assumption. It assumes that an education tailored to the academic requirements established by four-year colleges will prepare adolescents for future success. Perhaps this isn’t true anymore — perhaps a four-year college education isn’t for everyone. Take a city like Las Vegas, for example, the focus of the breakout trip I participated in over spring break. Many blue-collar customer-servicing jobs, whether working hospitality at a high-end hotel or dealing cards at a Vegas casino, generate far more cash than entry-level positions requiring a college degree. I would be remiss to label any of the individuals in these positions as failures — many have bachelor’s degrees, are accredited with professional licenses and are exceptionally talented artists. Brittany Bronson, an English instructor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is one of these figures. Despite having a Masters, she holds a second job serving at a chain restaurant off the Strip for economic security. Brittany risks the image she presents to her students as a university mentor for her true love of learning. Like her, many of her students hold similar part-time jobs, and 60 percent of her freshman will forego their college degrees to retain them. But unlike her, their decision to enroll in college may have stemmed from a lack of alternative pathways to success. Erica Mosca, another educator in east Las Vegas, founded a nonprofit which contributes to giving these students equitable post-secondary opportunities. She aims to make her students both college-ready and career-ready through a Leader-In-Training program, giving them the opportunity to make their own post-secondary choices. Our curricula have not always been geared towards college. At the start of the twentieth century, our nation underwent a feat that most other western nations would achieve some 30 to 50 years later. Newly afforded a system of education that was open to all — unhindered by universal standards and decentralized — American youth entered high school at a rapid rate to learn skills “for life” rather than “for college.” With a mere 9 percent of 18-year-olds holding diplomas in 1910, the United States oversaw measures to increase that number to around 40 percent by 1940. By the mid-1930s, graduation rates were as high as policymakers had forecasted for 1960. At a time when no European nation had a full-time schooling rate for older youths exceeding 25 percent, the United States secondary school enrollment rate was just below 80 percent. For decades, the United States remained at the forefront of educational achievement. Yet today, for the first time in our nation’s history, United States educational attainment is in danger of receding from current levels. Today, we’re ranked 14th in education worldwide. Today, we’re 17th in educational performance and 54th in educational expenditures. Today, our spectacular educational transformation has been reduced to 66 percent of all fourth graders lacking proficiency in reading. Can’t we catch up? It turns out that early reading proficiency is one of the most important predictors of high school graduation and career success. At the end of the third grade, students transition between learning to read and reading to learn. Student who fall behind that critical milestone rarely catch up, remaining four times more likely to drop out of high school. And because they have fallen behind in elementary school, these students are hindered from being able to make a post-secondary choice. Perhaps college isn’t for everyone. Many of the most successful nations in northern and central Europe emphasize high-quality career counseling and career education. That is not to say Europe is perfect – the story gets a bit muddled, since students there are tracked from a very young age, and separated onto either a college-bound or vocational track. But these nations recognize that multiple pathways to prosperity exist, instead of positing college as the holy grail of post-secondary decisions. Perhaps college isn’t for everyone. Nevada might be ranked last among the states in education, but Las Vegas’ abundance of magnet and vocational, trade and technical schools offer a new hope. Its dedicated employers are partnering with high schools to provide career-counseling and work-based learning. Its key stakeholders have pledged to collaboratively improve pathways for those left behind. Perhaps college isn’t for everyone. But the choice of a post-secondary path is.|~|Yoni Benyamini is an ORFE major from Roslyn, New York. He can be reached at yb@princeton.edu. 
82189|~|Self-deprecating humor?|~|   April 2 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|A few days ago, Girls creator and lightning rod for both endless praise and endless controversy Lena Dunham wrote what I assume was intended to be a “humor” piece in the New Yorker entitled “Dog or Jewish Boyfriend? A Quiz.” In it, she cracks one-off jokes about ostensible similarities between a stereotypical pampered pooch and a stereotypical pampered Jewish man, silently chuckling at things like “hair all over his body, like most males who share his background.” The piece has blown up since its publication, as a piece like this tends to. Some critics have been bandying about its purported “disgusting antisemitic garbage.” Some supporters (most of whom are Jewish themselves), on the other hand, praise the piece’s place in the “time-honored part of the Jewish comic tradition” of making fun of one’s own people. (Dunham’s mother is Jewish.) Like many of the piece’s critics, I don’t take issue with tasteful Jewish humor. As a Jew, I find the norm of “self-deprecating” Jewish humor and the “wry self-knowledge” a Salon article ascribes to Dunham’s piece to be quite funny when done right. Hence, like many of the piece’s critics, my first issue with Dunham’s piece is that at no point is it actually humorous. It feels like it’s trying to make me smirk at lines like “I have more Instagram followers than he does” (given that Dunham has over one and a half million Instagram followers, I’d be more surprised if that weren’t the case). New Yorker editor-in-chief David Remnick praised Dunham’s piece as “a comic voice working in [the Jewish-comic] vein.” However, I’m not so certain support of the Jewish comedic tradition can be extended to something just for being written by a (part) Jew when I haven’t found anyone (supporters included) who has laughed at it. Here’s the rub, though: part of the reason Greenburg and Silverman succeed is because their humor is sincerely self-deprecating, able to walk the line between stifling political correctness and outright anti-Semitism thanks to an involvement of self. Dunham’s piece, on the other hand, isn’t self-deprecating in the slightest. Despite Dunham’s Jewishness, she paints herself as an almost external actor here, poking fun at her boyfriend while simultaneously removing herself from the clutches of the Jewish identity she skewers. This stance is particularly clear when Dunham states that “he comes from a culture in which mothers focus every ounce of their attention on their offspring and don’t acknowledge their own need for independence as women.” If this piece were self-knowing, as supporters claim, Dunham might have used the word “we.” By instead using the word “he,” Dunham moves herself out of the spotlight, accusing her figurative boyfriend of being coddled by a culture of which she wants us to know she has no part. A piece like this, in order to participate in the tradition of so many legendary Jewish comedians, must be written from a Jewish perspective first and foremost. Dunham can absolutely write this as a Jewish woman, but in order for it to fit into the “self-knowledge” already enumerated here, the Jewishness must take precedence. In putting the word “Jewish” in the title, Dunham needs to tackle this piece as a Jew before letting any of her other identities approach. By refusing to implicate herself as a member of the culture she criticizes, Dunham loses the credibility she needs in order to play a legitimate part in the rich history of Jewish comedy. Remnick likened the piece to “Richard Pryor and Chris Rock doing the same about black stereotypes.” Personally, I would compare it less to those honestly self-aware comedians and more to Bill Cosby’s Pound Cake Speech at the 2004 NAACP awards, in which Cosby severely criticized modern Black culture: “The lower economic and lower middle economic people are [not*] holding their end in this deal.” The most insightful criticism I’ve seen, which largely applies to Dunham’s piece as well, comes from a review of a Michael Eric Dyson book about the speech from the Harvard Education Review: “Cosby has built up years of cultural capital and credibility while ignoring race to establish a platform for himself that he is using to lambast and criticize poor Blacks rather than defend them.” Much like Dunham, in removing himself from the group of people he’s denouncing, Cosby also removes his perspective from the place it needs to be to tackle this subject. In the end, “Dog or Jewish Boyfriend? A Quiz” fails because it doesn’t say anything particularly worthwhile. It’s not funny, it’s not insightful, it’s not even particularly well-conceived or well-written. Most of the critics calling out the piece’s anti-Semitism (especially those who are likely not Jewish themselves) are, as Remnick puts it, “howling in the wrong direction.” However, those who would place Dunham’s piece in the pantheon of great Jewish comedy (for reasons that don’t actually relate to the piece’s comedy, I assume) are also mistaken. The “Jewish comedic tradition” many Jews (myself included) love so much succeeds largely due to an inclusion of self in the culture at which good comedians so nostalgically jab. By removing herself from this culture — whether via a choice pronoun or a more overt criticism of his failure to tip — Dunham changes her role from humorous critic to problematic accuser.|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

82603|~|Editorial: encouraging female leadership on campus|~|   April 2 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|The Daily Princetonian recently published an article, as part of a four-part Women’s History Month feature series, on the rise of female visibility and leadership in major campus organizations as well as on the Street. While many women have been elected in recent years to ‘visible’ positions such as president of the USG, chair of the Honor Committee and editor-in-chief of the ‘Prince,’ Princeton has yet to fully bridge the gender gap. After all, while these elections demonstrate progress, many Princeton undergraduate women continue to face barriers to leadership positions. For example, when an organization’s officer corps or membership body is predominantly male, female members may drop out if they feel uncomfortable or if they do not see opportunities for leadership in the future. This creates a cycle of low female retention rates and low female visibility in leadership roles. Thus in order to better facilitate and encourage female leadership on campus, the Board urges campus organizations such as the Women’s Center to change their outreach campaigns in order to foster more inclusive dialogue. Furthermore, the Board encourages all University and student groups to push for more diverse representation and female visibility, especially at recruiting events. In early Fall, the Princeton Women’s Mentorship Program sent out an email to all Wilson sophomores about upcoming events. While sent out to all sophomores, the email was specifically addressed to “Princeton Women.” This past October, the Women’s Center ran a series of poster campaigns with headlines such as, “USG: where men are presidents and women are secretaries.” While it is undeniable that these mentorship programs and publicity campaigns have increased campus dialogue about female leadership, the Board urges organizations to consider advertising that is more welcoming towards men. By making the advertising more inclusive, men could be better encouraged to attend and contribute to discussion about female leadership. Many of the current discussion groups and events mainly attract women who are passionate about gender inequality and who are already aware of the problems on campus. If these events are more welcoming of men, especially those who are not very familiar with the topic, then there is an opportunity to break out of this circle and engage a larger section of the Princeton community. In addition to fostering more inclusive dialogue, all campus organizations should strive to promote the visibility of female leaders and highlight leadership opportunities early on in the year. An institutional problem for many male-dominated clubs is female-member retention rates. Women who feel uncomfortable in these clubs or who don’t see a possibility for leadership roles often times drop out and choose other activities. This can leave clubs with a comparatively small pool of females for leadership positions, further perpetuating this vicious cycle. In order to address this issue, the Women’s Center should offer workshops for student groups leaders on how to better engage and retain female members. University centers and individual student groups could also offer more programs and panels in early fall or before major election periods that spotlight female leaders and introduce the leadership positions available on campus. During the school year, student organizations with an exclusive officer corps should strive to delegate leadership opportunities to a diverse membership body, especially females. When students feel engaged and see opportunities for leadership early on, they are more likely to stay involved. Furthermore, at recruiting events such as Princeton Preview, student groups should strive to have diverse gender representation at the activities fair and open houses. Interacting with active female club members at these recruiting events can make joining less intimidating for prospective female students. While Princeton has made great strides towards gender equality in recent years, there still remains work to be done. Thus in order to better facilitate and encourage female leadership on campus, Princeton organizations should foster dialogue more inclusive of men and look for opportunities to spotlight female leadership on campus.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of The Daily Princetonian.

82371|~|Dalliance and dopamine: another look at hookups|~|   April 1 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Steve Swanson|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|There was a time when it seemed that every time you’d open The Daily Princetonian there would be an opinion piece about “hookup culture.” Gallons of ink were spilled over the issue, with anonymous contributors sharing sexual anecdotes while columnists agonized over the culture’s effect on gender roles and romantic orientation, with a fair amount of moralizing thrown in for good measure. The interminable debates inspired parody by the Tiger Magazine and, of course, commentary by the Princeton Tory. It seems that the campus breathed a sigh of relief as the argument gradually wore itself out and the view that “if you don’t want to hook up, don’t hook up,” as summarized by Colby Pines, reasserted itself as the default sentiment. Since the beginning of this academic year, I haven’t been aware of any resurgence of this debate — for which I’m sure most are grateful. That being said, hookups are an undeniably prominent part of the Princeton culture and experience, and one that most incoming students aren’t familiar with as high schools tend to be more relationship-oriented. It’s therefore worth it to take a critical look at this aspect of our culture, rather than just accepting the status quo. The first thing that jumps out about the practice of serial hookups is that it is rarely, if ever, designed to be a long-term plan. I don’t know if statistics for Princeton students exist, but the U.S. Census indicates that by the age of 30, over 80 percent of Americans have been married at least once and over 60 percent remain so. While marriage rates are on the decline for our generation, it still seems true that the endgame for most people involves, eventually, a spouse and children. In this regard, serial hookups don’t fit with most students’ future plans; at some point, those who want monogamy will presumably eventually want to replace the uncommitted, casual sexuality of hookups with the commitment and emotional attachment of a serious relationship. This disconnect between serial hookups and most people’s future plans is not too concerning on its own. We do lots of things here that we don’t plan on doing after — living in dormitories, taking classes, singing in a capella groups, doing sports, drinking like sailors — so why should our sexual relationships be any different? The difference, in fact, is something peculiar to sex: its uniquely powerful reward mechanism. A discussion of the effect of sex on the brain could very quickly devolve into an excursus on neurochemistry and evolutionary psychology. Leaving the technicalities aside, it suffices to say that humans have a strong reward system for sex: having an orgasm causes the release of neurotransmitters that ingrain the behaviors that led up to it. This makes sense in an evolutionary perspective as sex is linked to reproductive success — those primates that were able to learn what behaviors were associated with successfully having sex were more likely to pass on their genes. The danger is that one cannot choose exactly which associations the brain will strengthen, as seen in a series of studies since the 1960s which successfully conditioned subjects to respond with sexual arousal to stimuli as varied as boots or jars. What does the power of sex as a training device mean for hookups? At the very least, it means that we should be cautious. If every sexual experience embeds an association between its circumstances and reproductive success, casual sex will only tend to make one want more casual sex. Worse can happen if hookups are being sought for a reason other than pure physical desire: hooking up to combat low self-esteem will associate low self-esteem with reproductive success; hooking up to be seen as cool will associate sex with social climbing. Neither of these examples are conducive to the formation of healthy, committed, long-term relationships. Of course, we shouldn’t condemn hookups based on just this speculated effect. Data is always preferred. Few good studies have investigated the long-term effects of sexual promiscuity, but the data, though quite limited, points in favor of the above interpretation. By nature it is almost impossible to separate correlation and causation in a study like this, but the correlations are unambiguous: for instance, people who have more sexual partners report having unhappier marriages, and according to the Heritage Foundation, a woman’s number of previous sexual partners is positively correlated, in a linear manner, with the likelihood of acquiring an STD, getting divorced and becoming a single mother, as well as being negatively correlated with overall happiness. I strongly emphasize that I am not basing any of my conclusions upon these studies alone because of the huge confounds of socioeconomic status, age, underlying psychological disposition, religion and other factors. However, as Randall Munroe puts it, “correlation doesn’t imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively.” A more clear-cut example of the training effect of sex can be seen with the phenomenon of Internet porn. As hardcore pornography became cheap, anonymously accessible and ubiquitous, one would predict that growing numbers of young men — the chief user base — would begin to train themselves to be out of touch with real sex. This would lead to increased rates of erectile dysfunction among otherwise-normal young men, which is exactly what has been reported in the past few years according to the Journal of Sexual Medicine. Unlike hookups, pornography usage has been causally linked, in a series of studies from the 1980s, to all kinds of scary negative consequences, including enhanced belief in “sexual servitude” of women, decreased belief in faithfulness and increased acceptance of sexual assault. This demonstrates that sexual release is as potent a training device as hypothesized above: the manner in which one habitually experiences sex can cause wide-ranging psychological effects, even to the point of making real, physical sex no longer sufficiently arousing. So, what does all of this piecemeal evidence add up to? We have seen how casual sex could be a powerful mechanism with uncertain consequences and weak correlational evidence that backs this up. Further, we’ve noticed that in one domain, pornography, people’s ability to have real sex has been impaired by their own habits. In the same way that porn trains its users’ brains to seek out more voyeuristic, virtual sex, we can conclude that to some extent casual hookups train their participants to prefer unattached, uncommitted sex — a propensity that is incompatible with the long-term goal of family. The takeaway is not that we need a return to Victorian sexual mores or that the University should institute social codes. Rather, we as free adults need to recognize the incompatibility between our behavior on Thursday and Saturday nights and our eventual goals in life, at least for those who will want marriage and children. The training mechanism of sex is very powerful, and we can’t assume that some latent desire for commitment and family will sweep aside years or decades of habit formation “when we’re ready.” It would be unrealistic and counterproductive to try to make everyone avoid premarital sex, hookups or even pornography; there certainly is some value in experimenting to learn what you want out of life. But it is imperative to understand the potency of sex as a training mechanism and the long-term effects that it can have.|~|Steve Swanson is a Computer Science major from Vienna, Va.

82374|~|The way we speak|~|   April 1 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I’ve found myself frantically looking up slang terms in Urban Dictionary mid-conversation — discreetly on my phone — more frequently than I’ve had to look up a word in the Oxford English Dictionary. Though, it makes sense to refer to Urban Dictionary, which was started back in 1999 by none other than a college freshman. Nowadays slang is a natural part of the spoken word, and how we speak is constantly evolving. It can be hard to keep up. In fact, it can be so hard that even courtrooms are now referencing Urban Dictionary, according to The New York Times. Language reflects the changing needs of our society and our culture, which is why it is always evolving. According to the Linguistic Society of America, language is also a form of group identity, which is also dynamic. And the rise of texting, online chatting and social media is giving way to a new way of talking — or rather, virtually talking — altogether. But now slang isn’t a part of our language; it is our language. While the days of eloquent — and arguably convoluted — Shakespearean language may be long gone and justifiably so, we ascribe little value to language and how we talk, particularly in college. College has its own set of slang, and adopting “college-speak” becomes a necessary part of assimilating and fitting in, both linguistically and socially, as writer Mark Peters points out in GOOD Magazine. As linguistically enriching as neologisms may be, we have grown to underappreciate the value of a well-developed, diverse lexicon. Many professors at Princeton have even commented on papers urging the use of simpler language. Furthermore, not only have slang and “college-speak” come to dominate the way we speak, but we simply care more about what we want to say, rather than how we say it. Perhaps many of us have never given the way in which we speak a second thought. After all, spoken language is relaxed, informal speech that shouldn’t require more effort, and day-to-day conversations are the rare occasions when we aren’t under pressure to perform. Nonetheless, we have been desensitized to how we speak. Slang has become the norm to the point that on the occasion that someone does utter a slightly more obscure word, snarky comments such as “nice SAT vocabulary” will immediately follow. But what has been culturally popular is now taking root in our education system. Even the College Board has decided to take the SAT in a new direction in 2016, away from matching the letters of the correct archaic word to fit the sentence in the question. The new and improved exam will feature ‘”high utility’” words which will be of greater use to students on a daily basis and across a wide range of disciplines and contexts. Ben Zimmer, executive editor of Vocabulary.com, which seeks to expand people’s vocabularies, points out that though the SAT may be moving away from demanding students to know the definition of miscellaneous words and toward requiring them to use more commonplace words in various contexts, the SAT is not undermining the value of expanding one’s vocabulary. The only difference is that now there will be no higher SAT score waiting at the finish line, but rather a better command of language. As seemingly futile our efforts were as anxious high school students to learn as many obscure, obsolete words possible to pass the vocabulary section of the SAT, not all the words we learned or were tested on were irrelevant and inapplicable. Many of those words were — and continue to be — not only useful but simply striking elements of the English language. To many, if not most, a sophisticated lexicon implies pretension. People can be skeptical and condemning, and they perceive it as pointless. However, I see it differently. As Emerson said, words are so vascular that if you cut them, they’ll bleed, so we must appreciate language as a dynamic, living being. Language is what shapes politics, cultures, sciences and even entire civilizations, and we are dangerously close to losing sight of the value and intrinsic beauty of the spoken (and written) word. This applies to not just the English language, but to all languages. So I ask you to be more thoughtful of what words you use next time you strike up conversation, and you may just find that the conversation takes a whole different turn.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

Ranging in subject from issues of the environment to innovations in scientific research to social commentary, these speeches often offer a snapshot of the United States’ current state of being. One of the most talked-about talks in recent weeks was one given by Monica Lewinsky, famous for her affair with then-President Bill Clinton in the early 1990s, or, in her words, for having “taken wrong turns by falling in the love with the wrong person.” In the talk, Ms. Lewinsky broaches the subject of her experience in the wake of being branded as “that girl” with a candor that is striking in its courage. She then extrapolates outward to offer a critical look upon a society that perpetuates cycles of public humiliation. What interested me most within this video was also discussed in a piece Ms. Lewinsky wrote months before for Vanity Fair, in which she writes both to illuminate her personhood and to criticize the double standard that emerged in the wake of the White House investigation, which left her virtually isolated. As she so eloquently writes: “not lying low had exposed me to criticism for trying to ‘capitalize’ on my ‘notoriety.’ Apparently, others talking about me is O.K.; me speaking out for myself is not.” As Ms. Lewinsky discusses in the 18 minutes she spoke at the TED conference and in the rest of the Vanity Fair piece, there are a number of intertwining issues at hand. I encourage you all to read her op-ed or watch her talk, but what struck me as most salient was this idea of a single-faceted personhood and an inability to rectify that for oneself in a way that is very gendered. Much has been said about the heteronormative sexual double standard that persists in society and is intimately tied to the slut-shaming from which Ms. Lewinsky suffered. Men are expected to demonstrate their sexual prowess and are portrayed in the media as bragging about various “conquests”; women are cast in a pure, chaste role and must toe the line between being a “prude” or “bitch” (often because of an instance where she refused a man) and a “slut” or “whore.” This isn’t news to anyone, I’m sure. What needs to be considered alongside this troubling dynamic is this idea that many of the actions Ms. Lewinsky would have taken to move on with her life were cast in a way that implies her taking advantage of a situation, when in fact the media itself was doing just that to her. Countless other examples exist of such hypocrisy, perhaps the most notable next to Ms. Lewinsky herself being Kim Kardashian. A woman who in part owes her fame to a leaked sex tape, Kim has often been portrayed in a way that ignores her successful branding since. She has built an empire for herself, but that was largely ignored up until the point a successful man was attached to it; namely, Kanye. She became that “one good girl … worth a thousand bitches,” in the words of Kanye’s song “Bound 2,” where before she and her attempts to reconcile her personal sex tape’s wider distribution were cast in an unflattering, slut-shaming light. When people choose to try to knock her down a peg, then, they revert back to some of this rhetoric. Kanye himself perpetuates this trend for other women: he made comments saying that he needed to take “30 showers” after dating ex-girlfriend Amber Rose before he dated Kim, in part due to Rose’s past as a stripper. He implied this notion of “dirtiness” as one that derived from a woman’s general sexuality, deriding it when convenient, while conveniently forgetting about its hand in shaping his wife’s fame. In an age in which we see private information ranging from sex tapes to passport numbers leaked and available for consumption, it’s important to regain the consciousness of thought that recognizes those on the other end as more than just “that woman” (as Ms. Lewinsky was famously referred to by President Clinton) or “that man.” This is important not only with regard to public figures and how they play into or break traditional gender stereotypes, but how those we “know” or simply “know of” play into or break our own biases and how we react in turn. This could serve as a grassroots effort to combat many of these harmful, perpetuated notions not only pertaining to gender, but to race, class, age, etc. It obviously is not an answer, but one way to react in an age, to borrow Ms. Lewinsky’s phrasing, of “mass humiliation.”|~|Kelly Hatfield is a sophomore from Medford, Mass.

82172|~|A vicious cycle of weak civic engagement |~|   March 31 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Reva Abrol|~|   Contributor     |~|Last week, out of the hundreds of surveys for senior theses and university-sponsored initiatives that flooded my inbox (already filled with 1,915 unread messages and counting), I chose to complete the Pace Center Survey. Having participated in a student organization under the Pace Center for Civic Engagement last semester, I felt some small inclination to voice my grievances regarding the systematic lack of organization and general communal apathy toward strengthening Pace programs. Upon confronting the empty response boxes, I conjured up some banal phrases on the meaning of service in my life and hit Submit. There was little I could do to change what seemed to me an institutionalized indifference toward civic engagement on campus, and besides, I needed to finish my lab report. Weaknesses in Pace-sponsored service-oriented programs stem from a pervasive attitude on campus borne out of contrast to the administration’s emphasis on academic and professional success — that civic engagement just isn’t as important as everything else. In his 2014 article, Drew Stelljes, Assistant Vice President of The College of William and Mary, decries the failures of American universities in touting civic engagement centers to attract prospective donors without really teaching core civic skills. He urges universities to “linger in the hard work of community development, where engagement means, over the long-term graduating students who, by their example, help to fix the system that created our national conundrum.” Emphasis on community development, however, often takes the weakest roots in elite universities such as Princeton. The culture is set up so that teamwork inherently comes secondary to self-discipline. Academic policies such as the Honor Code, in making students accountable for themselves and for one another, unfortunately serve as deterrents to even good-spirited collaboration. Many departments discourage or even forbid group work, and in some departments, remnants of grade deflation policies persist, ultimately facilitating self-interested academic decision-making that often extends into the realm of social conduct. That is not to say that civic engagement does not exist at Princeton. Student organizations such as Engineers Without Borders and the GROW internship program under GlobeMed offer opportunities for students to aid in hands-on community development, and many students on campus regularly work on innovative social enterprises and start-ups with their peers, searching to channel their products or services toward community betterment. However, within institutionalized settings, collaborative energies are almost non-existent. As a result, the value we place on traditional forms of university-sponsored volunteer service, such as tutoring or hands-on service projects, seemingly diminishes. Part of the apathy toward strengthening community-centered programs then comes from the fact that members of student-run organizations under the Pace Center simply don’t have time. The overachiever culture at the University produces overextended students, who will logically allocate the little free time they have toward the activities they find most valuable. When the University fails to stress the importance of community development, it is up to the individual to decide what he or she most values, and since our market-driven culture often commends selfish decisions, he or she will likely choose something that furthers his or her own goals without much collateral benefit. Thankfully, there exist students on this campus who perform community service with altruistic intent and enable the survival of traditional volunteering projects. Still, social pressures to undertake activities that advance some academic or professional goal result in the further overextension of students. At the University, service is rarely ever the sole dedication of a student because making it so risks a weak and uncompetitive resume. Thus, a student who truly wants to engage civically is pushed to expand his or her extracurricular involvements to demonstrate a range of skill sets, and he or she becomes not only a volunteer for the Prison Teaching Initiative, but also a member of the Princeton Entrepreneurship Club, President of the Princeton Nassoons and Copy Editor of the Princeton Journal of East Asian Studies. To undertake volunteer service at the University among other extracurricular activities that do not carry traditional prestige requires some form of sincerity and commitment to the activity itself and not just to the image. Yet, when students in a prestige-driven university supplement such community service with more “impressive” extracurricular activities, leadership and member commitment to service-oriented programs degrades and the system of civic engagement is driven into decay. Such degradation triggers a vicious cycle, in which students participating in Pace programs become disillusioned by weak, uncommitted leadership and quit, leading programs into further degeneration. Civic involvement is often seen as secondary to everything else in creating the final package of a student and while it does serve as an enhancing factor, it is almost never the key factor itself. It is branded the flying buttress of Princeton architecture: beautiful and functional in some capacity, but rarely ever foundational. For institutionalized civic engagement opportunities to truly flourish, the administration must begin by encouraging a change in peer attitudes toward service from the top-down.|~|Reva Abrol is a freshman from Syosset, NY.

82220|~|At least we go to Princeton|~|   March 31 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Imani Thornton|~|   Contributing Columnist      |~|Each time I am faced with a roadblock, I feel barraged with this sentiment: “Well at least you go to Princeton”. On the surface level, this remark alone sounds rather extraordinary, especially this week, as high school students around the world learn if they’ve been accepted to  Princeton. Striding the same halls that world leaders (and Ted Cruz ’92) walked years ago, we too have obtained the chance to do remarkable things — and that is an incredible privilege. It is a humbling experience, and the first 83 times I was reminded of this privilege, it stuck with me as something to keep in mind during periods of academic struggle. But after the 84th time, I started wondering why I should take such pride in every aspect of the University — even things that seemed completely isolated from my own merit and achievements. As proud as I am to call the beautifully sculptured palaces dormitories and classrooms, I find it difficult to relate this honor with my own self-worth. Princeton accepted its students due to their merit, but should this knowledge alone alleviate the feelings of ineptitude that come with receiving a poor grade or failing an exam? In times like these, YikYak is a great place to turn for some consolation. Surprisingly, YikYak can do a rather quality job in uplifting spirits. Many times the humor alone — entirely unrelated to inspiration — is helpful. However, sometimes when the days are particularly rough, Yaks about squirrels just aren’t enough to get me pumped up again. In search of insight and wisdom, I eventually come across Yaks that resemble encouragement and inspiration or “Encouragement Yaks,” as I like to call them. Some “Encouragement Yaks” are meant to inspire a sense of caring and community, in the form of “There are people who love and care about you.” However, other Yaks attempt to encourage by reminding us of this: “If all else fails, just remember that we all got into Princeton!” This sentiment is expressed in a variety of forms and surely, these Yaks are not written solely for the purpose of other students. However, while I think it is helpful to remind ourselves of our place here, the general theme can quickly become rather suffocating. On several occasions, I have seen anonymous Yakkers express their discontent for campus, including how disappointed they are in the policies of the University and the attitudes of their peers. Instead of offering supportive advice or constructive comments, these expressions of “encouragement” are used to shut down conversation: “If you don’t like it, then leave”. While it is impossible to meet the needs of all students and many of the rigors of Princeton exist for good reason, I find it unsettling that those whom have less than positive things to say about Princeton are often bombarded with high levels of countenances. I applaud such school spirit; however, I think there is a rather fine line between Princeton pride and zealotry. As aforementioned, Princeton is probably one of the best things that has, is, and will ever happen to me, and I realize that. But if I ever happen to express aloud that I don’t like how the trees are shaped or how the administration operates, the default response should not be: “But at least you got into Princeton!” Instead, I hope to see an increased advocacy for combating the real and expressed issues that students face, either offline or online. These solutions will not come easily but that does not mean they should be nudged aside with sentiments suggesting one should be thankful just to be here. We should not mistake loyalty for blind acceptance of Princeton’s problems. Princeton is a great place, but it is far from perfect. If it ever has a chance of being a utopian bliss, pretending that it already is will never get us there.|~|Imani Thornton is a freshman from Matteson, Ill.

82170|~|The decision to vote for divestment|~|   March 31 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|In the recent Israeli elections, hope for productive negotiations with Palestinians was dealt a serious blow. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out definitively against the two-state solution as a means to solidify his support on the Israeli right wing, then rode his public insistence on an indefinite military occupation of the West Bank to victory. Despite two-faced attempts to recover the Obama administration’s confidence, the re-elected Prime Minister’s stance has been made clear: he is in no way committed to achieving a peaceful end to the illegal military occupation. Netanyahu’s credibility to negotiate in good faith was further eroded by racialized remarks warning that Arab voters were going to the polls “in droves,” aimed at stoking fear — and electoral turnout — among his base. In view of this bleak political reality, additional measures to get Israelis and Palestinians to the table are required. Last fall, over 700 members of the university community signed a statement calling on the University to divest from all multinational corporations that contribute to or profit from the illegal military occupation of the Palestinian territories. Pointing to the half-century of international law violations, the globally condemned onslaughts against the blockaded Gaza Strip, the continued expansion of West Bank settlements in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the military occupation’s ongoing egregious human and civil rights violations, this Princeton coalition rallied around the idea that our university endowment should not finance corporations that abet these injustices. We previously laid out the case for divestment as a necessary and effective tool to achieve a lasting peace in the region, without which the peace process will only continue to flounder. Following elections, the cause of divestment is more urgent than ever. Absent our demanding as a global citizenry that international humanitarian law be upheld, Netanyahu’s campaign decree opposing the creation of a Palestinian state will be realized. To actualize our commitments to basic principles of human rights, a diverse alliance of students and organizations have come together as the Princeton Divests Coalition to bring a divestment referendum before the entire undergraduate body. Our referendum calls on the University to divest from multinational corporations that maintain the illegal infrastructure of the occupation, facilitate Israel’s and Egypt’s collective punishment of civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip or facilitate state repression against civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by Israeli, Egyptian or Palestinian Authority security forces. To name but a few examples, Caterpillar supplies bulldozers that demolish Palestinian homes and olive orchards to make way for segregated settlements. Combined Systems, Inc., makes the tear gas used to repress peaceful demonstrators in the West Bank (and Ferguson and Tahrir Square), sometimes causing deaths and abortions from exposure. Hewlett Packard produces the identification cards restricting Palestinians’ freedom of movement based on their race and religion, plus the biometric scanning technology tracking these civilians through military checkpoints between home, work and school. Divestment from human rights-abusing corporations should not be controversial. The endowment is as much a part of the University as our campus itself, and we are as ethically responsible for its stewardship as we are for our health facilities and laboratories. Maintaining the status quo, in which the University financially supports an illegal military occupation, is not a position of neutrality. Rather, we currently facilitate collective punishment against a civilian population and enable disregard for a lawful international order when our endowment could instead be constructively invested elsewhere. It is incumbent upon the University to link its mission as an educational institution — fostering both students’ intellectual and moral development — to the ethics of its own conduct, on campus and off. To dismiss the question of divestment as “political” constitutes a grave failure in preparing Princetonians to act in the service of all nations beyond the Orange Bubble. Divestment is the most direct and effective lever at the University’s disposal to bring positive change on the ground. Other universities nationwide, recently including Northwestern and Stanford, have passed resolutions to divest from corporations complicit in human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories, and more are on the way. Princeton could be the first Ivy League university to endorse divestment, galvanizing the larger movement to halt the illegal military occupation. In this respect, we can choose between acting now as a leading example for our peer institutions, or waiting to become followers. We as members of the Princeton University community are committed to ensuring our endowment does not prolong an illegal military occupation responsible for systematic human rights violations since 1967 and to doing what we can to promote peace and justice around the world. While we do not necessarily profess to speak for these organizations as a whole, our respective affiliations inform a common commitment to democracy and freedom for all. Divestment is an important step in that direction. We urge the Princeton undergraduate student body to call for integrity and consistency between our words and actions, and when that time comes, for the University to heed our appeal.

82046|~|A most relevant monk|~|   March 30 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|It’s a weekly event: a world leader is coming to Princeton’s campus! Insert illustrious title, sponsoring department, a moderator with a doctorate and a time and place to be there. Email lists are accurately alerted; details are scribbled or typed into calendars. In his article “The Problem With Prestige” for the Nassau Weekly, Dayton Martindale questions our immediate instinct to line up for the old and the famous. We love snagging an orange ticket for Supreme Court Justices and big business leaders and past Presidents or Prime Ministers. They speak of their time (usually at an Ivy League or elite institution) and their career path that lead them to a title with capitalized letters. His Holiness the 17th Karmapa will speak on Wednesday. I lined up at noon when tickets became available, but was surprised to find that not all had been claimed. Perhaps you have not heard of the Karmapa. His full name is Ogyen Drodul Trinley Dorje the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa, and depending on the decision of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama on whether or not to reincarnate, will ostensibly be the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. His title of “Karmapa” means “the one who carries out Buddha-activity” or “the embodiment of all the activities of the buddhas.” And he is only 29 years old. The Karmapa leads hundreds of thousands of Buddhists in Tibet, in exile and around the world. In March alone, he spoke at Stanford University, the University of Redlands and Harvard Divinity School to sold-out audiences of students, faculty and members of the Tibetan diaspora. The Karmapa has neither PhD nor political title, but neither of these deficiencies detracts from his remarkable life story. Recognized at seven years old as His Holiness the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa, as a fourteen year old he trekked by car, foot, horseback and helicopter from Tsurphu, Tibet to Dharmsala, India where he was granted refugee status. Since his journey, he has been both an active teacher and student. In addition to his monastic training, he studies science and English, wrote and produced a six-act play, founded an initiative to turn monasteries into centers for environmental sustainability, and launched an effort to establish full ordination of women within Tibetan Buddhist tradition. One might call it a “nontraditional career path;” the Karmapa has led a rich life of diverse leadership experiences, and, if you believe, he also has the wisdom of sixteen lives already lived. Damaris Miller ’15 is especially looking forward to the Karmapa’s talk, as she will be beginning a Labouisse Prize-funded independent project to work with Khoryug, the Karmapa’s environmental advocacy initiative. “We [Princeton students] go see people because they have expertise. What’s cool about receiving the Karmapa’s teachings is that it’s not just intellectual or familiar; it’s challenging you to consider and reflect upon the ways you are living. And to actually live them, not just to understand the differences.” Of course, students might flock to Supreme Court justices because they are interested in law or the life path of the person, but mostly, I posit, we fill the seats of Richardson so we can listen to the elite and figure out their brilliance; they just might reveal the secrets of their successes. We bring our notebooks and laptops and full attention spans in order to absorb how best to emulate those who have paved the way before us. We trust that those with extensive years in the most maximized positions of society will tell decode the mysteries of politics or business when really, in general, they just offer sound bytes that we’ve already read. I challenge Princeton to consider the Karmapa as equally and immediately important in our everyday lives as any President. None of us will lead a life quite like the Karmapa (there are no Tibetan undergraduate students currently at Princeton, according to a map analysis by Nihar Madhavan ’15), but that does not mean his extraordinary life path cannot be relevant to our lives as students. Perhaps the best secrets to success will be dressed in this monk’s maroon robes: prioritizing a talk on kindness, activism and morality surely has resonance for students wanting to lead happy, productive lives. Recently, the Karmapa gave a talk at the TED India conference where he spoke about connecting mind to mind and heart to heart. He told the story of a meeting with a delegation from Afghanistan and their discussion on the Taliban bombing at Bamiyan, the site of two 1,700-year-old statues of Lord Buddha. One would imagine the young monk might foster some resentment, but instead he said, “The bomb was just a depletion of matter, and maybe we can look at it like the falling of the Berlin wall. Maybe we can see it as a start of open communication — we can always look for a way to find something positive.” I have certainly enjoyed lectures from the famous politicians and lawyers and writers and scientists to which Princeton gives us access. But why not open our minds to the idea that the leader of the Tibetan people might be equally interesting? We seek ideas we have previously sought, of the men and women we aspire to be. There is nothing wrong with that. However, Princeton is a place to expand our minds and absorb alternate perspectives — it is therefore essential that we not only listen to the people whose names grace our news headlines, but listening to people we didn’t think we wanted to listen to.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

82052|~|The Call|~|   March 30 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Colter Smith|~|   Contributor     |~|This January, Duke University had planned to begin broadcasting the Adhan, a traditional Muslim call to prayer, from the top of their chapel on Fridays in an effort to help create a more welcoming environment for Muslim students and foster community unity. The effort backfired when students, alumni and others lashed out at the university for this decision. In response to student backlash, the university changed its plans. Instead, the University broadcasted the call to prayer from the quadrangle in front of the chapel rather than the chapel tower itself. Duke buckling down under pressure represents a major failure on the part of Duke in two capacities. Firstly, it represents a failure of the Duke community to come together to support people of all creeds. Secondly, and more shamefully in my opinion, it represents a failure on the part of the University, which should aim to create a community tolerable to all rather than easily give in to such bigoted calls. This decision by Duke lets its Muslim community, and to some degree the whole American Muslim community, believe they are unwelcome, and that those who are meant to protect them from this kind of bigotry will not do so. As I don’t like to make assumptions about my readers, I’d like to take a moment to explain why broadcasting the Adhan is in no way supporting “raping, butchering and beheading Christians, Jews, and anyone who doesn’t submit to their Sharia Islamic law,” as Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, mentioned in Facebook post. Close to a quarter of the world’s population is Muslim. With such a large population, there are bound to be a fair number of bad eggs. Whatever the number is, it represents only the tiniest of fractions of the global Muslim population. The vast majority of Muslims are simply everyday people trying to make a living while maintaining a peaceful coexistence with those around them. The fact that there exists some who would do wrong in the name of Islam does not mean that Islam is a poison. To declare that all of Islam is bad because of the deplorable acts of a few would be no different than to declare that all of Christianity is bad because of the acts of the members of the homophobic, funeral-picketing Westboro Baptist Church. In fact, the Church’s most pervasive time, the Dark Ages, was also Christianity’s most belligerent, and countless atrocities have been made in the name of the cross as well as in the name of most other religions. The issue isn’t these religions, but rather those bad people who wield and corrupt them. Duke did wrong, and I believe that we should take it upon ourselves to step in where Duke failed. It is my belief that Princeton should begin sounding the Muslim call to prayer once a week on Fridays from the top of our own chapel. The prayer wouldn’t be too loud, only audible in the immediate vicinity so as to not disturb student life. This proposition has two purposes. The first is to help the Muslim community on campus feel that their religious beliefs are being respected, supported and welcomed. The second is so that this University, by virtue of its international standing, may not only raise awareness of injustice, but also act as a beacon of tolerance for others across the country and the world. In the past decade, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and other radical Muslim groups have taught a philosophy of hate. They tell the world that their religion is the only way, labeling all others as abhorrent. They preach that religions and creeds they do not support must be stamped from this earth. If we allow ourselves to succumb to religious intolerance, then we are no better than they are. This university is looked upon and respected by many. If we wish to live in a world of tolerance, let us lead by example. If we wish to live in a world free from those who would do evil in order to rid their lands of those they do not worship with, then let us demonstrate to all that this land, our land, will never be such a land; that our land will forever serve as a beacon of hope and light and tolerance. Let us take up the call, to prayer and to unity by giving a voice to those who have been silenced elsewhere.|~|Colter Smith is a sophomore from Bronxville, NY.

82058|~|Keep OA/CA voluntary|~|   March 30 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Lavinia Liang|~|   Contributor     |~|My gals and I went down to Florida two weeks ago to escape cloudy New Jersey. These were all friends that I had made on Community Action, the pre-orientation program that, along with Outdoor Action, is designed to help freshmen transition more easily into their first year. We were a part of the Arts team which stayed in Trenton, and in our group we’d had painters, writers, musicians, singers and dancers, among others. It was quite the collection, and an eclectic one at that. Sometimes I am surprised that we still remain so close this far into the school year — close enough to band together, fly out together, beach bum together, cook together and eat ice cream together on balconies nearing midnight. I am not the only one. Several times we would muse and laugh together about our joint summer escapades — remember X on CA? Remember when Y did this or that? I’ve been told that “first semester friends often don’t last.” I personally was afraid that academic and extracurricular interests would begin to dictate my friendships during the school year. So we were all surprised and happy that this spring break trip, which we had been planning for a while, had actually happened. It was funny because our vacation reminded us of what we had done on Community Action (except without the community action, of course.) During our Florida stay, most of us filled out the CA leader application. Collectively we were annoyed at the question which asked “What do you hope to gain?” (“We don’t hope to gain anything, really. Smiles on the freshmen’s faces?”) Collectively we compared our answers to the “Why do you want to be a CA leader?” question, afraid that ours would all be too similar. “We loved CA,” was our consensus, “And we want other freshmen to have a positive transition, too.” In preemptive response to any sort of proposals to make pre-orientation mandatory, I believe that this move would completely annihilate the optional and flexible nature of such programs, which would in turn harm the purpose of CA and OA as voluntary opportunities for students to meet their peers. From a leadership standpoint, this would also be dangerous. While both OA and CA programs would suffer, I — and my friends — personally fear the worst for CA. It might be a generalization; it might even be a slippery slope. Regardless, OA has earned a fearsome reputation among incoming classes, with stories of no showers (and nightly rains in their stead.) This deterrent could cause overflow freshmen — freshmen who wanted to do neither OA nor CA — to flood the latter. “I sure as heck don’t want (extra) disengaged frosh,” my friend shared with me gloomily. In the class of 2018, 706 students participated in OA and 170 students participated in CA out of a class of 1314. These applications were accepted on a first come-first serve basis, and there were also students who ended up doing neither. Making OA/CA mandatory would affect both programs in a negative way by bringing in students who possibly do not want to be involved so early. However, I believe that mandatory pre-orientation would be more concerning for CA. Community Action is a week full of community service. Service is something that is inherently optional and cannot be forced upon volunteers. Even with the Outdoor Action program — which does not involve service — as a buffer, Community Action is likely to become a very different program than the one my friends and I participated in. Another of our friends, who had done OA, happened to be in the Fort Myers area this spring break, and she stopped by one day to picnic with us. We talked about our pre-orientation experiences and she said that she still hung out regularly with a couple of girls from her group. As we sat and ate our homemade burgers and salad, commending our leaders on their doing this very same kind of cooking for us — for a whole week — we all understood that there was a special connection that held us together. Something, also, had held our friend to the OA friends she still spent time with. There was the important undertone that all of us had done this willingly, we selected certain interests and consciously threw ourselves together and hoped for the best. I know that I, for one, am now blessed to have some of my best friends in the world.|~|Lavinia Liang is a freshman from Poughkeepsie, NY. She can be reached at lavinial@princeton.edu.

81886|~|Why does #WeSpeak matter?|~|   March 29 2015|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|The Footnotes are in. diSiac is in. International Relations Council is in. Your roommate is in. And we’re in. We’re taking the WeSpeak survey this week because sexual violence at Princeton matters. It isn’t a women’s issue. It isn’t a Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources and Education issue. It’s a Princeton issue. When anyone on this campus is a victim of sexual violence, our community suffers. When anyone on this campus commits an act of violence, our community must ask what more we could have done to prevent it and how best to serve justice. Sexual violence is coming to matter more and more on college campuses nationwide. In Congress, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York has condemned a nationwide “epidemic” of sexual assault. Princeton was under federal investigation for four years; last fall the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights released a resolution agreement which included new reforms to Princeton’s policies and practices that would put Princeton back into compliance with Title IX. The issue has been covered extensively in the media, from The Daily Show’s witty puncture of the myth of false reporting of sexual violence to The Wall Street Journal’s recent story on lawsuits young men have filed against their universities for a disciplinary process they felt was prejudiced against them. It’s clear that sexual violence is a contentious issue here at Princeton and nationwide. There is a wide array of views and arguments to be made, and Princeton’s policies need to attend to this wide range of concerns. WeSpeak is a crucial chance for students to tell the truth of their experience and to guide the policy decisions that the survey data will inform. Every thinking and feeling person would agree that one incident of sexual assault is one too many. The question is: Where is Princeton starting from as we all work together toward a campus culture that reflects that agreement? Here are some dramatic numbers you may recognize from the “Dear Colleague” letter published in April 2011: On college campuses nationwide, one in five women are sexually assaulted or escape an attempted assault. For men, it’s one in 17. For our own campus, data from a American College Health Association assessment found that one in nine Princeton undergraduates experiences some form of interpersonal violence in a 12-month period. You may also recall a 2013 ‘Prince’ article on the results of a 2008 survey in which 1 in 6 female undergraduates reported experiencing non-consensual vaginal penetration during their time at Princeton. However, in all these previous surveys on our campus and others, only a small percentage of students participated. This means the full community was not represented. With low rates of participation, there’s no way to know if the incidence of sexual misconduct was underreported or overreported. With WeSpeak, the University hopes to collect and publish the results of one of the most representative surveys on this issue nationwide, results that reflect all of our experiences and opinions. You may personally feel that the pervasiveness of sexual misconduct on college campuses has been grossly exaggerated. You may believe that our own University has been far too tolerant of a pervasive rape culture. Or your feelings may lie somewhere in between. Unfortunately, no one knows the complete picture. And we won’t until we get everyone’s input. The WeSpeak survey is designed to answer two big questions: First, what are students’ attitudes toward sexual misconduct? Do students think it’s a problem on campus? Do students talk about what consent means — that yes means yes? Do students know where on campus victims and their allies can seek help, and where any student can learn more about how to talk to their partners about what they want and don’t want? Second, what is the prevalence of sexual misconduct — of any kind — in this campus community? Sexual misconduct is notoriously underreported to campus authorities nationwide and for many complex reasons. But the data from this survey can help Princeton better address two of those reasons. First, some students may not trust the University’s disciplinary process to take care of them or their friends when they have been assaulted, harassed or stalked. Second, some students may not trust the disciplinary process to reach a decision that is fair to the respondent (the person accused). We believe that every Princeton student deserves a community that is safe, inclusive, and just. We all need to know where we’re starting from as we build toward that goal over the next few years. We want to be part of a campus known for having great sex, the kind that both partners can feel good about the next day. We want to be part of a culture of prevention where we look out for each other when the night gets crazy, a culture where people talk with their partners about what they each want and what they’re just not into, a culture of respect where there is no substitute for a clear, enthusiastic yes. The University needs to know what students have experienced to find out what obstacles stand in the way of the culture we all deserve.

81909|~|Editorial: Offering historical tours|~|   March 29 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|The Continental Army fired cannonballs at Nassau Hall during the Battle of Princeton, and Albert Einstein taught in what is now the Frist Campus Center. These moments in Princeton history figure prominently in the typical Orange Key campus tour attended by many undergraduates when they were prospective students. Less well-known is that the world’s first telegraph line was set up between Joseph Henry’s Princeton home and his laboratory in the University’s Philosophical Hall or that Pete Conrad ’53, commander of Apollo 12, brought small Princeton flags to the moon in November 1969. Currently, no outlet for sharing these aspects of Princeton lore with interested Princeton students, community members and other campus visitors exists. To address this programming gap, the Editorial Board proposes that Orange Key creates and advertises a weekly Historical Tour focused on Princeton’s architecture, history and traditions.  Furthermore, we recommend the Admission Office offer tours of this nature during the upcoming Princeton Preview days for admitted students and their families. Orange Key offers admissions tours throughout the year that anyone may join without pre-registration. Only groups of 10 or more need to pre-register with the admissions office and when they do so they may indicate that they would like their tour to have a historical focus, which is primarily done by groups of adults from outside organizations. However, this option is not advertised on the the office’s website. At a minimum, the website should state that historical tours are available upon request so interested groups know to take advantage of this opportunity.  Yet this still does not meet the needs of individual community members or visitors in smaller groups who may be interested in Princeton’s history. While these individuals may attend a regular Orange Key campus tour, according to Orange Key’s Guide for Guides, any tour that has at least one prospective student must focus on Princeton’s academics and student life. Therefore, the Board proposes the development of regularly scheduled Historical Tours that include information about the history, architecture, and traditions of many locations on campus beyond just Nassau Hall (the primary historical focus of current Orange Key tours). We recommend offering such a tour once or twice a week and advertising it on the admissions website as open to any members of the public and University students. Finally, we propose that the Historical Tour be offered during Princeton Preview for prospective students and in particular for their parents or siblings who may have already taken the regular Orange Key tour (which will be offered during Preview) and want a new option for Preview. There is great value in regularly providing such Historical Tours. For residents of Princeton and surrounding areas, they may learn more about the University with which they share a home. Providing community members with greater access to the University fosters improved town-gown relationships, which is always in the University’s interest as it seeks to continue its positive collaboration with the town of Princeton. For students, education need not end in the classroom, and creating an environment rich in learning experiences is one of the University’s goals. That current campus tours focus in part on historical facts demonstrates that Orange Key and the admissions office share our belief that such information is of interest to campus visitors and important to be shared. We urge the University to provide an additional educational opportunity for interested students and the 700,000 people who visit Princeton each year by instituting regularly scheduled Historical Tours and making this an option for Princeton Preview activities.

81883|~|Endowment spending|~|   March 29 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Several reports in the past year have rightfully pointed out that Princeton (along with Stanford, Yale and Harvard) earns enough in investment returns on its endowment each year to more than cover annual operating expenses (with significant amounts of money left over to spend on capital projects or put back into the endowment) and that the University could therefore make tuition 100 percent free for everyone and still make a massive profit. By the numbers, Princeton’s annual rate of return on endowment investment has been between 15 and 20 percent for the past few years, and has averaged, 10.5 percent per year over the last 10 years (a period that includes the worst financial crisis in modern times). Last year, the 19.6 percent return equated to $2.8 billion, and in future years a similar rate would yield an even higher absolute number. Princeton’s Provost David Lee GS ’99 put the point of this growth best, saying on the University website that it was “crucial to our ability to sustain the excellence of our teaching and research mission and to continue providing generous financial aid that makes Princeton”s education affordable to any student who is admitted.” Thus one of the explicitly stated missions of the enormous investment machine Princeton runs is to make Princeton affordable to its students (the quote above even originally linked to the Undergraduate Financial Aid website). By contrast, Princeton’s operating budget has been roughly $1.6 billion per year over the past few years, and it grows at a much slower rate than the endowment does. In raw terms, then, assuming an average endowment growth rate of 10 percent (which is very conservative and assumes that a Great Recession-level drop in the endowment will happen far more frequently than it ever has), the University can cover its operating expenses exclusively off endowment returns, and still have over 40 percent of the endowment returns to reinvest. The University could, to use last year’s numbers, put $1.6 billion of the $2.8 billion in endowment returns to entirely pay off all operating costs, and still have more than a billion dollars leftover to reinvest into the endowment or use on one-time capital projects like new facilities. And as a nice side-effect of that spending plan, none of us would owe a dime in tuition, room and board or fees. The benefit to students of this plan seems obvious — students and parents alike would have more money in online casino  the present, and wouldn’t be saddled with loans that take decades to pay off. But this system also has some key benefits for the University that merit attention. The first and most obvious is competitiveness in admissions. Princeton continues to enjoy record-breaking admissions numbers nearly every year, and is at no shortage of applicants. Yet it continuously lags far behind Harvard and Yale in admissions yield (the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll). An easy, dramatic and incredibly effective way Princeton could make itself far more attractive relative to other schools is by becoming free seemingly overnight. (Note: Harvard, Yale and Stanford could also afford to become free, though by a much smaller margin and are therefore less likely to do so). A talented, sought-after student admitted to multiple schools, trying to decide which one to attend, is going to be far more likely to come to Princeton over its competitors if his or her family won’t be saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills. Beyond raising Princeton’s yield immediately, a free Princeton education would also reap more in alumni donations. The endowment would grow more slowly if this system were in place (since roughly 60 percent of the growth in the endowment wouldn’t be put back into it), but part of the decrease in endowment size would be offset by increased alumni donations. Instead of alumni having to pay off student loans (with interest) to banks (as both Michelle Obama ’85 and Ted Cruz ’92 have admitted to doing, and most of us will never be as rich as either of them), they could instead afford to give (more) money to Princeton. Additionally, young alumni who aren’t saddled with debt have more money to use in starting a new business or pursuing graduate school, both of which can lead to much higher salaries and net worths over the course of their careers. It should go without saying that a richer alumni network will give more to their cherished Old Nassau, especially one that gave them the incredible and unique gift of a free college education. By taking financial aid to its extreme (but financially viable) conclusion and making Princeton free for all of its students, the University can become an even more attractive option for the talented students we recruit, and can leave its students and alumni free of an enormous burden that allows them to more fully realize their career potential.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

81780|~|Does the P/D/F option dissuade learning and exploration?|~|   March 26 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Avaneesh Narla|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|On Sunday, the Editorial Board wrote an editorial encouraging the University to adopt measures relating to the current pass/D/fail policy. While I don’t believe that the measures promoted by the Board are necessarily the best solution to the issue, I believe that the University’s P/D/F policy for undergraduates needs to change in order for the University to truly promote its ideals as a center of liberal arts education and an institution of scholarly exploration. While “P/D/F”-ing a class is a great option for those who wish to explore a field but fear that a bad grade might hurt their future goals, it also leads to a very common narrative: students are often no longer incentivized to engage in the class. Most students recognize the significant difference between the effort required to pass a course and the effort required to get a good grade. The question of whether or not one will P/D/F a class becomes a strategic one: students often find that P/D/F-ing a class will enable them to focus on and perform better in their other classes. While ideally students would continue to put effort into their P/D/F class (and their intention may be to do so), due to the pressures of other classes, P/D/F classes often take a backseat. Having the P/D/F deadline midway through the semester means that students are participating minimally in a class for almost half a semester, as once they declare P/D/F, they resign themselves to the least amount of work required to pass a class. This is harmful for everybody participating in the class with them: students, instructors and preceptors. In fact, there is vast literature (An Evaluation of Pass/Fail in Princeton and A National Evalution of Pass/Fail) in post-secondary pedagogy documenting the large drop in performance and change in attitudes due to the P/D/F option. Further, students may find that they are performing better than they expected. Some classes consider only one piece of assessment for the reported midterm grades, which is not indicative of the student’s final performance in the class. Often, students find that they are P/D/F-ing a class they enjoy and could do well in, but are not receiving due credit for any additional effort beyond the minimal. I believe that it is imperative that the administration reconsider its P/D/F policy after collection of student and faculty feedback. I have outlined a few of the possible changes (extending upon those proposed by the Editorial Board), but hope that they are criticized and developed upon, and that other modifications emerge and are considered. One modification that would likely be met with positive feedback by students would be to push the deadline for electing the P/D/F option until later in the semester, for example allowing for electing a P/D/F grade after receiving the final grade, as proposed by the Editorial Board. This will ensure incentive to engage in the class throughout, but may pose its own problems. Other possible deadlines include after the final exam but before receiving a grade, after the last week of classes and possibly even course-specific P/D/F deadlines decided on by the instructor. Variations of these deadlines exist in universities across the country and around the world, and often act as fail-safes in case the student finds that they were not able to perform adequately in a class due to illness or other circumstances. Many may argue that having the deadline after receiving the grade would make the Pass grade equivalent to a C, but isn’t that already the case? Undergraduates currently P/D/F a class because they believe it would significantly lower their GPA. Students would still not be able to PDF most classes, and most importantly all departmental requirements. Thus, the GPA would still be relevant, but the hope of a good grade would incentivise further exploration. Another modification, albeit an unpopular one, would be to make the requirements to pass a course more stringent. Currently, according to the University’s grading policy, a pass grade reflects that the final work is at least “acceptable, while falling short of meeting basic standards in several ways.” The requirements could be raised so that the work reflects a higher standard of learning, which would force a student to engage in the class more. However, this could dissuade students from exploring and tighten the spectrum of grades, and thus increase competition. I’m no proponent for fear as a motivator (despite its pedagogical benefits), but I recognize the benefits this alternative modification could present. As a proponent of the liberal arts curriculum, the University should reflect on the practicality of the P/D/F option and gather relevant feedback from all members of the community. While no particular modifications seem obvious, the University must not believe that the policy as it is now is successful in encouraging scholarly exploration in diverse fields.|~|Avaneesh Narla is a sophomore from Calcutta, India.

81776|~|On complaining|~|   March 26 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Julia Case-Levine|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In the midst of a frazzled rant, a friend interrupted me to ask, “Is this making you feel any better?” Walking through campus, I had been poring over a seemingly endless list of upcoming projects, assignments and other miscellaneous problems I proclaimed simply could not be solved. Now we were eating lunch, and I had not touched my food or taken my jacket off. I had walked into the Butler/Wilson dining hall, sat down and, without taking a breath, delved right back into my tirade. I grew up in a house where we talked about everything: what we ate for breakfast, what we ate for lunch, how we felt about said meals. Nothing was off limits. And, in the interest of not “bottling things up,” perhaps there was an inclination to dwell on meaningless difficulties. I’m not alone in my partiality to self-pity; a cursory glance at Yik Yak reveals a campus penchant for commiserating. From senior thesis woes to midterm miseries, complaints amass. There is no doubt that talking about our problems is crucial. Certainly, nobody should feel pressure to present a perfect front when things are far from alright. Forcing ourselves to disguise and conceal our problems does not make them disappear, and sometimes, just reading about others’ trials is soothing, reminding us of a larger, complicated and problem-filled world around us. A psychological study published in the Journal of Social Psychology examines the benefits of whining — if done right. According to the study, if complainers focus on how their problems can be positively resolved, rather than simply on what the problems are, complaining can be a constructive activity. “Perhaps people who are more mindful modulate the type of complaints they offer, preferring to engage in instrumental types of complaints over expressive complaints, thereby expressing complaints only when they believe they will accomplish desired outcomes,” the study says. However, as psychiatrist Eric Berne writes in “Games People Play,” sometimes complaining is not about seeking advice and aiming to improve a situation. Sometimes complaining is satisfying simply because of the sympathy it solicits. Sometimes we just want people to commiserate with us, to validate our feelings and give us the right to be upset. Furthermore, group commiseration can be bonding. One reason my family is close is certainly because we are able to share freely. So, perhaps my ranting should have been a source of great relief. Whether it be in communally constructing a plan to tackle my problems or in soliciting sympathy, the virtues of complaining seem to abound. And yet, despite all of this, when my friend asked if our conversation was making me feel better, I answered “No.” No, discussing all of my assorted problems was not satisfying. Instead of feeling release, feeling my problems dissipate and dissolve by naming and sharing them, I felt weighed down and exhausted by our chat. Research on teenage “co-rumination” found that individuals who spend time rehashing and revisiting problems without making any progress in tackling them are likely to experience emotional consequences. According to the study, “Because co-rumination involves a perseverative focus on the details of problems, it also may cause problems to seem more significant and harder to resolve. This could lead to more worries and concerns about problems and associated anxiety symptoms.” Continually returning to the same unresolved problems can be exhausting, as well as anxiety and depression-inducing. Obsessively discussing the same things and dwelling on the same complaints and concerns can enlarge our problems and get us stuck in a slump instead of preparing us to effectively confront challenges. The adverse effects of this negative mindset can potentially spread to our friends. Research shows that negative attitudes and anxiety are contagious; dwelling on our problems draws our friends into the same patterns. While sharing is an important part of any relationship, there is a balance to strike between addressing problems and letting these problems define us. Some problems are solvable; sometimes when we seek assistance from parents and peers we get meaningful advice. But, sometimes, discussing stress only begets more stress. If we find ourselves talking about the same thing over and over again with no desirable outcome in sight, it may be  time to change the subject.|~|Julia Case-Levine is a freshman from New York, N.Y.

81778|~|Editorial: Reducing waste in Campus Dining|~|   March 26 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Campus Dining is managed with remarkable skill and efficiency. Even while serving thousands of students, staff and visitors each day, the award-winning residential dining program makes it a priority to offer nutritious and sustainable menus. The retail dining system, meanwhile, provides quality services in a number of easily accessible locations. However, there is still significant room for improvement, specifically in the area of waste reduction. The University could do much in the way of small adjustments to dining operations in order to promote financial and environmental efficiency. To that end, the Editorial Board offers two proposals. First, Campus Dining should gradually reduce the size of plates in the residential dining halls. Second, make the Princeton University water bottles currently sold in Frist Campus Center ineligible for the Late Meal allowance. The plates currently utilized in the dining halls are generally quite large. While this may appeal to the appetites of a few particularly ravenous students, it is not conducive to an efficient use of resources. People eating in the dining halls will naturally fill their plates with food but, because the plates are excessively large, will usually only eat a portion of their meal. Thus, people consistently take too much food and dispose of the excess. The Board recommends reducing plate size to encourage diners to take less food and thereby reduce waste. In doing so, the University would very easily decrease its financial burdens regarding the purchase of food as well as the disposal of excess waste. Furthermore, the costs associated with a reduction in plate size could be kept at a minimum through careful planning by simply waiting until a regularly scheduled purchase date to introduce a new set of smaller plates rather than discarding all the current plates immediately. Campus Dining could further reduce waste by removing bottled water from the products covered by the Late Meal allowance in Frist. Presently, the Food Gallery offers Princeton University water bottles as a product covered by the Late Meal credit allowance afforded to all students with a meal plan. Because it is covered by the Late Meal allowance, students have no reason not to purchase bottled water. Indeed, far too many University water bottles are purchased by students seeking to use the entirety of their Late Meal allowance. This allowance was designed to provide an alternative meal time to students with demanding class schedules, but the availability of bottled water during Late Meal only fuels waste and environmental harm. The situation is made worse by the presence of many water fountains and bottle filling stations around campus. Rather than encouraging the student body to utilize these fountains and stations, current retail dining policies simply encourage unnecessary waste. To remedy this problem, the University’s retail dining services should no longer offer bottled waters as a product covered by the Late Meal allowance. In addition, the University should supplement this change by expanding the number of bottle filling stations around campus. There are multiple major buildings without such amenities, notably East Pyne and Robertson Hall, and decreasing this number would incentivize students to use refillable bottles instead of purchasing and discarding numerous University water bottles. Dining hall tendencies and Late Meal purchases are an important part of the University student’s daily life. In order to improve its efficiency, both in a financial and environmental sense, the University ought to reduce plate size and remove bottled water as a product eligible for a Late Meal swipe. Doing so would also make for a more pleasant dining experience and a more sustainable campus overall. For these reasons, the Board strongly urges the University administration to adopt these proposals.  Allison Berger ’18, Connor Pfeiffer ’18, and Theodore Furchtgott ’18 abstained from this editorial.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of The Daily Princetonian.

As the dean of a residential college, I can assure you that our immediate thoughts and actions that sad day were about all of the students who were going to be affected by this tragedy. I spent much of the afternoon and well into the evening writing to students to let them know that they should be with their friends and Audrey’s friends that night and not be writing papers for Dean’s Date. I know my fellow deans, directors of studies and directors of student life were doing the same. Many of us couldn’t come to the memorial that night because we were in our offices letting professors know that papers and assignments were not going to be completed. We all understood that, at that moment, we didn’t want students to choose between mourning and schoolwork. Our grief as a community came first. There might be other points in Eileen’s essay, such as how we communicate to the outside world when such a tragedy occurs, that were valid. But to imply that administrators were being callous that day is far, far from the truth of the matter. Sincerely, Oliver Avens Dean of Rockefeller College|~|
81651|~|Immigrant parents|~|   March 25 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Matthew Choi Taitano|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Walking through Frist during midterms, I could not help overhearing multiple students on the phone with their parents. Whether it was discussing fears of finishing an essay on time or the pressure of studying for an exam the next day, they saw their parents as an outlet for their stress. This may be of little surprise, given how overwhelming Princeton can be. From schoolwork, clubs and organizations, to jobs and internships, there are a lot of things happening in the lives of Princeton students. To help get through the stress, many students naturally turn to their parents, who have acted as one of the main sources of consolation throughout their lives. Witnessing these conversations was interesting because in times of high stress I have always tended to turn away from my parents, especially my mother. It’s not because I don’t love my mother or have a good relationship with her. Rather, I have difficulty communicating with her due to language and cultural barriers. My mom is a Korean immigrant, who has always had trouble speaking English. I, on the other hand, grew up going to schools focused on English, losing my Korean tongue in the process. At the time, I didn’t think this would lead to any serious repercussions. For day-to-day issues, I knew enough Korean and she knew enough English for us to communicate with each other. However, these language barriers have presented larger problems as our lives have deviated, and my life has become more complicated in college. Every time I try to explain to my mother what’s happening on campus or in my life via a phone or FaceTime call, I find myself getting frustrated because I wouldn’t know the appropriate word in Korean for what I wanted to say. Conversations would usually be cut off with an, “Ugh, never mind,” leaving whatever was wanted or needed to be said unsaid. In the past, when we shared the same people, town and environment, it was easier to transcend these difficulties. However, the American college experience is so different from her own. For example, here at Princeton, as well as other American institutions, students comfortably and openly use psychological services to deal with the school’s intense academic rigor. Yet, my mother doesn’t know this. She grew up in a culture where mental health problems were often dismissed. Mental health problems were seen as a weakness and people suffering from them were expected to just buck up. Because of this stigmatization, if I needed to use these services, she’d be quick to disapprove, adding further stress. Communicating with immigrant parents can be a difficult task for students. However, to help mitigate these issues, students can try to better communicate these kinds of differences to their parents in a more understandable manner. For instance, at Princeton, we have a vast network of people both among our peers and professors and some are likely to have had very similar experiences to our own. We should take advantage of this network, seeing if we can learn from others. Additionally, students should perhaps reconsider how exactly they want their parents to respond. Do they really need their parents’ enthusiastic approval, or is their understanding enough? Taking the time to more deeply consider what we want and need out of our parents might help us to better respond to their reactions. Finally, students should also remember that, sometimes, parents don’t need to know about everything. Students may often feel pressured to update their parents about every little aspect of their lives, making conversations more frustrating than they need to be. However, if we focus only on what will really benefit either our parents or ourselves, we can avoid the unnecessary stress that comes with discussing unimportant topics. Granted, coming to this realization may be difficult for some, especially if a relationship has been built on this kind of detailed sharing. However, if students seriously consider what they need or want to tell their parents, rather than feel a sense of urgency to tell their parents everything, they might start being able to strike an acceptable balance with what they should tell their parents.|~|Matthew Choi Taitano is a freshman from Yigo, Guam.

81619|~|Dining halls: the present and the future|~|   March 25 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In his recent column, “Run Dining Halls like a Business,” fellow opinion columnist Newby Parton argues that University meal plans are a “horrible and scandalous” deal that would “bankrupt a real restaurant in a week.” His strong assessment leads him to a simple conclusion: “Find the waste. Slash it. Give dining hall incentives to cut costs. Let students opt out of the meal plan after the first semester, but offer them a reasonable price so they will want to stay. Bring in restaurateurs to help.” Initially after reading Parton’s article, I agreed wholeheartedly with his argument. The $17.53 a meal figure did indeed appear shockingly high, especially in comparison to a meal at Yale, which averages $11.17. But after examining his methodologies, his assessment seems questionable. Therefore, in this piece I aim to first discuss Parton’s article regarding the present state of the dining halls and then move on to talk about their potential future. Parton bases his entire argument on a figure he calculated using the Block 95 meal plan, which costs $3,330 per year. It is the smallest plan the University offers and is only available to juniors, seniors and graduate students. Parton explains in the comments section of his article that he chose the Block 95 plan “because this is a lot of meals — we would still expect economies of scale to come into play here — and its limits allow for calculating a definite number.” To give a fairer estimate, however, he should have done the math with other plans or taken an average. The Block 95 plan is designed for less frequent users who want flexibility. Parton himself can’t even get onto this plan as a freshman because it is only offered to upperclassmen. Since this is a plan for a targeted group, its individual meal costs do not reflect the actual sum paid by an average student. It is actually the most expensive plan per meal available. It would have been better journalistic practice had Parton included figures from other Block plans and the Unlimited plan, especially given that they can tell another story. Each meal costs $14.63 on the Block 190. The cost goes down to $12.36 on the Block 235. The Unlimited is a whole new question. Parton originally claimed in the comments section that an unlimited plan would come out to be around $12 a meal if we assume that a student eats three meals a day for 24 academic weeks. Since then, he has admitted that he had neglected to include reading and exam periods. Each semester, reading period takes up eight days and exam period ten days. This is 36 extra days, or approximately five extra weeks. Then there are break meal plans for fall, Intersession and spring breaks, when students on the Unlimited can have two meals a day. Each of these breaks is nine days. And then there are ten guest swipes. So if a student on the Unlimited eats three meals a weekday, two on the weekends, he would eat about 615 meals in a year at a cost of only $9.84, which is lower than the average meal cost at Yale’s figure according to Parton. Additionally, I did not include late meal for the sake of simplicity. With late meal, the price is significantly lower. (Aside: Parton’s Yale figure is calculated using guest meals, not student plans. Yale’s Unlimited meal plan, which is comparable to what our plan offers, is $6340 a year, $290 more expensive than our own Unlimited). Parton’s figures, which come from the Block 95, lead to exaggerations throughout the article. He uses the cost of an individual meal on the Block 95 as the cost of late meal. For instance, he writes, “I asked why a $17.53 swipe at Late Meal buys less than $7 of food. She could not comment at that time, either.” The $17.53 does not accurately reflect the cost of a late meal, but rather a meal on the Block 95 plan. The amount he had to pay for food at Hunan is about $9.84. However, at Hunan, he would have needed to pay more had he decided he wanted spring rolls, soup or even a bottle of water. At the dining hall, he can stuff himself from soup to dessert at no additional cost. The point is moot. The two systems are so different that they are not comparable anyway. A dining hall may not need to worry about making profit or rent, but it needs to worry about providing an incredible amount of diversity. It needs kosher, vegetarian, vegan options, skim milk, 2% milk: you get the idea. And it needs large quantities of each. As shown, the average price of a dining hall meal vastly differs depending on the assumptions made in the calculations. Although I disagree with Parton’s assessment, it does not mean the dining hall is flawless. First, I agree wholeheartedly with Parton that students should not be forced to go onto a meal plan at Princeton. While I do not believe that going to Nassau Street for meals would be cheaper, I am against the idea of students being forced to purchase food from the University. The biggest problem I see, though, is the price tag difference between the Unlimited and Block plans. The Unlimited plan offers an incredible amount of meals, but it is almost too comprehensive to fit the eating habits of most students. Very rarely will students eat all three meals a day and two late meals and stay on campus for all of reading period, exam period and the breaks. This is the reason we have the Block plans. However, as it stands, the University strongly encourages students to purchase the Unlimited. The Block 190, for example, is only $490 less expensive than the Unlimited a year, even though it comes with so few benefits compared to the Unlimited. For me, I knew before coming to Princeton that I was not a big eater. The $490 difference was enough to motivate me to go on the Block 190. But given the sad fact that $490 is nothing in the grand spectrum of extravagant spending that is our college education, this difference is not enough to motivate students to go on smaller meal plans. The result is that students are enrolled in the Unlimited even when their eating habits are better fit for a smaller plan. The dining hall has no reason to charge a student more per meal because they are on a smaller meal plan. It needs to prepare the same amount of food anyway and should not be affected by these kinds of economies of scale. Parton was right in pointing out that each meal on the Block 95 is too expensive. If a meal on each of the Block plans also costs $9.84, more students will find a stronger financial incentive to enroll in a plan that is the most appropriate for them. Princeton should also enable the Block plan meal swipes to carry over into the breaks. Because of skipped meals, ramen and too many dollars spent on Nassau Street, I had a lot of meal swipes left by the end of the semester even though I am on the Block 190. I could have easily used them for fall break, when I decided to stay on campus. Instead, I was forced to go on a break meal plan for $180. If I had wanted to stay for Intersession and spring breaks, my meal plan would have cost more than the Unlimited, which does not sound right. Providing the option of purchasing additional meals and the option of allowing students to use their regular meal swipes would further incentivize students to find the meal plan that is most appropriate for them. It would also prevent students from going home when they want to stay on campus because they are worried about money. The dining hall system is not the inefficient, scandalous mess that Parton makes it out to be. But it is also not perfect. The students and the administration can work together toward accomplishing a more efficient dining hall system.|~|Erica Choi is a freshman from Bronxville, N.Y.

81480|~|The missing piece at the ‘Best Darn Place of All’|~|   March 24 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Eileen Torrez ’13 Princeton is an amazing place. The beautiful campus, gifted professors and all-star students make for an incredible four-year experience. Whether it’s Saturday night parties on the Street or Tuesday night cookies at Murray-Dodge, every Princetonian cherishes memories of his or her best times on campus. For me, one of the highlights was singing under the arches with the Wildcats, one of Princeton’s all-female a capella groups. The Wildcats were my on-campus family, my soul sisters and some of my best friends. So it came as quite a blow this January when I heard from a fellow Wildcat alumna that a member of our group, Audrey Dantzlerward ’16, had passed away. We were shocked and devastated. Audrey was one of the most exuberant people I had met at Princeton, with a bright smile and infectious laugh. During rehearsals, I often noticed how her joyful disposition was dampened by the demands of college life. In the few heart-to-hearts we had outside of rehearsals, we connected around our shared struggle as low-income minority students trying to adapt to Princeton’s heavy workload and highly individualistic academic culture. When I heard the news of her passing, my heart sank like a ten-pound weight. Tears spilled from my eyes, for Audrey, for her family, for her friends and for the students who had gone before her. Such a beautiful soul, gone. While the impact on me was partly numbed by time and distance from Princeton, my heart ached deeply for friends who were still on campus, fighting to push through Dean’s Date and final exams while coming to terms with such a devastating loss. In the weeks that followed, I hoped to see a sweeping response from the Princeton community acknowledging the tragedy and its impact on students. But while emails and Facebook messages abounded, the administration’s response to Audrey’s death was rather subdued. Only one statement appeared on Princeton’s webpage, and as a result, very few alumni even knew that a student had died. For students on campus, communication and support were even more minimal than one might expect. A memorial gathering was held the night of Jan. 12, where students and staff gathered to support one another and honor Audrey’s life. According to The Daily Princetonian’s report on the gathering: “Senior Associate Dean of the College Claire Fowler [and all the residential college deans] sent an email to students before the meeting asking them to meet with a residential college administrator if they felt coping with Dantzlerward’s death was interfering with their academic work.” While I’m sure Dean Fowler and the other deans meant well, this statement unfortunately suggests that in the eyes of the administration, academic work comes first, and student health comes second. Of course, Princeton is an academic institution, and keeping up with schoolwork is a high priority. But in the face of something as grave as the loss of a life, academics can and should be superseded by other concerns. What students needed, especially those who were close to Audrey, was acknowledgment and support around the emotional reality of losing a peer. From what I heard from my friends on campus, this support has been limited at best. Counseling and Psychological Services offered a workshop on Distress Awareness and Response on Feb. 9, informing students on how to best care for friends having a hard time. While this marks a step in the right direction, it ultimately serves only as a band-aid over a much broader issue. Our society as a whole undervalues the importance of mental and emotional health: nearly 20 percent of American adults suffer from some form of mental illness, but fewer than half receive treatment. Mental health issues are largely stigmatized and silenced, overwritten by the story that success, money and prestige will lead to happiness. Unfortunately, this story has proven to be largely false. Money can’t buy happiness, and often the most successful people struggle under the weight of super-human responsibilities and expectations. Despite these sobering realities, many of us are still encouraged to put aside our holistic well-being in the name of achieving the ideal of success. This dynamic can play out in a more extreme way at a place like Princeton, where student life is often heavily idealized. Princetonians are supposed to be the best of the best, and we want to prove it! As any late-night conversation with roommates might tell you, many students feel an intense pressure to succeed in every way — academically, professionally and socially. Even if things aren’t going well, there’s an incentive to project the image of being well put-together. In reality, however, it’s not always true. As Princeton’s COMBO III survey found, roughly 50 percent of female students and 37 percent of male students report that they sometimes or often feel depressed. From the comments section of the ‘Prince’ to the Tiger Admirers Facebook page, Princetonians have been voicing their struggles and asking for help. Personally, I can’t count the number of conversations I had with peers who admitted to feeling completely overwhelmed at Princeton, to the point where they were considering leaving or taking a break. Because of the pressure to stay in the game — and in part because of stringent leave of absence rules — most of them decided to push through instead. Unfortunately, these truths are hardly recognized by the administration. Actual mental health resources are limited, and no public, top-down reforms have been announced to address the cultural issues behind students’ distress. The result is a sink-or-swim, “show must go on” mentality that requires students to continually jump through hurdles while struggling to get the basic health support they need. Perhaps the clearest indication of Princeton’s lack of adequate mental health resources is that for the last five years, students have been creating much-needed support networks themselves. Grassroots initiatives like the Mental Health Forum, Mental Health Week and Lotus Café, an informal discussion group for students seeking greater mental and emotional well-being, have shown the deep ingenuity and compassion of Princeton students. They have provided a positive space for students who are struggling — or who have friends who are struggling — to voice their concerns and build solidarity with their peers. But these efforts have their limits. In my two years as a Peer Health Adviser, I did my best to help build a better mental health environment on campus. In the end, though, there was only so much I could do while keeping my own head above water. Through my friendships with students who did amazing work through those initiatives, I saw how despite their genuine passion for the cause, they simply had too much work and not enough energy to create the comprehensive change they wanted to see. Without adequate training or compensation for their work, their efforts became a liability to their own school-life balance. It’s inspiring to see the power of these grassroots initiatives start to shift the culture on campus. But the truth is that even if a handful of committed students are willing to sacrifice more of their own academic careers to bring these projects to completion, it is not their job. There are paid professionals at Princeton charged with the mental and emotional well-being of students. They can take bolder steps toward reform, advocating for more programs and incentives that foster a better mental health environment on campus. The CPS workshop was a great place to start, but for real change to happen, these events and workshops need to happen year-round, and their subject matter must become a more ingrained, long-term and open conversation. In addition, the administration can foster many other projects to help support the health and well-being of Princeton students. What about an AlcoholEdu-style program, focused on mental health issues? What about more counselors, and regular evaluation forms, at CPS? What about a Mental Health Week not just once a year, but every semester? These are a few of many ideas that I’m not the first to propose, but that have yet to be implemented. If we learned anything by losing Audrey, we learned that these initiatives need to start now. No one can get through an institution like Princeton without some support, and many students need more than what’s being currently offered. Princeton leads the vanguard when it comes to cutting-edge research, technology and business ideas. The issue of mental health now presents an opportunity for the administration to show its commitment to being the best of the best in ways that really matter. This means publicly demonstrating a shift in priorities toward fostering a healthier mental and emotional environment on campus. It also includes implementing real changes that empower and encourage students to find complete mental well-being as part of their education and growth at Princeton. What if Princeton graduates were not just the most successful, but also the happiest? Top-notch academic work requires top-notch mental health care. Students are asking for this support and doing the footwork — it’s time for the administration to play a larger role. In doing so, Princeton can help change the collegiate culture surrounding mental health and create new ideas about what success looks and feels like. Most importantly, fostering overall well-being in the University we know and love just might help save the lives of Princeton students in years to come.|~|Eileen Torrez graduated Princeton in 2013.

81475|~|Don’t be a trafficker |~|   March 24 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|Do you remember that film “Good Will Hunting”? Where Matt Damon’s character calls out this guy in a Harvard bar for regurgitating some advanced textbook just to impress a girl? At one point, he’s sitting on a park bench with Robin Williams and Robin says, “you’re just a kid, you don’t have the faintest idea what you’re talking about.” Matt’s supposed to be playing a young genius that has gone unrecognized by the world. As a student on Princeton’s campus — as a part of the Ivy League community — I’m pretty sure I’ve met a couple of geniuses and probably a lot more who could almost qualify. We all talk about this top-class education, where the students are reading all the time. We’re busy taking advantage of all the information that’s out there. After hearing Monica Lewinsky’s TED Talk, I’ve begun to wonder if that’s actually a good thing. Should we be striving to know everything, to pass judgement on everything? On March 19, Monica Lewinsky, the then-22-year old intern that Bill Clinton referred to when he said, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman,” talked about the culture of online public shaming. She drew upon her personal experiences from when she worked at the White House in 1998. For a while, she was the woman we shoved into a corner of scandal and scorn. We made her an object of political caricaturization, a mere cultural reference in bad rap songs and perhaps worst of all, the first young victim of large-scale public humiliation. I was scrolling through the past decade and a half’s worth of Monica Lewinsky references online and each was more distasteful than the last. I wondered, when they were first made, how many of these “jokes” were thought to be witty? Did the jokesters think themselves clever in their ability to show how much they knew about politics and current events and even more so when they could manipulate this knowledge all for a poorly earned chuckle? In so many cases, I’ve found that highly educated people — most often, professed patrons of news magazines and websites — frequently make these jokes and call it well-informed satire. Princeton students are certainly no exception. Who can blame us? From the first day, we’re thrown into a setting of serious academic discussion that leaves little room for settling down and adjusting. The more we’re expected to talk, the less time we have to think about what we’re saying or what our peers are saying. We forget to question why information that is out there is out there, how it got there and whether it should be out there. It seems with the overwhelming availability of information, we become obsessed with getting all of it and then showing it off. We never stop to differentiate between being a societally conscious, intellectual individual and a trafficker of online harassment. The greatest lesson that our professors can teach us is not to analyze information, but to know when to reject it. This might sound absurd — after all, why not take advantage of information that’s been made publicly available? Then again, in that same vein of thought, we’d have to ask, why not open a website link for a leaked celebrity sex tape? Why not open the forwarded email from an eating club that exposes an intimate act between two students? Why not invade someone’s privacy or violate his or her space just because you can? In early March, Wesleyan University’s campus newspaper, The Wesleyan Argus, released a news article, reporting the arrest of four students allegedly involved in the distribution of the drug Molly/MDMA. This article was followed up with a response by the Argus’ Editors-in-Chief, Gabe Rosenberg and Sofi Goode, who stated that the publication would not release the names of the Molly overdose suspects after consulting with their executive editors (EICs of previous semesters) as they “took into consideration that the investigation was still ongoing and no student had been convicted.” In February and September of 2014, the Prince similarly dealt with issues of disclosing students’ names after their arrests for the possession of marijuana, eventually deciding that it was the newspaper’s responsibility to publish them. Whether or not either of these decisions was morally correct, both involved a thorough consideration of the implications in releasing this information to the public. As students, we don’t have the convenience to consult with an entire editorial or public relations team to filter what we say, view or post online. Nonetheless, we should still attempt to consider all the implications of certain pieces of informations. By knowing when to reject information and when to contribute, we practice restraint and demonstrate the full potential of our education. And in the end, sometimes when an opportunity is presented to us, it’s best not to take advantage of it.|~|Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major from Irvine, Calif.

81325|~|Under the protection of the Fire Code she flourishes|~|   March 23 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|When the day comes that the stones of Whitman College combust spontaneously, I will be ready. I will know where my door is because no posters obscure it. I will know how to exit the building because I practice in the University’s regular fire drill rituals. I have a friend who says she could locate doors and exits without the Fire Code — but she’s an atheist. To the rest of us, the Code is sacred. Without it we might do something dangerous, like using a microwave that other New Jersey colleges deem safe, or leaving through an emergency exit immediately, without pausing for 15 seconds to admire the growing flames. Simply put, our faith in the Code saves us, and nonbelievers are going to burn. Atheists like my friend are in the business of demanding “proof” that the Code protects us. They point to contrary “evidence” like Montclair State University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology, which have better fire safety ratings than the University despite their less draconian fire policies. But here is all the proof you need: No University student has ever died in a campus fire. Compare us to the other 139,203 American schools — especially the 98,817 elementary schools, where unauthorized microwaves and door-posters abound — and you’ll realize just how unique our safety record is. Outside Fitz-Randolph gate, schoolchildren are burning like ants. In fact, a student has died in a school fire as recently as 1958. To an institution as venerable as the University, 57 years without a fire death is hardly longer than a week. A deadly fire could strike today, or tomorrow, or maybe it struck yesterday between my writing of this column and its publication. If our Code is relaxed, we will be in the same danger as the rest of the country’s students. It is a risk we cannot afford. Sadly, I am one of the last students to believe fully in the sanctity of the Code. Many of my peers are cafeteria Coders at best, removing duct tape from their doors for fire inspections, and vocal atheists at worst. Then there are the polytheists. They accept what is written in the Code, but they want to practice other drills: an active shooter drill, for example. They would pray to a golden calf because of shootings like the 2007 Virginia Tech Massacre, where senior Seung-Hui Cho shot 32 victims to death. Alas, the polytheists are misguided. They fail to see that the shooting at Virginia Tech, like the 114 shootings in American schools since then, was an isolated incident. We are safe. Our peers are safe, too: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has gone nearly two years without a deadly shooting, and no one has been shot to death on Harvard’s campus since 2009. How rash it would be for the University to adopt a policy preparing us to survive a shooting. Gunmen are simply not a threat. I have called on the administration to make changes in the past, but, because this is a matter concerning the Code, I am begging them to keep everything the same. Updating safety drills for the twenty-first century would ruin us. We must remember what is written in Matthew 5:18: “Until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Fire Code until everything is accomplished.” If we try to alter the Code, or if we begin to worship other codes, we will face the wrath of God. Nonbelievers are going to continue their cries for ostensibly safe microwaves and the right to place their posters willy-nilly, but we must not listen. We must also ignore the particularly radical breed of extremists who would like to modify the Fire Code in the interest of “safety.” Despite what they may claim, those doors that open after 15 seconds are safe. The fire, like a gunman, will politely wait.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn. He can be reached at newby@princeton.edu. 
81327|~|The last column about the commenters (hopefully)|~|   March 23 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|This year, as I entered my second year writing for the ‘Prince,’ I have noticed a lot of articles discussing and criticizing the comments section below our articles. I am talking about articles like Sarah Sakha’s “Just Keep Scrolling,” Newby Parton’s “Thoughts on Freshman Columnists,” and Will Rivitz’s “Snark’s Inefficacy.” The most recent of these was published just this month. All the articles share a similar theme, a criticism of the harshness of the commenters. On the one hand, I can empathize with these writers, particularly because all of them are freshmen. I have received extremely harsh criticism from commenters as well. Some of the criticism was logical and earned; some of it was unfair. However, if we are to be an effective paper I believe we need to move on from dwelling on the commenters, because they are an unavoidable part of any online publication. I understand this column may come across as slightly ironic; after all, I am contributing one more article to the recent deluge of columns discussing the topic of critical commentary in response to other articles. However, I believe it is important to make this criticism in this forum, because the other articles were published here as well. I have written in other online publications before. Whatever the blog or newspaper, whatever the size or demographic of the intended audience, all online publications have one thing in common: at least a few snarky, uncomplicated comments. It is these that are most often complained about. However, to complain about them is to miss the point. They are not intended to strike up complicated debates or even really critique the author’s argument. They are just meant to draw attention or show general displeasure with any aspect of the article. To highlight these by writing multiple articles about them is to put a hundred times more thought into them than the original commentator did. Discussing them can never have a fruitful ending because, again, they were never truly meant for discussion. In fact, reactionary writing in response to the banal, intentionally inflammatory comments gives them attention and makes the authors look defensive. Both of these things only encourage further snarky comments. In “Snark’s Inefficacy,” Will Rivitz mentions that snarky comments are defined by the fact that it is impossible to respond well to them in an intelligent, meaningful, thoughtful manner. As such, I propose that we don’t respond to them — either in the comments or in long articles. Comments are an important part of online debate. Many of them are intended to add on to the articles or to seriously critique them, bringing up things the author overlooked, ignored or misinterpreted. These comments are useful to read and engage with. I don’t generally like to write about my own writing, or about the way writing works in the opinion section of the ‘Prince’. I believe the opinion page is best served if all of the opinion writers focus on larger issues of interest to the campus as a whole. However, because the trend of articles complaining about commenters has continued, I think it is important to take a decisive stance in this venue. I hope that moving forward we choose to use this space in a more productive manner. This year’s freshmen will likely grow completely unaffected by comments soon — exposure makes you tough. But I hope next year’s new writers and those that come after them can skip that intermediary step. I hope they move straight to being as unaffected as possible by rude and unproductive comments. Hopefully, in the upcoming semester, we can all decide to participate in meaningful and productive discussions, even in the comments sections of the ‘Prince’. Failing that, maybe we can at least learn to ignore such comments.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va. She can be reached at zmubarak@princeton.edu. 
81323|~|Paying attention to women’s sports|~|   March 23 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|If you had asked me a month ago if our women’s basketball team was any good, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you. And I even know someone on the team. Admittedly, I don’t really follow sports much. If you had asked me how our men’s team was doing this year, I couldn’t have told you that either. It was only once it became clear that the women’s team was on track to be undefeated in the regular season that I started to pay attention. Granted, part, and perhaps even most, of my unawareness is due to my own indifference to sports; however, it is also clear that part of my unawareness is because we as a society don’t place as much of an emphasis on women’s sports teams. This year, the only other undefeated Division I basketball team, University of Kentucky, is getting a lot more attention. A Google search of “2015 undefeated college basketball teams” brings up nine articles on the first page — eight of which are about Kentucky, only the ninth mentions Princeton in the headline, in addition to a news article about Obama picking Princeton. If media coverage is any indicator of interest, nationally the United States is simply much more interested in men’s teams than they are in the female equivalents. Almost 43 years ago, Congress enacted Title IX, requiring federally funded schools to provide girls and women with equal opportunities to compete in sports. While this law has greatly expanded the resources available to female athletes, equal funds do not necessarily lead to equal support. The fan base and coverage continues to lag woefully behind that of male college teams. For instance, according to the Women’s Sports Foundation, female college athletes receive $183 million less in NCAA scholarships than do male athletes. This trend continues in professional sports as well where women players are paid much less than men are and where many of these female teams struggle mightily for media attention and loyal supporters beyond young girls seeking role models. The view persists that female athletes are not as skilled, as fast or as strong as the men are. We need a paradigm shift that recognizes that female athletes and teams are not inferior; they are just different. Our women’s basketball team is the perfect example of this. In general, women’s teams place more emphasis on teamwork, and less on individual play. But that doesn’t mean that is or should be any less interesting to watch. Those who claim it is less interesting do so simply because we have been taught that a certain style of game play is interesting — not because it inherently is. Val Ackerman, a former president of USA Basketball and the WNBA, released a report in 2013 recommending changes to women’s college basketball to generate more enthusiasm and interest. Her recommendations included joining the women’s Final Four games with the men’s, playing them simultaneously in the same city as is done with professional tennis Grand Slam events. In the alternative, she offered that the women’s Final Four games could be played in Europe or China, where there is more interest in women’s sports. Although these solutions do not address changing our society’s learned male-centric interests, they are a step in the right direction. I would not say that my experience deviates too much from the casual sports fans’ experience. I grew up being dragged to basketball games (both men’s and women’s — Go Mystics!) by my parents and watched some on TV too. So long as my parents pay the pool fee, I have filled out an NCAA men’s bracket every year since I was seven, though I pick largely based on schools I like or have a connection to, or remember as having done well in the previous year (so more or less like most of America, from my understanding). But I have never completed a women’s NCAA tournament bracket or even thought about filling one out, frankly. This year my mom asked me if I wanted to, just for fun, because Princeton was in the tournament. It would have to be just for fun because there was no office pool for the women’s tournament. In perusing the women’s bracket, however, I realized all I was really interested in was seeing if Princeton could beat my home state, Maryland, and how far they would go (or to see perhaps if UConn would win, yet again). I don’t have a huge interest in men’s basketball, but I’ve been taught to care about it enough that I want to fill out an NCAA bracket every year, despite being uninformed. But I never do this for the women’s tournament. Or pay any attention to women’s sports, college or professional. And I’m not the only one. A quick Google search reveals that this year 11.57 million brackets were filled out for the men’s tournament. For the women’s tournament, sites like ESPN do not even give a number, only revealing percentages instead. Of course, at this point on campus, a lot of excitement exists for our team. Over break there were plenty of Facebook posts complaining about the seeding and then reveling in President Obama’s selection of Princeton rolling through the tournament and attendance at the first game. Everyone loves to rally around a winning team, no matter its gender. But perhaps we, the avid and casual sports followers, should have been paying a bit more attention all along, and I certainly include myself in that guilty group.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

81225|~|Thoughts on the value of free time|~|   March 22 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jessica N Li|~|   Contributor     |~|Having lived in Arizona my entire life before coming to Princeton, this past March 8 was my first year experiencing the magic of daylight saving time. Late that Saturday night, like the typical student before midterms, I was poring over notes and textbooks strewn across my table at Frist Campus Center when I glanced up at the digital clock in the top-right corner of my screen: 1:59 a.m. A blink later, the dots and squiggles quietly rearranged themselves: 3:00 a.m. An hour of my life had been whisked away, as though by Hermione’s Time-Turner. I laughed briefly (alone in Frist, like a crazy person), massaged my eyelids and returned to my books. I laughed because to me, daylight saving time seemed like a funny metaphor for the way time works in college. Around three weeks into the year, I finally articulated in my mind why the rhythm of time felt disrupted from the original pattern. It was both a shrinking and a stretching: the individual seconds and minutes and hours slipped by faster, but each day in my “new” life seemed to fit three “old” days. Each day here holds so much walking and conversing and laughing and writing and coding. There is so much doing. But there is so little time to actually be, to feel the seconds and minutes and, dare I say, hours drawn out in all their slow glory, as they move by. I’m a freshman, so I think I can say that I remember my high school experience closely. I was busy. We all were. I was always running from point A to B to C, endlessly and tirelessly. Now I still try to run from A to B to C, but halfway between B and C the fatigue catches up to me. At the end of the day, when I sink into my bed, I feel the tiredness in my bones. It makes sense too. Classes are harder. Work, both academic and extracurricular, requires more thinking. I probably spend a good 45 minutes each day just walking. Sometimes doubt sneaks in. I’m in fewer student groups, and I’m only in class for an average of three hours a day versus eight. My daily list of things-to-do has become shorter, but it’s harder to finish. I worry if, somehow, I’ve become less efficient at managing my time. Yet every time I see an email on Wilson Wire advertising an event or a club that piques my interest, it’s hard not to feel like I’m letting go of an important opportunity. I wonder if this is a position or club that will make my time here more alive and meaningful. Which is why, for a period, I let a manageable level of busy become overwhelmingly busy. I let my workload slip out of my control, let it grow like a cute little monster that never stops demanding sustenance. Suddenly, my day-to-day schedule had compressed the seconds into slivers of time flitting by at an unbearable speed, and my days were achingly long. I think everyone learns this at some point in her Princeton career, some earlier than others, and I finally did too. I try my best to do what’s healthiest for me: check the box, and move it to my folder titled “Later.” The reality — good or bad — is that time works differently here, and I repress the need to fill my time with more doing. I now seek to find empty pockets of time in my days. I’ve come to value time that is completely free and unstructured, when I can set aside “doing” and just focus on being. When I realized that I hadn’t read a book for fun in months, I walked to the public library to find a new book. It was a weekday afternoon after my last class. My shoulders were light after dumping my backpack, and I felt so at ease, taking in the sunshine and the strange almost-spring air. There was a blank space in my schedule, and I was content with leaving it empty rather than filling it with activity. I had carved out a moment for me to be rooted in the present, compartmentalizing the past and the future for another time.|~|Jessica Li is a freshman from Chandler, Ariz.

81227|~|Empower the future through teaching|~|   March 22 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Nikki Bowen “08 This February, my students joined their peers across the country to celebrate Black History Month. My primarily African-American students became fired up as they learned about the incredible contributions their ancestors have made to society, often going home to research the figures on their own and coming back into school the next morning with notes about what they had discovered. As the principal of an all-girls school in Brooklyn, nothing could excite me more than seeing my students so engaged and passionate about what they’re learning. I know the odds they face — just 6 percent of students growing up in low-income communities like them will graduate high school by the time they are 25. But I know that with confidence and drive, they can overcome those odds. I first got involved in education because of my own experiences in school. Growing up, my mother insisted I get up much earlier than I wanted to every morning to attend a school across town. The kids on my block, who all walked to the neighborhood school, would tease me as I waited for the bus. Once I got to class, I was further ostracized. Until fourth grade, I was the only black person in the room. It didn’t take long to realize that I was both poor and different. But my mom knew how important a great education was, and once I got to Princeton, I understood why. Through the Princeton Inmate Outreach Program, I tutored inmates at Albert C. Wagner Prison. I was shocked by what I found — so many of them couldn’t read, write or do basic math. As I learned more about the correlation between illiteracy and incarceration rates, I decided to put my law school plans on hold. As a lawyer, I couldn’t fix the problems that would land my clients in my office in the first place. As a teacher, I could have a hand in changing their trajectories. So I joined Teach For America, determined to give my kids the basic foundational skills that would set them up for future success. Some of my students struggled — one in particular, Challah, struggled immensely with reading. But one rainy, dreary morning, as I sat in the cafeteria and greeted my kids, Challah bounded up to me with a grin. “Good morning!” she cried. Then she pulled out the book she had been reading — above her grade level, no less — and excitedly started telling me all about what she casino online  was learning from the book. Against all odds, Challah had learned to read. In her eyes and mind, there was nothing she couldn’t do. Whenever I feel defeated or frustrated, I think of that morning with Challah. I think of how incredible it is to see the impact of a tough job and realize that we, as educators, are helping shape the future. My girls have and will continue to face challenges in life simply because they are black and female. But we can give them the tools and skills they need to rise above those challenges and create futures for themselves that defy the statistics – the ones that tell them they are unlikely to graduate high school, go to college and break the cycles of poverty into which they were born. We have a long way to go as a country before we truly achieve justice for all. To fix the systemic oppression that has created the gross inequality of the present will take the hard, dedicated work of countless leaders and change-makers — many who have experienced it first-hand, others who bear witness to it from further away. We must work toward these long-term changes as well as the immediate, urgent opportunities to change the way our students view themselves and their futures. As teachers, we can play a central role in this. Everyday, we can remind our kids that their thoughts, ideas, identities and opinions are important. We can share our own stories so that when our kids look to the front of the room, they see a little bit of themselves reflected back. We can remind them that they matter, that they always have and that they always will. Nikki Bowen “08 is an alumna of Teach For America New York City.

81256|~|Editorial: Extend the pass/D/fail deadline|~|   March 22 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|With midterms week, today begins the period during which students can elect to use the pass/D/fail grading option for one class in lieu of receiving a letter grade. According to the University’s 2014-15 Undergraduate Announcement, the P/D/F option is in place in order to “encourage exploration and experimentation in curricular areas in which the student may have had little or no experience.” The P/D/F option allows students to take classes that interest them in areas outside their comfort zone without the added pressure of the usual grading system and its effect on their GPAs. Despite the many merits of the P/D/F option, however, the Editorial Board proposes that University’s existing policy could be improved by extending the P/D/F deadline to the beginning of reading period and allowing students to rescind but lose a P/D/F selection after seeing their final grade in a class. The current P/D/F selection period, beginning the seventh week of the semester and ending during the ninth week of the semester, largely undermines the University’s original intent for the P/D/F option: the encouragement of intellectual curiosity and exploration. When students permanently select the P/D/F option for a class, they no longer have as significant of an incentive to complete the class’s required readings, carefully complete problem sets and diligently study for exams. This is problematic because many of the assignments or discussions that carry the most intellectual weight often times occur at the end of a semester when students have developed a thorough understanding of a class’s subject material. Risk-averse students who select the P/D/F option are placed in a position where it makes sense to focus on graded courses and ignore their P/D/F course. These students rationally choose to forgo full engagement with a class’s most valuable material. A reading period deadline and an option to rescind a P/D/F selection, for many, would change incentives to encourage working diligently in all classes through the entire semester. The current policy also asks students to select the P/D/F option without complete information. The late assignments that tend to be more rigorous also tend to have a significant impact on students’ grades. These assignments have the ability to generate course grades that are much higher or lower than the grade a student receives on a midterm. When the deadline is only after midterm exams are completed, students simply do not have the necessary information needed to make a well-informed decision. In addition, many students in seminars without a traditional midterm exam experience even more difficulty in choosing whether to use a P/D/F since they have little to no way to assess their performance in a class until they receive a grade for a paper or project late in the semester. The Board fears that the early deadline deters students from taking courses with uneven and unpredictable grade distributions. The Board believes placing students in a position to make better informed decisions is the solution to this problem. Finally, the Board believes that students who elect the P/D/F option and proceed to earn a high grade in a class should be have their achievement recognized. In such cases, the Board proposes that students be given the option to have their grade converted to a letter grade but still have one fewer P/D/F selection available for the rest of their time at the University. Extending the P/D/F deadline would encourage students to genuinely explore topic areas unfamiliar to them and allow students to make better informed decisions. The Board encourages the University to adopt these measures to encourage intellectual curiosity and improve the overall academic experience for its students.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of The Daily Princetonian.

81140|~|Letter to the editor: On Princeton Board of Health's proposed tobacco sale prohibitions|~|   March 15 2015|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|The Daily Princetonian article published on Feb. 19 about the Princeton Board of Health’s potential prohibition on tobacco sales to individuals under 21 featured some students’ views on the effectiveness of the proposed ordinance. The Student Health Advisory Board would like to use this opportunity to broaden the context and draw attention to the public health implications of tobacco use and prevention. According to the National Institutes of Health, tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability and death in the United States. Overall mortality of smokers in the United States is approximately three times higher than that among similar people who have never smoked. Cigarette smoking results in over 480,000 deaths each year, and an additional 16 million people suffer with a serious illness caused by smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s also important to remember that tobacco products affect not only smokers, but also nonsmokers. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 3,400 lung cancer deaths and 46,000 heart disease deaths in adult nonsmokers annually in the United States, according to the California Environmental Protection Agency. The American Cancer Society says that over two-thirds of smokers want to quit. Although about half try each year, fewer than 10 percent succeed without help such as medication or behavioral therapy. This contrasts to successful quitting rates of 18 percent among alcoholics and over 40 percent among opiate or cocaine users. A single piece of chewing tobacco used for 30 minutes delivers as much nicotine as three cigarettes, and one cigar can contain as much as an entire cigarette pack. Prevention has become an increasingly emphasized strategy, especially among adolescents and young adults. Over 80 percent of adult smokers begin smoking before 18 years of age, with 99 percent of first use by 26 years of age. According to a report by the Surgeon General, “It is perhaps less appreciated that early addiction is the chief mechanism for renewing the pool of smokers. Most young people who are going to smoke are hooked by the time they are 20 years old.” Many of you may remember initiatives in your middle or high schools. In addition to these explicit educational programs, policy changes are another avenue by which messages can be more implicitly communicated with citizens. Some major cities, including New York, have prohibited smoking in enclosed workplaces. In March 2013, Princeton became the first Mercer County town to ban smoking on properties like municipal buildings and parks, with increasing fines for subsequent violations. Regardless of whether the new ordinance does, in fact, prevent late teens from acquiring or using tobacco products, it provides an unequivocal message that young people should not be using them. It is worth noting that models of raising the smoking age to 21 estimated that the smoking prevalence would drop 67 percent in 14- to 17-year-olds and 55 percent in 18- to 20-year-olds. Ultimately, SHAB is expressing neither skepticism toward nor a political stance on the proposed ordinance. We simply hope to continue the discussion and offer another view — a public health view — of the policy in addition to the student views already introduced in the article. SHAB’s goal is that all students understand the risk associated with smoking and are acting in the best interests of themselves and those around them. Respectfully, Student Health Advisory Board|~|

81050|~|A better Princeton for graduate students, a better Princeton for everyone|~|   March 12 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|We, the Graduate Student Government Executive Committee, have completed our year at the helm of the University’s graduate representative body. After advocating for graduate interests on campus and expending significant effort to make the best of the challenging circumstances surrounding the Lakeside housing complex, we would like to leave some parting thoughts as we pass the baton to our promising successors. Graduate students occupy an uncomfortable space on this campus. In many ways, the University’s college and undergraduate program are its very heart, and always will be. Just the same, the University discharges its mission as both a teaching and research institution far better as a university than it ever could as a college — and the University would not be a university without the Graduate School. Even though the University’s graduate students play roles both indispensable and innumerable in support of teaching and research, we remain largely campus outsiders to the detriment of all Princetonians and to the benefit of none. We believe that the solution to this challenge is straightforward, but not trivial. A significant problem demands a significant remedy, and there aren’t any shortcuts to strengthening the University’s graduate community. Graduate students are outsiders in large part because the graduate student experience at the University has long been defined by the experience of displacement. Unlike undergraduates, graduates cannot expect to spend their years here in campus housing. Nearly all of us, at some point in our graduate careers, are forced to leave campus housing and the close-knit community it fosters. Moreover, even graduate students who are able to stay can find themselves unmoored in a campus community that has little place for a graduate student culture outside of individual departments. This is an experience that hurts the entire campus community and accounts substantially for low graduate alumni participation. It is hard to ask graduate students to contribute when they never felt like they belonged. We believe the correct and overdue course of action is for the university to expand its graduate housing capacity and to reallocate room on the central campus to establish a meeting, study and social space dedicated to graduate students. A call for more graduate housing from members of the GSG should come as no surprise to any informed party. The constancy of this item on the GSG’s agenda over the past decade is telling. Expansion of graduate housing is a demonstrated structural need, not a passing fancy. While the imminent (fingers crossed) completion of Lakeside Graduate Housing is exciting, it nonetheless barely compensates for the closure of the Hibben and Magie, Butler and Stanworth complexes, ultimately  yielding an overall decrease in graduate housing capacity from around 80 percent to around 70 percent of regularly enrolled graduate students. This figure is too low without further qualification, and it doesn’t include students past their fifth year of study, nor does it account for future growth in the graduate student body. Lakeside represents a significant improvement in graduate housing quality, but is merely a stopgap in terms of capacity. More is needed. At present housing levels, practically all University Ph.D. students who elect to live in university housing are forced to vacate their university residence during the course of their graduate program, often during the critical fourth year. Housing in the Princeton area is sparse and expensive, so most of these students must find apartments in surrounding towns and buy a car if they don’t already own one. Each time this happens, a member of the University’s residential community leaves to become a commuter and our graduate community is weakened. Therefore, it is our strong belief that the University should construct additional graduate housing in support of its graduate students and the University community. This housing should be proximal to campus, it should be affordable, and it should structurally support the growth of residential community through provision of central and flexible meeting and activity space. The call for centrally located graduate student space on campus has not historically been marked by the same high profile as has the matter of graduate housing, but dates back at least as far as 2007, when the GSG published a detailed proposal for an on-campus graduate center. The University trails its peers — nearly all of whom provide a centrally located graduate space — in this regard, and the campus community suffers. An appropriate graduate facility would provide configurable space for use by student groups, workspace where graduate students — alone or in groups — can study outside their departments, and an inviting lounge. Such a facility would encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and socialization among graduate students. It would give graduate students a physical touchpoint on, a meaningful connection to, and reason to frequent the central campus. Finally, it would help provide for graduate students who lack convenient or sufficient workspace in their departments. In short, dedicated on-campus space would enrich Princeton’s graduate community in ways we can today only imagine. There are no losers in a future where the University houses a greater proportion of its graduate students, and there are no disadvantages to a University community that brings its graduate students deeper into the fold. Apart from graduate students themselves, every element of the campus community stands to benefit from such enhancements: undergraduates will get better, more engaged preceptors and a wider field from which to draw friends and mentors; faculty will gain a happier, more local, more available and more productive research workforce; and administrators will enjoy greater collaboration with smart, invested volunteers on University committees, task forces, and focus groups. A better University for graduate students is a better University for everyone. Let’s take the first steps towards making this better University a reality.   THE 2014-15 GSG EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE Sean Edington, President Mircea Davidescu, Vice President Julia Wittes, Secretary Rachael Barry, Treasurer Thomas Morrell, Communications Director Mike Hepler, Special Events Officer Çağın Ararat, Academic Affairs Chair Andrew Edwards, Facilities and Transportation Chair Pam Mueller, Health and Life Chair April Williams, Social Chair|~|
81053|~|Editorial: improving room draw|~|   March 12 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|By the time University freshmen reach their spring semester, it is assumed that the rich experiences and individuals they have encountered in the first few months of college will allow them to decide with ease where and with whom they would like to live the following year. And, although the process of choosing housing is no longer a novelty once students reach sophomore spring, finding upperclassman housing can still be daunting. Room draw policies play a major role in students’ lives each spring, and in order to create the most efficient experience possible, the Editorial Board offers three proposals: (1) institute an internal review system of dormitory conditions, (2) release statistics relating to upperclassman housing earlier to coincide with eating club decisions, and (3) arrange University-wide socials for students seeking roommates during the hectic draw process. We first call for the institution of an annual dormitory survey to be filed by rooms’ previous residents to aid in the room selection process. Students would be asked to fill out a mandatory survey in which they review different aspects their rooms. Important conditions and experiences to note might include aspects of the floor plan that future residents might overlook, as well as unexpected disturbances. This survey would allow future residents to choose rooms that best fit their needs. Similar to how grades cannot be accessed until academic course evaluations are completed, access to the room draw form would be restricted until students submit the room survey. Another policy change which could be implemented to the benefit of sophomores and juniors would be the release of the statistics regarding drawing in Spelman Halls at an earlier date. These statistics are currently found on Housing and Real Estate Services’ website. This year, these statistics were released on the same day as the room draw application, Feb. 13. The late statistics release date poses problems because many students base their decision to go independent or join an eating club on the availability of Spelman rooms. In the future, we would like to see the release of these statistics before the January Interclub Council deadline for Bicker and sign-in club selection. Finally, with respect to the process of finding a roommate or hallmate, the Board proposes that more can be done in order to alleviate the stress that is associated with the search. Certain residential colleges currently have their own individual “roommate socials” late in the draw process. Currently, these meetups occur in the form of physical gatherings within residential colleges. However, the Board proposes that this be expanded to an online forum for greater convenience to those students seeking roommates. Such events enable students looking for a fourth member to their quad or a single student looking for another student with whom to share a double to meet others who are in the same predicament. The Board encourages this to be extended to all residential colleges, and for the University to publicize the event. A similar process could be implemented on behalf of upperclassmen in the same situation, organized by an entity such as the USG Student Life Committee. These meetups would occur as close to the start of the application process as possible so as to create the least stressful situation for all those involved. Changing roommates, hallmates or entire residences can be a major nuisance to deal with for the student, residential college adviser or housing representative involved. In order to provide everyone with the most pleasant room draw experience possible, the Board encourages the University to take these three proposals to heart next spring.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of The Daily Princetonian.

81058|~|Reclaiming our humanity|~|   March 12 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|We (or, at least, I) entered Princeton ready to immerse ourselves in the life of the mind. The eager admitted student whose soul is imprinted on the pages of my application knew exactly what he wanted out of college. In chemistry or biology or engineering, I would learn the skills necessary to make my fortune and my mark upon the world. That mark, I was sure, would be academic: adding my share of knowledge to the pool the world uses to improve the human condition. However, I didn’t bargain on spending so much time on the “improving” bit that I’d neglect the “human” side. What nobody managed to explain to me before freshman year was the intensity of it all. For much of the first year, I described academics here as “drinking the nectar of the gods — from a fire hose.” The short semester only increases the pressure coming out of the hose (and the amount which, inevitably, fails to stick with us). Almost by definition, though, University students are excellent at absorbing this sweet, sweet knowledge, so I lapped it up and asked for more. Absorbing that nectar as fast as we can is a priority — so much so that the University all-too-often refuses to accommodate mental illness by reducing courseload, fearing, I suppose, that such a decreased schedule detracts from the true (high-octane) Princeton experience. This rapid, perpetual work spills over into the social scene. “Work hard, play hard” becomes a mantra. It’s no coincidence that the two supplements marketed so heavily by students over the last year, Luminate and Thrive+, are devoted to optimizing the respective halves of that mantra — the former for helping students concentrate, and the latter for helping mitigate the effects of hangovers. I never much enjoyed nights on the street, perhaps feeling too much nihilism in the urge to have fun like there’s no tomorrow. I feel the same pressure in other frivolous pursuits. With the University Band, whether dancing under Blair Arch or scrambling around the football field, I can’t stop asking myself “Am I having fun yet?” If I’m not working, I should be having as much fun as humanly possible, right? In the noise of precepts, pregames, problem sets and parties, something quieter is lost. Early freshman year, I found a spiritual home in the small evening gatherings of the Princeton Presbyterians. Weekly meetings gave us a time to be still, to digest Princeton and to remember what we were here for. However, as I joined more organization, wrote more, studied more and played more, I lost that time. I don’t put much stock in claims of the moral depravity of our generation. However, I was struck by a post in The New York Times last week warning of the danger of teaching our children of the  dichotomous nature of facts and opinions, as if there are no moral facts. The author failed to draw as much of a line between moral and scientific truths as I would; it’s far easier to stand up in a lecture hall and say “We know E = mc2” than to declare “Using this knowledge for nuclear destruction is inherently wrong.” Moral “facts” may not be irrefutable. However, the importance of learning moral reasoning is inescapable. Albert Einstein is remembered well for that famous equation, but his most valuable contribution to humanity is his work in shaping how that knowledge was used and the rest of his tireless work for peace. In the rush, we cannot forget our humanity, or we risk both mental illness and, worse, failing to address societal ills. We have many refuges from the fire-hose of Princeton. With friends in campus ministries, co-op kitchens or eating club lounges, we can be human and explore our hopes, fears, morality and silly moments together. This is something lectures and even precepts do not — cannot — offer. Yet even in these invaluable pockets of humanity, the dehumanizing drive for quantifiable achievement festers. The paradox of Bicker is that the process we use to build comforting communities with like-minded peers becomes just another measure of success, or worse, failure. I have my doubts about the Hose Bicker campaign: we will make of Bicker what we will. As with Bicker, so with Princeton in general, it is up to each individual student to build his humanity around, and in spite of, the intensely driven life surrounding him. So this spring break, take a break. Catch up with an old friend. Fight for a cause you believe in. Read a book that challenges your most dearly held beliefs. Create something with solely artistic intent. Stroll through Prospect Gardens or the Princeton Cemetery, or through McCosh Courtyard, pondering the words of H. E. Mierow, Class of 1914: “Here we were taught by men and gothic towers democracy and faith and righteousness and love of unseen things that do not die.” That’s what this place is for: not your job, not even your calling, but your life and the things beyond it. You’ve spent enough time on the tangible this week.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a chemistry major from Littleton, Colo. He can be reached at bam2@princeton.edu. 
80929|~|Disparate impact, disparate treatment and multiculturalism|~|   March 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Steve Swanson|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|What exactly does “discrimination” mean? Considering how prominently it features in American history and modern social policy, you might imagine the definition to be fairly well-settled. However, two related but distinct definitions of discrimination have been quietly battling in the legal world for decades, largely unseen by the general public. While this definitional debate may seem technical and legalistic, the stakes are high: when applied outside the narrow field of judicial interpretation, both definitions call for far-reaching but mutually contradictory courses of action. This makes it vital for anyone who considers himself or herself an informed citizen to understand the meanings and consequences between these opposed theories of discrimination. The first definition, known as “disparate treatment” theory, is likely more familiar to most people. In this theory, when a person or policy treats people differently based solely on their membership of a “protected class” (e.g. race, gender and, more recently, sexual orientation), illegal discrimination has occurred. Disparate treatment jurisprudence is what brought about desegregation of public accommodations in the South, as well as the ending of gender-selectivity in our own eating clubs in 1990. The second definition is known as “disparate impact” theory and isn’t quite so clearly defined. Subscribers to this theory hold that illegal discrimination need not have any such overt intent; rather, it occurs whenever a policy, neutral or otherwise, ends up having systematically different effects across protected classes. A key example of the disparate impact theory’s application can be seen in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Freeman (2013) in which the EEOC alleged that the use of criminal background and credit score checks for hiring purposes was illegal because of its “discriminatory effect” on African Americans, Hispanics and males. While this case was shot down, largely because of its cherry-picked and dishonest evidence, it is indicative of the EEOC and other organizations’ belief that racially neutral, rational policies are discriminatory if they cause a disparate impact. While these theories have their minor wins and losses in lower courts, the Supreme Court compromises between them: if a plaintiff proves that a policy leads to a disparate impact, the defendant must demonstrate that the policy is a “necessity” or “manifestly related” to their business. At the highest judicial level, then, they are reconciled — disparate impact raises red flags for disparate treatment but is not discrimination per se. However, popular discourse is never so consistent and clear-cut. Indeed, it seems that many who wouldn’t recognize the phrase “disparate impact” implicitly accept this definition of discrimination. The number of arguments that point out disparate impact without an attempt to demonstrate disparate treatment seems to grow every day: partisans present aggregate statistics broken down on protected class lines about wealth, salary, incarceration rate, life expectancy, etc., but end their arguments there. To the extent that people consider these differences across protected classes to be wrongs in and of themselves, it seems they are implicitly adopting disparate impact theory. The problem with emphasizing disparate impact in this way is that the United States prides itself on being multicultural — a pluralist society with no orthodox culture or value system. Further, cultures tend to divide along protected class lines: for obvious reasons, most cultures today are made up of people from similar ethnic backgrounds. While sometimes cultural differences are fed by disparate treatment, past or present, many cultural differences exist apart from any kind of discrimination: the National Criminal Justice Reference Service’s “Potential Cross-Cultural Pitfalls and Dangers” presents a fascinating overview of differences in communication style, values and worldview by culture. Logically, if cultures are allowed to prescribe their own value systems and modes of behavior, cultural pluralism will lead to systematic differences in the behavior of different groups of people. It is here that the irreconcilability of the two definitions of discrimination is most clearly seen. As long as cultures tend to divide people along protected-class lines, leading to different patterns of behavior, it is impossible to advocate for multiculturalism while demanding an end to both disparate impact and disparate treatment. Any two make the third impossible: if we seek to apply policies neutrally (i.e. without disparate treatment) to a multicultural society, these policies will cause disparate impacts because of differing cultural attributes; if we want neutral policies to have equal impacts across protected classes, we must stamp out cultural differences; and if we desire equal impacts of policies for a multicultural society, we must give different groups disparate treatment. Fitting such neat logic to the messy realities of society is a radical simplification; regardless, the inconsistency of upholding all of these three goals at once is clear. Our own school provides testament to the tension between disparate treatment and impact. Princeton adopts something like the disparate impact theory, albeit for a different reason. Rather than considering differences across protected class lines to be discriminatory, the administration tries to achieve parity between groups because of an avowed commitment to “diversity” and “inclusivity” for ostensibly educational purposes. “Diversity,” to the Trustee Ad Hoc Committee On Diversity, is “a precondition for academic excellence.” This drive to balance University participation along protected class lines has led to unquestionable disparate treatment in admissions, as pointed out by Newby Parton in another of his much-maligned columns, among others. Clearly, the University has found that it cannot achieve equal impacts with uniform policies when dealing with a heterogenous population. The irreconcilability of these three cornerstones of liberal social policy by itself says nothing about what ought to be done. Certainly, those policies which seek to end explicit discrimination benefitting privileged groups — disparate treatments deepening disparate impacts — should continue to be refined and strengthened. However, the endgame is very much in question: if we can’t achieve all three goals, which do we focus on? How do we balance them? It is imperative that this debate happen, both in the public sphere and in the minds of the policy-makers of tomorrow.|~|Steve Swanson is a Computer Science major from Vienna, Va.

80916|~|Trending through difficult places|~|   March 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|If you’ve been active on social media over the past few days, you may have heard word of a brief but concentrated burst of anti-Semitism which appeared on the campus of UCLA recently. A brief rundown: in mid-February, a second-year economics major named Rachel Beyda was up for confirmation for the UCLA Undergraduate Students Association Council Judicial Board. Some of those involved in confirming her nomination debated for over 40 video-recorded minutes whether her involvement in various Jewish groups on campus would constitute a “conflict of interest” when dealing with certain topics the Judicial Board – essentially UCLA’s equivalent of the Supreme Court – would come across. (One council member put it bluntly: “Given that you are a Jewish student and very active in the Jewish community, how do you see yourself being able to maintain an unbiased view?”) The incident and its resulting fallout have slowly been gaining national traction over the past few weeks. Many have slammed the students involved for their anti-Semitic remarks, and the council members involved have issued an apology for “remarks made” at the confirmation hearing. I’m not entirely sure how I feel about this. On one hand, I’ve been privileged to have been raised in a largely Jewish suburb of Boston for most of my life, and I don’t think I can remember a single time when I’ve been the specific target of anti-Jewish sentiments. This mostly stems from the fact that my Jewishness is not the most visible tenet of my identity. Though I wholeheartedly identify as Jewish, I’m very much a “cultural Jew” — my religion is important to me not because of my belief in God but because I’m able to gather with other Jews at brisket-laden holiday meals in celebration of our shared heritage. As such, in terms of societal oppression I’m viewed primarily as white, male and straight instead of primarily Jewish, and the anti-Semitic discrimination I’ve seen (especially in the U.S.) pales in comparison to the staggering amount of discrimination I’m able to avoid due to my race, gender and sexuality. On the other hand, though, some of the statements made in the confirmation hearing strike me as particularly ominous. There’s the obvious, like the aforementioned quote. Then, there are the other highly-unsettling statements recorded at the hearing — things like “For some reason, I’m not 100 percent comfortable. I don’t know why” or “[Beyda is] part of a community that is very invested in… very specific outcomes that judicial boards make decisions on every year.” What’s more, the apology issued by the students involved does little to mollify the situation. It focuses specifically on the “words used during the meeting” as opposed to the actual attempt to block Beyda’s confirmation based on what we can only assume is her Jewish identity, as those students haven’t named any other reason they might have opposed her. This seems akin to, say, Lululemon’s CEO apologizing for the “repercussions of [his] actions” (“actions” here refers to controversial remarks he made on Bloomberg TV regarding complaints of too-sheer leggings) instead of apologizing for the sexism it conveyed. It feels as though the council members, instead of owning up to their words and actions and emphasizing the power of the “learning experience,” issued a vague, somewhat sanctimonious declaration that their “intentions were never to attack, insult or delegitimize the identity of an individual or people.” As Princeton students, we have a responsibility to tackle this kind of bigotry head-on. What happened at UCLA is relevant to life here because it prompts us to think critically about our own latent biases. I very much understand my position of privilege in society, but at the same time I don’t doubt that, sooner or later, I will run into the kind of virulent anti-Semitism I’ve seen and heard accounts of manifesting almost everywhere, even in other students’ experiences at Princeton. Ideally, we can use these events to spark discussions — whether campus-wide or on a smaller scale — about what it means to be Jewish and what we can do to ensure such public displays of anti-Jewish sentiments don’t happen even closer to home. I realize I’m an outspoken advocate for the power of dialogue, but I really believe in its power for “engaging [people] in cross-cultural exchange.” If we’re willing to engage with our peers on a human-to-human level, we can discuss our differences in a way that is constructive and healthy for all involved. This column, then, intends to be less an indictment of what happened at UCLA than a clarion call for continued dialogue to ensure that the pervasive anti-Jewish sentiments expressed there don’t surface here. The student council members’ poor decisions must act as a sort of public learning experience for all of us. Especially in light of the unacceptable video footage that has come out of the University of Oklahoma over the past few days (which I haven’t covered up to this point in part because I feel wholly unqualified to present anything more than a complete condemnation of the events), we need more than ever to grasp the reins others are unwilling to hold. If we want to be able to rid ourselves of bigotry and oppression, we must be willing to take what we’ve been nurtured to think and review it in the harsh light of the negative actions of others. As the young people who will inherit control of our world very soon, the less pervasive and deeply-rooted we can make our bigotry, the better we all will be for it.|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

80912|~|Fresh Off the Boat|~|   March 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Nicholas Wu|~|   Contributor     |~|Watching the premiere of “Fresh Off the Boat” with the Asian American Students Association, I came to a startling conclusion about my own upbringing: I felt as if I wasn’t truly Asian-American. While most of the students in the group laughed along with some of the jokes in the show, based on their own experiences growing up in Chinese or Taiwanese-American families, I found myself unable to relate. Even though I identify as a Chinese American, I realized that many of those experiences were altogether different from my own. Granted, I knew and understood the cultural references, such as the difficulty immigrant parents faced with strong Chinese accents. However, these were things that I had not personally experienced. Both of my parents were born here in the United States. Growing up in the Detroit area, they have always spoken English at home. The experiences of Chinese-American immigrants in the United States vary wildly. Much of this disparity can be attributed to the Chinese Exclusion Act and the subsequent National Origins Quotas that all but choked off Chinese immigration in the first half of the 20th century. As a result of those policies, it is estimated that only about ten percent of the Chinese-American population in the United States consists of third-generation people like me. Most Chinese Americans are first- or second-generation. Admittedly, “Fresh Off the Boat” presents only a slice of the Asian-American experience, depicting a Taiwanese-American family with first-generation parents and second-generation children. Neither South Asian Americans nor other East Asian Americans play roles in the show. As a third-generation Chinese American, I am about as far-removed from the immigrant experience as most white or black Americans, whose families have also lived here for generations. Dealing with the language barrier or the pressures of assimilation are simply not things that factor into my life due to growing up stateside. “Fresh Off the Boat” does nothing to depict that part of the generational immigrant experience. Yet, I came to realize that “Fresh Off the Boat” is still an immensely important show. The scarcity of Asian Americans in American media was something that has always stood out to me. In a room full of people at a recent AASA meeting, we struggled to name more than a few Asian-American actors and actresses from our childhood that were not cast in femme fatale or martial arts roles. As American society has changed, the role of Asian Americans in media has changed as well. For example, before the rise of actors like Bruce Lee, Asian men were frequently cast in emasculated, subservient roles like coolies or sidekicks to heroes, while women played hyper-sexualized roles. This stereotyping of Asian actors and actresses into specific niche roles only furthered the otherization of Asian Americans as “perpetual foreigners.” I don’t necessarily share the same cultural experiences as many other Asian Americans who are from more recent immigrant generations, but I, like many other Asian Americans, can relate to the number of times that we have been told “your English is really good,” and then asked, “how long have you been in America?” or, “where are you really from?” Those kinds of experiences are based less on cultural experiences insomuch as they are a reflection of ingrained racial attitudes about Asian Americans. And that is why a show like “Fresh Off the Boat” is so important in the discourse of American media. It does not represent all of the different possible immigrant experiences, but that is not a bad thing — if a show were to do that, the Adult Swim skit “Too Many Cooks” would be an apt comparison. Some parts of it are certainly problematic — the forced accents and the casting of a Korean-American man to play a Taiwanese-American man, for instance. Yet, the very fact that it stars an Asian-American family and increases the footprints of Asian Americans in a prime time TV slot on a major network is groundbreaking. Striking a balance between embracing its cultural roots while still appealing to a larger American audience, “Fresh Off the Boat” could potentially create a new role for Asian Americans in the discourse of the overall American experience. By showing the experiences of the Huang family, the show can help dismantle the notion of Asian Americans as “perpetual foreigners” and shatter the stereotypes for Asian-American actors, allowing them to play “normal” roles. “Fresh Off the Boat” is not a perfect piece of television. But it doesn’t need to be. It is a step in the right direction toward more equitable representation in media, and that’s enough. Asian Americans are currently the fastest-growing census demographic, growing from a population of 11.9 million in 2000 to 17.3 million in 2010, constituting a 46 percent increase — a larger increase than any other demographic group. Asian Americans are increasingly becoming a growing voice for change. Almost eight million people watched the premiere, and it heralds better things to come.|~|Nicholas Wu is a freshman from Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich. He can be reached at nmwu@princeton.edu.

80817|~|Very special victims|~|   March 8 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The Special Victims Unit of a police department investigates cases involving domestic violence, rape, elder abuse, child abuse, victims of human trafficking and victims with developmental or mental disabilities. These victims are labeled “special” for a certain reason: they are unusually vulnerable. These crimes are exacerbated by an imbalance of power and authority, due to age or physical or mental capability. Recently, there has been a debate emerging to empower one specific set of these special victims: female college students. Students for Concealed Carry (SCC), a national organization advocating that state-issued concealed handgun licenses be allowed on college campuses, is at the forefront of this movement. Running events like the “Empty Holster Protest” and social media campaigns, SCC is trying to sell the idea that arming women on college campuses will prevent sexual assault. (That’s not to say that men do not suffer sexual assault as well; however, the SCC focuses solely on female victims.) This idea could not be more disempowering. The concept that prevention of sexual assault is the victim’s responsibility is a new type of trauma. Our lazy excuses have begged the question, “Why were you wearing such a short skirt?” These concealed carry advocates will now be asking, “Honey, why weren’t you carrying a gun?” This re-victimization of survivors of sexual assault is creating what I call the concept of “Very Special Victims.” In treating women like rare objects that need a glass case, these advocates are not only enhancing the narrative of victim blaming, but ensuring that the dialogue about this issue roots itself in the same toxicity of violence that enables sexual assault in the first place. Further, where is the logic of legality? These advocates argue that women, as potential victims, should rationalize vigilante justice, pulling a firearm on men who might rape them. The claim that more guns leads to less violence has been disproven time and again. There have been 69 mass shootings in the last three decades, many in states with concealed carry laws. A recent study from Stanford University confirmed that right-to-carry gun laws are linked to an increase in violent crime. Looking beyond the inefficiency of guns to reduce violence, let’s consider how concealed carry laws would affect campus culture. Would we, as Princetonians, feel safer knowing if a neighbor potentially hid a gun in her backpack? Perhaps it would set off the alarm at the Firestone library detector, or peek out of a pocket while she fumbles to collect her books. It’s like putting a Band-Aid on a heart attack — a superficial solution that does not address the depth or complexity of the problem. A campus of such extraordinary distrust not only fails the women who are seen as potential victims, but also the men who are seen as potential attackers. Are we so removed from our humanity that we shy away from combating the root cause of the problem through dialogue and nonviolent activism? Must we hide behind fingers on a thick trigger to “solve” this issue? Additionally, the sexy image of a holster-boasting young woman is rooted in an even more sexist subconscious. Take Bond girls as an example — they never were able to truly protect themselves without the help of a certain sturdy, heroic James. A tagline for “Charlie’s Angels” reads: “Action doesn’t get hotter than this.” These advocates are shamelessly hijacking the debate around sexual assault with a message of razor-thin empowerment. They are manipulating the stories of survivors by turning them into victims of a different sort – one that takes their experiences and further objectifies them. They’re pushing the glass ceiling just a little bit higher.  They are preying on the deepest fears and wildest vulnerabilities to sell a product with a very special message: Sweetheart, it’s your fault if you didn’t arm yourself.  This message makes these advocates no better than the attackers themselves. We are women; we are not museum exhibits that need armed guarding. Women should not have to holster the burden of threatening lethal force in order to feel safe. The root of the problem of sexual assault is with the attacker, never the survivor.|~|
80781|~|Editorial: Creating support structures for students |~|   March 8 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|In three weeks, the University will extend admissions offers to the newest batch of Princetonians, and if the trend displayed in recent years holds true, the pool of accepted students will be the most diverse in the University’s history. All prospective students will have demonstrated strong academic capacity and diversity of experiences to the admissions committee — hence their admission to the University — but not all are necessarily prepared for some aspects of Princeton’s unique academic environment. Accordingly, the University hosts multiple programs meant to support first-generation students, students from high schools with fewer resources and students who will face particularly rigorous coursework during their first year. One such program is the Freshman Scholars Institute (FSI). FSI is a seven-week summer program that brings about 80 incoming freshmen to campus the summer before they are set to begin their academic careers at Princeton. Students invited to participate in the program are typically the first in their families to attend college, graduated from high schools that offered relatively limited advanced coursework and will likely face challenging circumstances during their first semester at Princeton, such as balancing an engineering course load and varsity athletics. The Editorial Board recognizes that FSI is an effective program to meet the needs of particular demographics of students and supports the Priorities Commission’s recommendation to further support the program by adding an additional administrator. The Board further recommends that certain aspects of FSI should be developed in order to foster effective inclusion. Consequently, the Board calls on the Office of the Dean of the College to expand FSI and to create an application process for students not specifically invited to attend the program. Additionally, the Board calls for the establishment of a mentorship program for all FSI-eligible students to help them more smoothly transition from their home communities to Princeton. First, the Editorial Board recommends that the University expand the size of the FSI program and modify the total enrollment cap of 80 students. The Board understands the value of a small community but feels that the benefits afforded to new students would be greater than the costs felt by those who would have been selected with the cap in place. Moreover, community-building activities can still be arranged by residential college advisers and residential graduate students for smaller communities within FSI. Additionally, the Board recommends that all matriculating students be presented with information about and the opportunity to apply to FSI. Some students who do not specifically fit the FSI selection criteria may nonetheless benefit from participation in the program. There should be a means by which these students can demonstrate their belief that FSI will better prepare them for Princeton. Second, the Board proposes a voluntary mentorship program for students who were invited to FSI or who applied for FSI. While FSI does an excellent job of preparing students for the rigor of a Princeton introductory course, students enrolled in four courses for the first time during their fall semester would benefit from the additional support structures offered by the program. FSI candidates face unique challenges when they arrive at Princeton that the typical support structures in place for freshmen are not always equipped to address. One of the best ways for a new freshman to understand how to confront and overcome the challenges of Princeton is to pair him or her with a successful Princeton student who participated in FSI before his or her freshman year and who has since thrived. A formal program can be especially meaningful for students who have trouble meeting peers with similar experiences and face challenges finding upperclassmen mentors through traditional means, such as shared high school affiliation or extracurricular involvement. If Princeton intends to sufficiently meet the needs of every student to whom it offers admission, the University must do more to help acclimate accepted students who would thrive with additional preparation. By expanding FSI and forming a mentorship program, the University can maximize opportunities to support young scholars from every background.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of The Daily Princetonian.

80779|~|Dealing with an existential crisis|~|   March 8 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I’ve been facing an existential crisis. But this is no ordinary crisis about the purpose or value or meaning of life (Susan Wolf already covered that). I have been grappling with the purpose or value — or perhaps lack thereof — of newspaper column writing. This pseudo-crisis was spurred by a tangential discussion that I had in my journalism class when the question of the use of opinion in journalism was posed. I held my breath. Even as the discussion continued vigorously, I could not bring myself to mutter anything. How could people question the place that opinions held in journalistic writing, a place that it has long occupied? Does what I write have any bearing? Newspapers have been publishing editorial pages for centuries. The modern op-ed page, which features opinions from people not working for the paper, appeared in 1970 in The New York Times under John Oakes, the editorial page editor at the time. This one page would revolutionize journalism, opening both print and online journalism to a broader array of perspectives and backgrounds. Op-eds seem to be flourishing to this day. Last year, The New York Times innovation report, a 96-page internal document, was leaked. Led by Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, the publisher’s son and presumably heir to the organization, it examines the changes needed in the newsroom in order to maintain high readership levels. If anything, though, the report implies the continued, if not rising, popularity of the opinion section. In an effort to expand user-generated content, the Times is looking to “expand products around opinion” and expand the base of people from which they attract op-eds from, as analyzed by the Nieman Journalism Lab. However, according to the Pew Research Center, print newspapers are leaving less space for opinion, cutting opinion pieces from publication and personnel. From 2006 to 2013, membership in the Association of Opinion Journalists, the organization that represents editorial writers and columnists, dropped by over 50 percent. Based on this trend, newspaper columns, despite their popularity, are disappearing. Many attribute the demise of opinion to financial reasons, but the role of objectivity in journalism seems to play a role as well. When people seek hard news stories, they seek straight facts, not the opinions of random people who deem themselves qualified enough to opine in the first place. After all, we come from a media age with a deep-rooted tradition of hard-cut reporting. Nonetheless, younger generations do not particularly find appeal in traditional news, as affirmed by Pew surveys according to the Poynter Institute for journalism. Furthermore, complete objectivity is near impossible to achieve in writing. As pointed out by the Pew Research Center, “The method is objective, not the journalist.” And with the goals of democratizing discourse among regular people from diverse backgrounds and influencing public opinion, we cannot forget about the role that subjectivity plays in journalism. There has been a greater recognition of subjectivity in journalism ever since the turn of the 20th century, according to the American Press Institute, when the concept of “realism,” or the sole reporting of facts, as opposed to objectivity, came into focus. As the journalist, editor and journalism professor Victor S. Navasky points out in his book, we need more than just events that are objectively reported; we need “critical opinion.” The goal of a publication should be to “to explain the underlying meaning of the news … unrestrained by the demands of objectivity.” What journalism needs is not objectivity, but rather accuracy and honesty. We need the facts, but we also need analysis. And we need opinion — the opinions of not exclusively the columnists hired by the paper in question. Journalism may also be facing an existential crisis in this respect, but opinion will always have a place in journalism, more particularly in newspapers. Returning to the questions I posed earlier, I cannot say whether what I write here even matters because frankly, it doesn’t. But we’ve entered a new era in which plurality is valued over straight objectivity, and hopefully from a plurality in perspective and opinion can we foster more multilateral, diverse discussion.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

80660|~|Editorial: improve midterms week|~|   March 5 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Monday begins the notoriously stressful week of midterms. Whereas for final exams the University provides a reading period and a designated exam period, midterms week is hardly set apart from any other week of the semester, and the exams taken often carry significant weight in course grading. Midterms are often treated like other assignments that students should be expected to juggle; in some cases, students have had 150-minute exams on weeknights, in addition to class and precept. Meanwhile, since there is no special reading period or exam week, extracurricular activities still go on; athletes will have regular practice, clubs and student organizations may hold important meetings, campus events will happen, and libraries will operate at normal hours. In keeping with the sensible restrictions and recommendations surrounding acceptable workloads during finals week, the Editorial Board recommends that University academic departments adopt a consistent and fair set of norms. Such a system would include making weekly assignments either optional or ungraded during midterms week. This would resolve the frustration of picking between studying for exams and regular coursework that often has no specific bearing on the exam itself. For example, a student in the current system might have to submit a weekly problem set on a topic not covered on the midterm. Other classes require weekly blog posts during midterms week, and while these posts may have their merits, they are an unnecessary burden during midterms. Such additional assignments force students to make decisions about how to divide their time within a single class, adding to the stress of finding strategies to divide time between other classes, activities and sleep. This plan would encourage professors and preceptors to assign homework that is directly relevant to students, who shouldn’t feel the pressure to complete an assignment during midterms week that would only detract from their time spent in preparation for the exam itself. While not requiring additional work from teaching staff or professors, this would ensure adequate preparation, sleep and, ultimately, student well-being. Another academic practice that is not implemented consistently across University departments, thus adding unnecessary stress and confusion to students’ lives, is the practice of making previous years’ exams and solutions available on Blackboard. Making such a practice the norm, at least in introductory courses, would give students an idea of what to expect on their exams, avoiding the frustration of spending hours studying material that would end up not being remotely helpful. In the case of humanities courses, a helpful technique that some HUM sections have adopted is giving students access to sample ‘A’ papers. Access to such information on a consistent basis across classes, including freshman writing seminars, would require small up-front time investments from teaching staff in return for smoother and more positive midterm experiences for hundreds of students. For incoming freshmen, coming from varied academic backgrounds, such resources are inestimably helpful and reassuring. Lastly, a formal system for rearranging midterms should be put in place, to allow students with more than two exams on one day to reschedule. Because the nature of our class schedule (with classes usually being held Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday) makes multiple midterms on one day quite likely, the possibility of three exams on one day is both real and unreasonable. Academic departments and professors who already follow such practices do a great service to their students. By codifying such practices and establishing a set of norms and recommendations, the University can maximize student benefit from midterms week while minimizing inconsistency and frustration.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of The Daily Princetonian.

80654|~|Run dining halls like a business|~|   March 5 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|The night of Sunday, Feb. 15 was cold. The wind was biting. It was the kind of night my Tennessee mother fears I won’t survive. In short, Feb. 15 was a terrible night for leaving a cozy quad. But my roommates and I strapped on our trapper hats and marched off campus humming a battle anthem, forging past the dead souls of Princeton Cemetery until we reached our promised land: Hunan Chinese Restaurant. Nothing about Hunan is particularly special. Like every Chinese restaurant, its walls sport vaguely oriental decorations. Its food is Americanized, and Yelp reviewers have given it three stars out of five. If Hunan is extraordinary, it is because it manages to be the single most ordinary Chinese restaurant in New Jersey. Fact: When you subsist on dining hall food, an ordinary restaurant meal is delicious. “I’m a changed man,” said Lawrence Cajuste ’18 upon cleaning his plate of mu shu vegetables. Full and content, he read a faintly inspirational one-liner from his fortune cookie and produced a single $10 bill to pay his share of the tab. Ten dollars covered the cost of his food, table service, a 25 percent tip, and it still left profit for the restaurant. But imagine, for a moment, a restaurant with no profits. You serve yourself and you leave no tip. The food, by most accounts, is blander than Hunan’s, and you must buy at least 95 meals at a time. Each costs $17.53 on average. That’s the deal served at the University’s dining halls, and everyone is buying. This deal is horrible. It is scandalous. It would bankrupt a real restaurant in a week. Yet all students, at some point or another, have queued at a card-swiper, apparently eager to pay. We have no choice. The University forces freshmen and sophomores onto meal plans, a practice that a November state legislative bill hopes to ban. Expect no change soon: the University used its political muscle to earn the bill’s only exemption. Campus Dining is set to stay a bloated, money-sapping monopoly. The richest in our ranks may fail to notice the $6,000 dent, and recipients of financial aid may not care. But consider this: If dining halls were run efficiently, Campus Dining could write students a $2,000 rebate for every year on a meal plan. Think cash for your startup, a post-graduation nest egg, or money to buy 10,000 real eggs and cook New Jersey’s largest omelet. We could do so much! Alas, this omelet money does not appear to be in our future. Other universities boast hulking food costs, too: Rutgers University’s block 110 plan, for example, works out to $17.13 a swipe. Some schools offer better deals — breakfast, lunch and supper from a Yale dining hall average $11.17 a meal — but I have not known a single college whose cafeterias can match the forces of capitalism. An all-you-can-eat breakfast bar in my hometown costs just $6.95, with food superior to the University’s. We too could drive our costs that low. Accommodating all diets works against us, but the sheer number of patrons here will drive down overhead. Our workers earn more than minimum wage, but there is no owner to take a profit. I called Executive Director of Campus Dining Smitha Haneef to learn how dining halls spend the $17.53 entry fee. “Our goal is to provide flexibility,” she told me. “The block 95 plan is geared to less frequent users.” It was a non-answer to a question I didn’t ask. “Why $18?,” I repeated. “Where does that money go?” “I cannot comment at this time,” she said. I asked why a $17.53 swipe at Late Meal buys less than $7 of food. She could not comment at that time, either. Here is my prescription: Find the waste. Slash it. Give dining halls incentives to cut costs. Let students opt out of the meal plan after the first semester, but offer them a reasonable price so they will want to stay. Bring in restaurateurs to help. Haneef explained, after some nudging, that fees pay for “labor, food and miscellaneous expenses” — another non-answer. Other than this, she never said what happens to our money.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn. He can be reached at newby@princeton.edu. 
80663|~|The sell-outs and the self-righteous|~|   March 5 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|At this point in my Princeton career, I can name a significant number of friends and acquaintances who plan on using their college degree to glorify the prestigious vocation of consulting after they graduate. Many Princeton seniors can. In fact, many Princeton juniors, sophomores and even freshmen can, although the numbers increase as each class approaches graduation. Toward the end of fall semester last year, I was sitting around with three girlfriends discussing a future beyond Princeton, as overworked juniors who don’t want to complete their independent work are apt to do. We were merrily disparaging the peers who would end up following a career path in finance or consulting, as idealistic college students with impractical majors are also apt to do. The insult of the hour was “selling out,” a term applied in tones of scathing criticism to the future employees of Bain, IBM and Goldman Sachs. We were the noble, artistic, aimless builders of tomorrow’s society, destined for careers in public service, environmental think tanks and academic fellowships. We were prepared to sacrifice job security and high salaries for our passions. In comparison, our peers who were following the typical fast track to consulting and finance appeared unworthy and conformist. They were lost little souls who had sacrificed dreams for money. At a peak in this conversation, one of the participants — she had kept quiet for most of the self-righteous Bain-bashing — submitted for consideration the idea that it takes an incredible amount of privilege to label a secure, respectable, intellectually challenging career as “selling out.” We paused. We considered. The conversation continued on a different tack, but I’ve been stuck in that pause ever since. What kind of young person dismisses an employment opportunity that promises financial stability, connections and career advancement? Who spurns a job sector that their university’s Career Services staff has the most experience navigating, or shrugs at the advantages of a large, influential alumni network? It takes unbelievable strength of character or a very secure socio-economic background to become a professional artist or a social justice activist. Most of my friends fall into the latter category. Of course, the two characteristics aren’t mutually exclusive. But most of the counterculture Princeton students who abhor their classmates’ career of choice have a tendency to focus scornfully on the future financial security of their consulting-bound peers while ignoring the influence that this same characteristic played — and still plays — in their own lives. I recently met a senior at Princeton who is as passionate about the consulting work he will do next year as any of my friends who want to become professional actors. He made managerial consulting sound interesting, a feat that my freshman year self would have dismissed out of hand as impossible. Once again, I was forced to revisit my assumptions about those who become consultants after college. I had originally believed that their standard of success was based on money, prestige and little else. Listening to this classmate review case studies with the enthusiasm of a child (a very bright, opinionated child), I felt the same admiration I feel when a pre-med student discusses a new scientific breakthrough in cancer research. It’s hard for me to relate, and I certainly don’t want to become a doctor, but I would never accuse said pre-med of somehow reneging on her dreams. Do some Princeton students choose consulting because it’s easy? Probably. The negative connotations of the Princeton consulting stereotype have to do with materialism and conformity, and most stereotypes have an edge of truth. Do I have the right to condemn future consultants on the basis of my own vague aspirations to become a writer-activist-world-improver? Not really. That cheesy old platitude of ‘follow your dreams’ does not specify which dreams we’re supposed to follow for a reason. I am choosing a path somewhat less sure and certainly less lucrative than a job in consulting, but my background ensures that my chances of experiencing real poverty are slim to none. My personal ability to chase down dreams is a freedom that my parents bought and cultivated for me. Any blanket condemnation of consulting and finance jobs would indicate a woeful lack of self-awareness. So, to all of the kindred spirits who roll their eyes when yet another classmate announces that they just signed a contract with McKinsey, I advise you to revisit a piece of popular wisdom immortalized in an old Princeton Tory article written by my friend Tal Fortgang ’17: Check your privilege.|~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio.

At a hearing regarding the use of telemedicine to prescribe abortions, Barbieri made the misstep of using sarcasm to make a point: when the doctor being questioned testified that colonoscopies are now performed remotely using a swallowed camera, Barbieri asked if this could be done to examine pregnancies, as well. Due to obvious features of anatomy, the answer to this question was an unequivocal no, speaking to the representative’s point that the two examinations are different. The audio recording of the hearing clearly captures Barbieri’s heavily sarcastic tone throughout asking the question — though a transcript of the event would seem to bespeak a shocking gap in the representative’s knowledge, a few minutes of research clearly demonstrates that the question was intentionally and rhetorically absurd. However, the media response to Barbieri’s question was as gleeful as it was shallow. “Anti-Abortion Lawmaker Clearly Doesn’t Understand Female Anatomy,” declared the Huffington Post headline, while MSNBC announced “GOP lawmaker flunks Anatomy 101” and Slate painted Barbieri as “painfully ignorant.” Understanding the context in which Barbieri was speaking, it is obvious that he is not some bumbling incompetent, but it would seem that, because his opponents were so primed to hear a Republican legislator confirm their stereotypes about the out-of-touch, sexist, anti-science right, the context and true meaning ceased to matter. Before anyone starts throwing stones, though, realize that this phenomenon is seen on all ideological sides and even on our own campus. A couple of months ago, Newby Parton wrote a column in The Daily Princetonian entitled “The History of ‘wh’: A Microaggression.” In this piece, he relates a minor anecdote from his brief experience on campus, in which friends ribbed him for his Tennessee accent and then shrugged off his complaints as trivial. The point of the whole column is found in the last two paragraphs: from this experience, he realizes that it’s possible that he has “spent eighteen years not understanding when I have said something offensive” and exhorts others to “send [him] a message if [he] has ever hurt [their] feelings.” Now, this column could not be much more innocuous — in a nutshell, Parton got offended, found that it hurt, saw how little empathy his friends felt and realized that he might have been showing this same callousness to others his whole life. The responses to the column, however, were not so innocuous. The top comment on the ‘Prince’ website directs Parton to “grow a pair, you insufferable, sniveling whinebag”; the National Review’s sardonic take featured the image of a sad geek superimposed on a container of Cool Whip; the College Fix accused Parton of “whining and groveling”; and any number of other blogs and sites picked up the column as supposed evidence of the absurdity of the campus left and our generation more generally. These responses are puzzling at best: Parton states unequivocally that the “microaggression” that he experienced was “not very important” and that he is “ashamed” of his complaint to his friend. Considering that the point of his story is just to set up how he realized that he wasn’t being empathetic enough, it’s true that he spends too much space discussing this component of his argument. But it is abundantly clear from even a cursory reading of the column that the insult to Parton’s regional dialect is ancillary to his point and is even acknowledged as trivial. Why the vitriolic response, then? The commentators who picked up the story must have either not finished the column or been so predisposed to seeing what they wanted to see that the last couple of paragraphs didn’t register. In fact, I would venture that the reason for such harsh responses for this piece was, essentially, the word “microaggression”: seeing a buzzword of the left, conservative commentators were so primed to read something that confirmed their stereotypes of the other side as spineless whiners that the nuance and real point of the column were lost on them. The above are two examples of a worrying trend: confirmation bias leads people to see the evidence they want to see in support of the views they already hold while ignoring, forgetting or flatly denying anything that directly challenges them. A dangerous positive feedback loop results: a preconception biases its holder to evidence confirming it, which in turn deepens the preconception and makes it more likely that future evidence will be viewed through its lens. This effect is only compounded by the Internet providing the unprecedented ability to surround oneself with only assenting opinions. Of course, confirmation bias is universal, and it would be an exercise in futility to try to end it with a single column. But as University students, we represent, ostensibly, some intersection of future leaders and the intellectual elite: we can and should hold ourselves to higher standards. The first step to combating this bias is to avoid demonizing our enemies — it is tempting to ascribe the attitudes of those with whom you disagree to willful ignorance or moral infirmity, but the reality is that most people are reasonable and well-intentioned. Newby Parton isn’t a caricature of effete liberalism and Vito Barbieri isn’t one of overbearing, ignorant conservatism. Constantly challenging our own preconceptions and giving our opponents a fair hearing may be exhausting, but there is no other way to ensure that we believe what we believe for the right reasons.|~|Steve Swanson is a computer science major from Vienna, Va.

80531|~|Eating habits in college|~|   March 4 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Matthew Choi Taitano|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Many people see the “freshman 15” as merely a myth made to scare incoming college freshmen. From The Atlantic to The Huffington Post, critics in the past few years have argued that claims of this weight gain are exaggerated. However, every year, there are some who actually do fall victim to the act of gaining 15 (or more) pounds during their first year of college. And while many others do not gain exactly 15 or more pounds, college weight gain in general is still a problem. A 2006 report by the National Center for Biotechnology Information found that college freshmen gained weight at a rate of 5.5 times greater than the rest of the population. With all the stresses and changes that come with starting college, this is of little surprise. Especially at schools like Princeton, where large amounts of food are readily available through buffet-styled dining halls, late meal and study breaks, this problem seems to be more easily exacerbated. At first, the weight gain might begin simply with the newfound sense of liberty suddenly thrust upon freshmen. No longer are their parents around to monitor their eating habits. However, this is not just an individual problem. From study breaks that try to encourage participation by providing food to literal eating clubs built around the premise of upperclassmen eating together, eating food is institutionalized as a large part of social life on campus. What starts as an innocent exploration of independence and a form of socialization with friends is reinforced through the campus environment. These unhealthy eating habits are only made worse during high-pressure times such as midterms and finals, when eating junk food may be seen as a way to cope with stress. In addition to the other negative behavioral patterns developed through these stressful times, such as lack of sleep, students may feel that they have to compromise between health and academia. Freshmen who are enduring the University’s rigor for the first time may have an especially difficult time balancing health and schoolwork under the belief that they must meet the University’s rigorous academic standards. Furthermore, the environment that allows these eating habits to develop is not the only issue. We should also focus on how such habits are treated and how they impact students. Students might simply feel sluggish from excessive eating or develop insecurities about the way their bodies are changing. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix. Simple solutions such as to stop eating so much and to exercise are easier said than done. It is already challenging for students to find a happy medium of eating healthily and exercising, let alone maintaining such a lifestyle. Moreover, a greater concern is not only that these habits are being developed and made commonplace, but also that students might resort to even unhealthier habits. Students dissatisfied with their health might resort to extreme measures to maintain the appearance of health. For instance, they might resort to regurgitating their food in order to prevent themselves from gaining any weight.  Alternatively, students might cut down on their food intake, nearly stopping eating all together. I have encountered or heard of people who have been subjected to such conditions. However, such problems are almost never willingly addressed. Eating disorders still seem to be treated as a taboo discussion topic. I believe that this is due to the stigma surrounding those who suffer from eating disorders. Many people tend to believe that these people are at fault for their condition, rather than their condition being promoted by their environment. Some do not even treat eating disorders as a condition, but rather as a pathetic cry for attention. In a society where physical characteristics other than slenderness are often devalued, it can be easy to convince oneself to not eat or to throw up what one has eaten to conform to the body type everyone else seems to desire. In college, we should not allow our peers to fall into such conditions. When we have suspicions that our peers are suffering from bad eating habits and eating disorders, we should try to help them to the best of our abilities, as opposed to believing that they are products of their own mistakes. Even if we are unequipped to help them, we should at least provide a non-judgmental ear in order to refer them to someone who can help. The University’s academic rigor is stressful to deal with by itself, so having to deal with the added stress of eating habits and disorders is more than students should have to endure. Thus, as students of the same institution, we should assist our peers in battling these habits and disorders, rather than dismissing these issues as something trivial. We should reform our environment into one where such topics can be comfortably discussed. Without the fear of being criticized, students suffering from bad eating habits and eating disorders will be able to talk about their problems and receive the proper help that they need and deserve.|~|Matthew Choi Taitano is a freshman from Yigo, Guam.

80529|~|Our obsession with structure	|~|   March 4 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|This past January I witnessed an odd phenomenon for the first time: that whole month after winter break without any daily class routine, which seemed to be a uniquely Princeton experience. First there was reading period — a time of collective procrastination as unstructured hours slipped through our grasp. Then there were finals, when everyone buckled down and waited for Intersession to come. And finally, strangest of all, there was Intersession. After a couple days of jubilation, many of us who hadn’t made plans beforehand quickly reached boredom. While few would admit to being relieved by the beginning of classes again, there was a part in most of us ready to get back into a routine, no matter how intense. And now that we’re in the middle of midterms crunch, we again pine for that Intersession laziness. But even as we complain about being busy all the time, we usually fill up our own schedules. This is partly because as students, athletes, artists, musicians, actors and dancers we’re willing to give up our free time or sleep to pursue our interests. But I suspect that we’ve also developed a particularly acute need for structure in many different aspects of our studies, activities and life plans. Structure can take on many forms — from the way we pass an afternoon to the goals we set for the future — that can often be limiting. There are clearly certain aspects of the University’s academic approach that lead to an emphasis on structure. The language requirement and writing seminars compel students to learn in regimented, uniformly structured environments. A certain amount of structure is necessary to keep track and take advantage of the many opportunities and responsibilities available to us — it takes a lot of organization to keep up with the demands of courses along with internship applications, interesting events and lectures. Still, I have to wonder whether students may be overly concerned with academic structure. These are not the kinds of things that we consciously think about on a day-to-day basis. We often find ourselves completing only the work that we know will get us through the week, assignments that we’ll put in a mailbox or that will get us through the quiz tomorrow. If there are readings we deem nonessential to our immediate academic survival, we skip them. Part of this, of course, is a necessary prioritization of the short-term over the long-term. But another piece of this behavior, I believe, is our reluctance to commit ourselves intensely to less structured academic activity. To me, the habit of procrastination, more than a matter of short-term vs. long-term, is the consequence of a dependence on structure. Until a deadline forces us into action, we have difficulty motivating ourselves to invest in our studies. For most of us, this survival strategy works perfectly fine. We get through the week, and then the month, and then the semester. But I can’t help but feel that we’re missing something by trapping ourselves in this self-constructed structure of the daily grind, cutting ourselves off from spontaneous inspiration and academic or artistic passion. Visual arts professor P. Adams Sitney explained in a recent interview why the University is the “great enemy of poetry,” adding that “it turns poetry into homework” and that “there’s nothing less sexy than doing your homework.” Structure can be stifling — but worse, unsexy. Beyond our classes, we carry our obsession with structure over to our activities and relationships. In high school I was accustomed to participating in arts groups that didn’t require some kind of well-defined structure, an experience that in retrospect feels entirely different from the extracurricular culture here. At times I get the impression that if a group or club doesn’t have a president, vice president and secretary then it’s not considered a worthy time commitment. It almost seems like people are unaccustomed to simply working and socializing together spontaneously — which could be why so many people seem anxious after Bicker that their friend groups will split up if they’re not all accepted to the same club. But our need for structure goes beyond our day-to-day lives on campus — this need may shape the way we plan for the future. As William Deresiewicz points in his provocative anti-Ivy piece, “the irony is that elite students are told that they can be whatever they want, but most of them end up choosing to be one of a few very similar things” — largely finance and consulting, fields that are practically built into the structure of Princeton through alumni networks. Perhaps we have jumped through too many hoops and juggled too many leadership positions to unlearn these tricks. Maybe admissions should start cutting into Brown’s market. But we can start small, maybe during spring break — those of us who don’t have plans can wean ourselves off boredom and Netflix. Eventually, maybe we can find time to delve intensely into course material we’re excited about or even write long, sexy poems.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I.

80357|~|Institutional Memory|~|   March 3 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Anyone who has held a senior leadership role in a University student group or organization knows, or will quickly learn, that the pace of University institutions is on an entirely different wavelength than that of most leadership terms. In many clubs, leaders take office sometime between winter break and spring break, serving for a year. Assuming that it takes roughly a month to fully acclimate to the swing of things and learn the ropes and institutional mechanisms, and taking away the summer months (since school is out of session, which is not to say that crucial behind the scenes planning doesn’t occur then), that leaves roughly 8 months for actual accomplishment and the effectuation of promised changes, new events and other lasting reforms. The most disappointing thing, which newly elected leaders usually discover about six weeks into their tenure, is the so-called “page and a half” problem. While running for office, candidates often enter an election with a list of ideas they want to accomplish, but upon taking office, they quickly realize that those several pages of hopes have to be reduced to less than half on account of the frustratingly sluggish pace of University bureaucracy. Moreover, in the process of targeting only a few initial goals, one may find that many of the items on the shrunken list will fail, be rejected or be too long-term to implement in just one short year. Finally, when a leader leaves office after what seems like a few rushed weeks, much of which was spent transitioning in or transitioning out, the desired feeling of accomplishment is sometimes hollow at best. Rather than walk out with head held high, too many leaders are left with a nagging feeling of unfulfilled potential. Several examples of this easily come to mind. In trying to create a website, for instance, hiring or finding a web designer could take several weeks. Then designing the site itself might take upwards of a year. Finally, the University has to review the site, both from a technical point of view and an administrative or legal one. By the time the site is up and running, it could easily have been two years. Beyond this, trying to revamp institutional procedures is hindered by the fact that many are complicated and difficult to understand for anyone who hasn’t experienced them firsthand. A leader’s suggestions on improving financial reporting, publicizing events better, organizing annual shows on better dates or any number of other things only seem legitimate if one has planned a similar event before and understands the mechanisms behind why things are the way they are. Much of this is intractable, and coping with it is itself an inherent part of being a good leader. Acknowledging that we will never accomplish all we set out to do is a healthy process of reflection and development. But still, some of this can be prevented, and excess feet-dragging needlessly hollows the potential of our student leaders in the name of the bureaucratic process. I’m not sure whether this means we should start two-year terms or give more active roles to past leaders who seek it, enabling them to continue the projects they started, but some structural change to the pace at which the University bureaucracy operates should be part of the equation. If we continue to have student leaders who think of “a project” as lasting two months and University bureaucrats that see “a project” as lasting six to eight months, such a divergence will only lead to friction and frustration. No one will be able to completely accede to the other side — however, surely some middle ground between these two extremes is possible if we really strive for it. Perhaps the solution lies in electing students at the end of the school year, so they can spend the summer exclusively on planning for the next year, all at once and well ahead of time for the University machine to begin churning. But perhaps it also lies in a streamlined University bureaucracy — unlike what it usually means, here “streamlined” isn’t and doesn’t have to be code for a reduction in services. But when we spend time adding extra offices, departments and bureaucracies into the mix on a project, simply because we feel they should be there, which often means massaging egos or making sure one doesn’t feel “left out” of the process, the bloating of organizations takes place and less gets done.|~|
80355|~|Women’s Leadership at Princeton: Beyond the Numbers|~|   March 3 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|The 2011 Women’s Leadership Report revealed a disturbing reality — in the “highly visible positions” of major student groups on University campus, women held fewer of the top spots since right after the first decade that the University began accepting women. The findings of this report ignited an effort across campus to try to understand why this was the case and how to reverse the trend. The report discovered through numerous interviews that many issues were in play, not only at the University, but also across its peer institutions. Female students were consistently underselling themselves; women were active in organizations but chose less visible, behind the scene roles; other students were actively discouraging women from seeking the highest leadership positions, pressuring them “to run for vice president or social chair instead [of president] on the grounds that these posts were more suitable for women.” Have we finally turned the proverbial corner in 2015 in terms of the newly elected officials of many of our campus’ most high-profile organizations? It might seem as though we have good reason to celebrate the shattering of our campus’ own glass ceiling. After all, the new USG president is a woman — as are the The Daily Princetonian’s editor-in-chief, The American Whig-Cliosophic Society’s president and four of the eleven eating clubs’ presidents. But let’s not break out the champagne quite yet. It’s important to recognize these elections are immensely significant in the sense that women are taking the initiative to run for these positions and are furthermore winning. But it would be a huge mistake to consider the problem solved — because it isn’t. And proclaiming the issue to be over enormously hinders the chances of getting to the root of the problem and truly creating the cultural change needed to equalize leadership on campus and beyond. Don’t get me wrong. I am proud of all the women who stepped forward into leadership roles on campus this year. It is an important and necessary step for achieving gender parity. But let us not forget that Ella Cheng became USG president in a run-off, after Will Gansa ran on a joke platform that garnered the most votes in the general election (though not the required majority). Ella is the first female president of USG since 2003. How is it possible that Princeton went more than a decade without a woman USG president? And while it is progress that we now have more women in leadership positions at the eating clubs, Tiger Inn polled its members just this past November and 70% of the respondents did not believe that any female would stand much of a chance of winning a high officer position in the club. These gender stereotypes run deep among both male and female students. One election cycle won’t wash them away. My guess is the 2011 report and its recommendations — such as the creation of the Women’s Mentorship Program and greater faculty awareness about both the issue and possible causes of this inequality — and the discussions that were sparked helped lead to our present statistics. I know the report’s findings made me personally reconsider why I was or was not interested in taking on certain responsibilities and titles on campus. Ultimately I do not know if I acted differently because of what I read and saw, but it definitely encouraged some serious introspection and discussions. However, it is imperative to recognize that equal numbers do not necessarily illustrate equality, and certainly we have not dispelled all cultural biases just because there are more women leaders in one random year. It is not only mistaken to assume that no obstacles currently exist to female leadership on campus, but it is also dangerous. If we assume we have reached gender parity, people won’t think about gender when electing leaders; it essentially becomes a non-issue. And this is certainly the goal. The most deserving students should be elected to these positions, regardless of their sex. But unless and until the changes have become ingrained in our culture, there is a huge risk of slipping back into greater inequality and losing these gains to both leadership equality and the cultural shifts that have been achieved thus far. On the other hand, when people identify gender parity as an issue, more people frequently reflect on the current situation and how it can be improved. At the panel on women and eating clubs last week, Hap Cooper ’82, president of the TI graduate board, boasted about the great progress TI made this year, from its previous alleged gender problems to having a female president. His tone suggested that the recent election proved that the sexism that had seemed so prevalent just recently — at eating clubs or on campus at large — had completely reversed. The reality is not so simple. Sexism is rooted in our patriarchal society, not just at the University, but also around the world. While a female leader can have a huge impact on changing that culture and the election of a woman can imply that people are more accepting of women in positions of power and the effects their gender might have on their stewardship of the group, it does not guarantee that such a change has been internalized to signify true equality. With this reality in mind, let’s take the University’s recent surge in women’s leadership for what it is: a step in the right direction, but not a reason to stop pushing for cultural change among both women and men on campus as well as for more female leaders on campus.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

80250|~|Fifty Shades of Hypocrisy|~|   March 3 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|Hypocrisy is a curious human condition, and one that is important both to experience and to take note of, whether in oneself or in others. Rarely, however, is it a completely benign phenomenon with few consequences. The results of such conflict between action and rhetoric can be seen in stark relief thanks to the media: recently, through this powerful conduit of information, yet another glaring case of hypocrisy has sprung up that stuck out to me the same way a particularly egregious typo stands out in an email. Harvard announced in early February a revamp to its policies regarding interpersonal relationships. This new policy includes an outright ban on romantic relationships between professors and students in a shift that clarified earlier language deeming such interactions as only “inappropriate.” Some people I’ve spoken with have shrugged at the distinction — claiming it’s not too different from the preexisting policy, but Harvard explained its choice by declaring that “relationships of unequal status did not explicitly reflect the faculty’s expectations of what constituted an appropriate relationship between undergraduate students and faculty members.” By clarifying expectations in this way, some questions of consent can be more clear-cut by removing problematic power dynamics from the mix. I’ve heard few negative reactions in response to this announcement, both in the media and in everyday conversation. Though there are those who argue that this policy is too cut and dry, since it leaves little room for individual cases and for both parties’ autonomy, most concede that it still is, in general, a positive move. I personally do not have a strong opinion either way on the matter of this policy. To me, this is the rhetoric side of the aforementioned instance of hypocrisy — the action, then, is the overwhelming response to the release of the “Fifty Shades of Grey” movie. My personal response to “Fifty Shades of Grey” is nearly entirely negative and, as such, I have many issues with “Fifty Shades of Grey” beyond what I plan to write about here, particularly with regard to the way in which it construes BDSM relationships. This is not a minor problem within the novel and the movie, indicated by the number of articles that have popped up in the wake of its release, describing the manner in which it portrays BDSM as something fundamentally abusive. This, in turn, perpetuates stereotypes about a community that are untrue and serve to further push it to the outskirts. For the sake of this article, however, I prefer to turn my attention to its problematic portrayal of an abusive relationship in general within the context of unequal power dynamics. For those unfamiliar with its premise, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is about the relationship between Christian Grey, a charismatic billionaire, and Anastasia Steele, a recent college graduate who first meets Grey when she is interviewing him for an article. She is unsure of herself and of the world around her in a way that many students can empathize with deeply. Beyond that, Anastasia finds Christian to be intensely intimidating. From there, a cat-and-mouse game ensues that includes, according to the CDC’s standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence, instances of stalking, isolation and intimidation. There are numerous points in the plot that substantiate these claims; perhaps the most alarming is the contract that Christian compels Ana to sign before they move forward in their relationship. This contract stipulates that Christian will provide financially and emotionally for Ana, taking particular care to make sure of her physical health, and Ana will then submit to any desire, fleeting or not, that Christian may have. Ana is rightfully concerned, but still finds the entire thing vaguely romantic in a truly troubling way. There is nothing romantic about Christian dictating her diet (giving her a prescribed list of foods from which to choose), stripping her of her physical autonomy by deciding that she cannot masturbate and dictating what type of birth control to use, instructing her not to confide in her closest friend and punishing her by whipping or spanking should she deviate from the terms of the contract. At one point, he does so when she simply rolls her eyes. Instances like these are not paragons of romance, nor passion, nor BDSM. These are instances of domestic abuse. And yet, this book has sold over 100 million copies and has been translated in over 50 languages. The movie, in its opening weekend, grossed $81.6 million. Why do we, both the media and the consumers of the media, laud or at the very least accept as reasonable changes in a policy to reflect the danger of unequal power dynamics and, in the same breath, fund a franchise that is questionable on all levels? I don’t advocate, as some men and women do, the burning of the book as a show of protest against its message. I am simply calling upon those who read it and watch the movie (and even those who don’t) to reflect upon whether or not they find its messages — implicit and explicit — troubling, and why or why not, especially in the context of what many have come to (accurately) call a “rape culture.” Ignoring “Fifty Shades of Grey” is not a solution to a problem rooted in the mentality of a population. It’s time, however, for some introspection and for that introspection to lead to reform. The question floated above is not an easy one to answer or to change the answer to, but it’s crucial to consider it in the years to come.|~|Kelly Hatfield is a sophomore from Medford, Mass.

80248|~|The beauty of silence|~|   March 2 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Julia Case-Levine|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“What is it about silence that is so unsettling and deeply irksome?” I wonder as I spit out some trite retort to a friend’s comment to avoid having nothing to say. Silence makes me so anxious that I instinctively fill it with some equally meaningless remark. This is a long-standing reflex of mine, the need to honor someone’s reflection with a response. Maybe this impulse is a vestige of my years being coached to participate and assert myself; a remnant from the days I was graded on classroom contribution. As long as I can remember, I have believed silence is akin to having nothing of importance to say. Silence is a sanctuary for those without opinions and original thoughts. Silence is for those who did not finish the reading. But maybe my discomfort with silence is damaging in its own right. I wonder what I have missed out on while worrying about what I have to contribute. I wonder what I would have learned if I allowed myself to reflect on what had been said instead of wondering what was left to add. This is a profoundly challenging concept to comprehend for a student growing up in an environment obsessed with speed, where being fast is equated to being intelligent. But lately I have been engaging in a personal experiment to question the value of silence. I have made an effort to listen in order to understand, not in order to formulate a response. I have relieved myself from the pressure of an immediate reaction and allowed myself to embrace and embody this nation’s most feared state: being slow. As soon as I began allowing room for silence I found I was listening instead of hearing. The questions I asked myself in daily conversation shifted; instead of the perpetual self-reflection — did I sound smart? Did I convey something important? What did I add to the conversation? — I had room to consider what I was being told. Perhaps the most profound revelation I’ve come across is how silence (and the active listening resulting from such behavior) frees us to question our opinions. Without the burden of having to present my thoughts to prove I have them, and allowing myself time to reflect on and consider what I am hearing, I have been able to meaningfully challenge a lot of my biases. There is an important distinction between knowing things and having opinions. We all absorb facts; we are surrounded by information from our parents, friends, teachers and books. Often these facts are presented to us packed in personal bias, and growing up we have become predisposed to accept a particular set of these analyses. We see things through a very distinct lens and many of us will go through our lives without this lens ever being questioned. But taking time for silence, taking time to listen to someone and process a dissimilar perspective before responding, means taking time to question these lenses. I think I posses a great deal of information that does not equate to knowledge. Actual knowledge is how we interpret and analyze the facts we are presented with. However, if we spend too much time caught up in our own ideas, if we are always speaking instead of listening, then we struggle to understand what has been said and we are never forced to confront and challenge our previously cemented positions. Listening is how we gain knowledge, how we test what we think we know and how we ultimately form our own truly individual views. Thus, to be responsible and informed opinion-holders we owe it to ourselves to embrace silence. Ultimately, I found that embracing silence did not mean I became mute; in fact, I found I had a lot more to say.|~|Julia Case-Levine is a freshman from New York, N.Y.

The Task Force is working to identify ways to help Princeton enhance the campus experience of respect and fairness for people of all identities. It’s important to note that the Task Force is an advisory group; it makes recommendations but does not have the authority to “require” actions from the University. The University already has a robust system for anonymous reporting through EthicsPoint, an independent provider of hotline services. This system, which has been in place for years, can be used by any member of the campus community who wishes to anonymously report discrimination, harassment or any ethical violation. I encourage students who feel they have experienced discrimination or harassment to consult a confidential resource, such as Wokie Nwabueze, the University Ombuds Officer, or the Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources and Education (SHARE) office. More information about reporting options can be found on my office’s website. The Task Force, whose work is still in the preliminary stage, has not surveyed students nor collected examples of discrimination or harassment. It is important to learn from students about the campus experience, and I wish to assure all students that any information-gathering will be conducted formally and inclusively. In the meantime, I hope that students will share their thoughts through the “Make Your Voice Heard” online feedback form.

In honor of the month, Shriya Sekhsaria has been writing a very informative series in The ‘Prince’ about the history of African Americans on this campus, from the very first evidence of an African American student, way back in 1792, to the feelings of current students with regards to race relations at Princeton. I learned a lot from reading the series, and I am glad it was written. The ‘Prince’s Black History Month series perfectly encapsulates the purpose of the month: time was taken to honor people who are normally forgotten, because of their race. However, I think we should remember these people year-round, not just in February. I am not arguing against the existence of a Black History Month. Rather, given the current state of racial tensions that were so clearly highlighted in recent months, something like it is needed all the more. In general, historical trends have shown that the majority of people are not predisposed towards honoring the achievements of black people. Something like this month forces them to do so. This ends up highlighting stories that may have otherwise disappeared. For example, I never would have learned about the potential existence of an African American student at the University all the way back in the eighteenth century, had Black History Month not provided a platform for that information to be shared. However, I think that this is a short term solution to a larger problem. The end goal was never to confine the history of Black Americans to the month of February. The existence of Black American history should be celebrated all year round, as part of the larger category of American history. Although Black Americans have had a unique experience in this country, they are still part of the larger American experience. Again, the point is not that Black History Month is not needed today. Rather, it is necessary more than ever – and the fact that it continues to be needed to this day poses the real problem. Instead of relegating the achievements, the lives, the accomplishments and the histories of Black Americans to a single month of the year, perpetuating a tradition that began in 1976, we should really be working towards making the whole concept of a single “black history month” redundant in the future. As a country, we would need to work on this from an elementary school level and work our way up. The stories of people like Martin Luther King, Jr. shouldn’t be told only during February. He should be taught as a great American, simply put. Black History Month mainstays such as George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington should be taught as what they were, scientists and great thinkers, not just answers to trivia questions that only come up once a year.  This is not to say that the race of these men should be ignored and erased, only that it shouldn’t define them. Black History Month is necessary right now. However, I hope it isn’t in the future. Because if we accept this status quo, without even thinking of changing it, we are accepting a world in which Black accomplishments can only be recognized one month out of twelve. We are accepting that the people we honor in February accomplished great things, but only relative to their race. I hope that doesn’t have to be true, and that such artificial separations between different types of American history become unnecessary. I want the Black experience to be honored throughout the year, and not only in one month.  We can start on a small scale, by creating monuments or displaying portraits of important African Americans from throughout the University’s history. At a private institution like the University, it is an unfortunate truth that those who are remembered are normally those who are wealthy or come from wealthy families, because they have the money necessary to build buildings or commission plaques with their names. This necessarily precludes many of the early African Americans associated with the University, such as that potential first student, back in the eighteenth century. We can combat this by deciding to honor them anyhow. Displaying portraits of Black Princetonians would have an important symbolic meaning, showing their role in our history, a role that should be acknowledged during all the months of the year. This would hopefully be one small step towards reimagining our understanding of race and our acceptance of the diverse society that we live in.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va.

80130|~|Snark's inefficacy|~|   March 1 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|As I write this, The Daily Princetonian’s editors are concluding the process of selecting new writers to join the ranks of the Opinion section. I’m incredibly excited about the talent these writers will bring to the newspaper, as the material I’ve read from them is phenomenal. Yet, at the same time, I have a pretty good idea of what will happen over the course of the next couple months. The writers will experience surges of backlash from the wider Princeton community in the form of twelve-word responses from students who choose only to identify themselves by their class year, if not names like “Your arguments suck” and “You just don’t get it”. Those who are freshman will be yelled at by commenters who accuse them of covering issues they don’t understand at all, even in columns to which their freshman-hood has little to no relevance. Those who attempt to foster discussion in the comments section will receive a snide response along the lines of “dude come on don’t comment on your own article”. Soon enough, the freshman columnists will stop caring what the rest of campus has to say about their columns, because the occasional well-argued takedown of the logic behind a piece will inevitably be buried under mountains of snark. I don’t say this to give the impression that ‘Prince’ writers don’t pay attention to negative feedback. As self-applauding as it sounds, we really do care about what we write. At the end of the day, we will put in a considerable amount of preparation bouncing ideas off of friends and editors in an attempt to present a nuanced and well-reasoned opinion that will stand up to criticism. Rather, I paint this picture to illustrate what the near future will look like, one very similar to the situation which Christian Wawrzonek describes in his recent column “On Hating The Daily Princetonian.” Like Wawrzonek, I don’t fully agree with many decisions the paper makes, although I do think that many of the problems concerning the ‘Prince’ stem from systemic issues within news publications as a whole rather than ‘Prince’-specific ones (potentially harmful models like poorly fact-checked iterative journalism are unfortunately the standard at this point). However, like him, I also think that “hurtful, malicious or disrespectful criticisms will only turn away the very people who want to improve our paper and nothing will ever change.” There are many ways to disagree with something a writer has to say, and snark is one of the least constructive ways to do so. New York Observer editor-at-large Ryan Holiday, in his book Trust Me, I’m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator, defines the term as such: “You know you’re dealing with snark when you attempt to respond to a comment and realize that there is nothing you can say.” The comment’s lack of detail or specificity (for example, saying something like “this is one lame-ass article”) means that it exists only as an affirmation, something for anonymous users to upvote. English essayist William Hazlitt wrote, in his 1826 work “On The Pleasure Of Hating,” that this sort of snappy rhetoric (or the 19th-century equivalent) is popular because “we grow tired of every thing but turning others into ridicule, and congratulating ourselves on their defects.” Pointed, substanceless remarks dominate the comments section because it is far easier to write a quick, meaningless takedown than a carefully constructed one. They also do so because it is far easier to skip straight to the comments section and upvote that short comment because it fits in with a particular campus narrative than it is to read an article and come to one’s own conclusions about it. The takeaway here is this: if you truly believe that we as ‘Prince’ writers don’t have a clue about the topics we write about, there are countless constructive ways to let the campus know. If you disagree with a freshman’s perspective on careers in finance, write a guest column in response, as Yesenia Arroyo ‘15 did recently. If you think that the premise of a theater review in the Street section is deeply flawed, don’t perpetuate the “condescen[sion]” in the comments section. The opportunities are practically limitless, and high-quality responses matter. Despite the pervasive attitude on campus, the writers of this newspaper are dedicated to producing quality content if the material we publish isn’t up to snuff. If you think that this attitude isn’t good enough, help change it by putting in more effort than is required for a snarky, ultimately meaningless retort. As ‘Prince’ columnist Bennett McIntosh puts it, “The entire staff of the paper turns over every four years — if you want to improve the Prince, there is literally nothing standing in your way.”|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

80110|~|Somewhere between confidence and insecurity|~|   March 1 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Nobody wants life advice from an 18-year-old. Instead of subjecting my audience to this unnecessary and fruitless endeavor, I will act as a mouthpiece for someone who is much wiser and more experienced than I am. Sarah is my best friend’s mom, who would tag along on our movie dates and make us questionable “green smoothies.” One day, she was giving my friend and me a talk about how we should approach success. It was the season of college applications, of heightened anxiety and inevitable rejections. She was telling me to be confident, of course, but her advice did not stop there. She said that along with being confident, I also needed to be, paradoxically enough, insecure; I should be simultaneously confident in my abilities to succeed and insecure that I have not succeeded yet. I was not supposed to alternate between the two extremes; they had to coexist within me at all times. And each was not to take away from the other. Insecurity is a term which we shy away from because of the negative connotations it carries. It is important to recognize that the way she defined the word implied that there was nothing about ourselves that we had to be insecure over. To the contrary, we should be sure that we are so good that this elusive success could be and, in fact, should be ours. The only reason we should feel insecure is because the success that could be ours isn’t yet. Sarah had given me a lot of advice throughout the course of my high school career, but this particular piece of advice somehow did not resonate until after I started my time at Princeton. Academic success had never been too elusive before, but at this point in my freshman year at Princeton, I can say I have experienced a few humble successes and many, many more failures. Needless to say, this adjustment was difficult and sometimes made me feel unhappy. The first month was a true struggle and during this time period, I reevaluated the way I viewed my competence. On several sleepless nights, I would twitch in my bed worrying about my grades and torturing myself over comments from my professor that I felt revealed my academic shortcomings. Her advice helped me when I was the most insecure about myself. Perhaps it was a cop-out, but the slight shift in blame made me feel not only better about myself but also more motivated. Of course I could do well at Princeton. Didn’t Dean of Admission Janet Rapelye tell us that she doesn’t make mistakes? I was not a mistake. This in turn pushed me to work harder, because if I could do well but wasn’t, the only logical explanation was that I was not working hard enough. The way I approached work was also different, because instead of thinking of it as something that I could not possibly do, I viewed it as something that should come to me. But as everything in life always is, balance is the key. There are situations where her advice would not apply. At times, I’ve started reading a book at 1 a.m. after being thrown from classes to work to club meetings, and then stayed exasperated, upset and stressed until 5 a.m., knowing that I had a 9 a.m. class because I wanted to finish my HUM reading. This made me unhappy in a different way, because not completing a task would’ve indicated laziness on my part, as I was capable of finishing. I couldn’t be satiated, because part of the problem with success is that it’s always elusive. There’s always more that could be accomplished. For my sanity and happiness, I sometimes needed to realize that I was not as successful as I could be or maybe even that I could not be as successful as I wanted even if I tried my best — but that it was okay. Some things are not worth attaining because the opportunity costs are too high. I am certainly less stressed about Princeton now than I used to be, even though my course load increased this semester. This place is challenging, but not impossible. It was always doable — I just had to find my balance somewhere between confidence and insecurity.|~|Erica Choi is a freshman from Bronxville, N.Y.

80108|~|Editorial: Reject divestment|~|   March 1 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Recently, a group of students began a campaign known as the Princeton Sustainable Investment Initiative (PSII), seeking to implement a series of proposals concerning the University’s management of its endowment and environmental impact. Specifically, PSII calls on the University to report on the environmental impact of its investments and ultimately to cease investing in companies that are deemed insufficiently environmentally friendly. Members of the PSII have arranged to meet with the University Resources Committee on March 3. The Board urges the University to reject this effort to politicize the endowment and unduly tie the hands of the Princeton University Investment Company. Caving to such demands would fruitlessly compromise the endowment’s return on investment and, more importantly, doing so would risk the many benefits that a strong endowment affords to Princeton students, especially a strong financial aid program. PSII demands that the University symbolically adopt the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment and sign the Carbon Disclosure Project, calculate and publish the carbon footprint of the endowment’s various investments, and design and implement a plan to divest from environmentally dubious companies and impose this plan on all external investment managers. If implemented in a nominal way, the proposal will simply result in increasing reporting costs for PRINCO without shifting policy, which would simply be a waste. However, if this is to have an actual effect, it will require significant adjustments to the way in which the endowment is invested, permanently limiting the investment choices of PRINCO. That would be unwise. Were Princeton to divest itself of companies that are deemed environmentally unsound, it would have no impact on those companies’ behavior. There is a global market in such equities, so the impact of one institution’s divestment would be minimal. Even if many institutions similar to Princeton were to do so, the impact would be quite limited. Should the price of such companies’ stock dip even slightly below what it would be based solely on their earnings, any investment firm more interested in returns than sustainability scruples will increase their holding in these companies. While PSII proponents might point to the impact of divestment in apartheid South Africa, the example only weakens their case. While there was a global consensus on international divestment from South African companies, noticeable impact of divestment on the relevant companies’ stock prices seems to have been effectively nonexistent. Moreover, non-renewable energy usage is not apartheid. While apartheid was entirely unjustifiable, the harnessing of certain energy sources is not without benefits.  Fossil fuel use has certain costs, but the cheap energy it provides can be crucial for economic development and the livelihood of many people worldwide. It is inappropriate to politicize the endowment; indeed, once the endowment becomes politicized, it may become increasingly restricted as more groups push for divestment in whatever industry or country they find objectionable. Furthermore, PSII’s demands would be costly. They would impose burdensome accounting costs on PRINCO simply to measure the environmental impact of every single company in which PRINCO has holdings either directly or indirectly. Moreover, portfolio allocation changes would impose costs that stem from selling large amounts of an investment, to say nothing of forgone potential returns from the investment. Furthermore, many investment structures employed in oil and natural gas extraction are entirely illiquid. Leaving these would entail substantial legal expenses and losses on the investment. On top of this, PRINCO’s operations going forward would be hampered by needing to examine the possible environmental impact of any company before taking a position on it. These problems would be multiplied, since the proposal mandates that PRINCO only employ external asset managers who follow the same restrictive policies. PRINCO does critical work for the University. The returns on the University’s endowment enable Princeton to grant generous financial aid packages to 60 percent of students. If these returns are threatened, then so too is Princeton’s ability to welcome all students, regardless of financial situation. PSII’s willingness to risk certain benefits for the sake of a misguided symbolic gesture is the mark of activist naïveté. Aditya Trivedi ’16 recused himself from the writing of this editorial. Jeffrey Leibenhaut ’16 and Jill Wilkowski ’15 abstained from this editorial. DISSENT: The majority opines that University divestment would have marginal effect on the finances of affected companies, and would thus be ineffective as a means of protest. While it is true that the withdrawal of Princeton’s investments cannot alone materially impact the financial performance of these companies, the majority’s position ignores the significance of divestment’s symbolic role. Divestment as a political strategy expresses principled discontent and exposes the environmentally irresponsible business practices of companies who profit by contributing to global warming. Given the University’s prominence in mainstream media and the public consciousness, employing its endowment as a means of social change is perhaps one of the strongest ways that it can institutionally convey dissent. In so doing, the University would play an important part in setting a precedent for other institutions of higher learning, following Stanford’s recent high-profile decision to divest from coal. By continuing to actively hold investments in environmentally-harmful corporations, the University may tacitly be placing its imprimatur on industries harmful to our planet. The same concern was the basis of the 2013 faculty petition to divest from companies that manufactured firearms. Furthermore, the majority’s claim that divestment would be unreasonably costly seems to be blown out of proportion. Though new reporting measures and asset liquidation would surely come at some cost, we feel that these expenses would be warranted given the importance and urgency of acting against climate change. As of this year, the University’s endowment stands at an enormous $21 billion, the highest for any university globally on a per capita basis, and one of the world’s largest in absolute terms. With this in mind, Princeton could likely afford to make portfolio changes without substantive effects to student life (or financial aid, as the majority claims).

80032|~|Letter to the editor: Concerning the Wendy Davis lecture|~|   February 26 2015|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Yesterday’s coverage of a lecture given by former Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis was entirely one-sided, recounting only her talking points. In abandoning all pretense of balance and in overlooking any tough questions asked of her following her talk, the ‘Prince’ failed to recognize that the content of Davis’s talk is controversial and subject to legitimate debate. Wendy Davis spent most of her lecture expounding the idea that expanding women’s reproductive choices, particularly abortion, is essential to guaranteeing women’s equality. Moreover, she alleged that many conservatives use these issues as mere political ploys while ignoring those who are affected. As a woman and president of Princeton Pro-Life, I strongly object to Davis’s claims. Her remarks grossly mischaracterize the pro-life movement in an astonishingly intolerant manner. I, and many Princetonians like me, oppose abortion because we sincerely believe that life begins at conception and that all human life has inherent dignity. Sadly, yesterday’s account of the lecture neglected to mention the controversial nature of the event. The ‘Prince’ neither mentioned my question challenging her problematic conception of gender equality nor the former state senator’s woefully inadequate response. As a result, the ‘Prince’ failed to recognize the diversity of thought among students, and women specifically, on campus. Presenting such differing viewpoints in a balanced manner is the duty of a respectable newspaper. I urge the ‘Prince’ to bear this in mind going forward as it continues to inform the Princeton community. Respectfully, Elly Brown ’18 President of Princeton Pro-Life|~|Editor’s Note: The Daily Princetonian’s coverage of public lectures is designed to report the substance of the speaker’s remarks. Though many speakers on campus discuss potentially controversial policy issues, it has been the practice of the ‘Prince’ to report on the speaker’s comments without necessarily invoking all sides of the debate. While questions or answers during the Q&A portion of a public lecture are sometimes quoted, the purpose of the coverage is primarily to report what the speaker said during the event. 
79979|~|Editorial: Reform the Referendum|~|   February 26 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Several weeks after its conclusion, Bicker remains the word on the street. Continued campus conversation about Bicker owes much to the recent “Hose Bicker” movement. While dialogue about Bicker reform is certainly worth having, the framing of the current referendum to end the Bicker system is problematic — and harmful — to productive conversation. Proponents of the “Hose Bicker” referendum shortsightedly narrow the conversation by setting the cart before the horse: they set the goal to eliminate Bicker and then propose the formation of a committee to work toward that specific end. The Board urges that the referendum be amended to remove its “end Bicker” formulation and instead simply propose the creation of an ad hoc committee to discuss all eating club member selection processes, not just Bicker. Attempting to reform private independent institutions through the Undergraduate Student Government is necessarily a futile enterprise. Eating clubs are private institutions, entirely outside USG’s limited jurisdiction. The most a referendum could achieve, therefore, is to stimulate a vigorous campus discussion about Bicker. However, the current referendum undermines this outcome in two ways: first, any conclusions drawn from the referendum results will come from skewed sample populations and limited data points; second, the referendum’s measures preempt discussion and polarize relevant participants. The results of the referendum are unlikely to reflect accurately the feelings of the entire University community due to the voluntary, non-random nature of the USG referenda voting. USG elections are often characterized by low voter turnout. For example, only 40 percent of the student body voted on this year’s winter break referendum, and this year’s presidential runoff election’s unusually high turnout featured just 3,116 votes. Elections plagued by low voter turnout often overrepresent extreme voices, thereby failing to represent moderate voices in the outcome. The practical reality of a limited participant pool is further complicated because different class years experience different facets of the eating club selection system, and USG voting participation is almost always uneven across class years. Going through with the USG referendum to end Bicker would place a rubber stamp on the view of a misrepresentative sample of the student body and skew the direction of the conversation. Proper discussion of the issue requires a framework that gathers the thoughts and opinions of all voices. Not only will the circumstances of the polling produce false conclusions, but the framing of the proposal polarizes relevant participants. The current wording of the referendum ballot includes a “call [for] each bicker eating club to end bicker not later than the first day of the 2019-2020 academic year” and directs, “the USG Senate to … establish an ad hoc committee to facilitate ending bicker.” This undermines campus discourse. The option presented is not, “What could we do about Bicker?” but rather, “Let’s eliminate this system.” This proposal casts its own final judgement and in so doing antagonizes those who support the Bicker process, including the officers of Bicker eating clubs. Many who participate and facilitate the Bicker system are put on the defensive, instead of welcomed to discuss the system’s merits. Eating club officers who best know the flaws of the system and can speak with more authority as to possible alternatives are almost inevitably estranged. Instead of assuming that the only issue left is the method by which to eliminate Bicker (which is again, beyond USG jurisdiction), the referendum could welcome the insights and experiences of eating club officers to understand fully the problems with Bicker and other membership selection mechanisms. Membership selection is done differently by every eating club on the Street, and the specific mechanisms and consequences of each system vary. Welcoming knowledgeable officers to the discussion table would help the community explore the issue thoroughly. An ad hoc committee with a broader scope than “facilitating the end of Bicker” could also contribute to better understanding the merits and faults of every club’s member selection systems. Bicker is a complex and contentious issue. All of us in the University community would do well to consider and discuss Bicker and potential reforms in a cooperative and fruitful manner. The current referendum falls short of this, and its authors and proponents would do well to modify their approach. Mitchell Johnston ’15 recused himself from the writing of this editorial.   Dissent: The majority opinion argues the referendum is faulty for two main reasons: the invalidity of the USG voting process and the referendum’s language itself. Both of these arguments are unsound. First, the majority argues that the polling process administered by USG fails to represent the entire student body. Yet the participant pool is “limited” not by a fault in this process (as the majority opines), but by the choices of students. Simply put, students, including upperclassmen in eating clubs, who want their voices heard can do so through the ballot box. Furthermore, why has the majority just now chosen to criticize the USG voting process? By its logic, the USG presidential election and the winter break referendum were unfairly decided. In addition, every class has an opinion on the Bicker system and will, at some point or another, be affected by Bicker. While underclassmen might not be in eating clubs now, 70 percent of them will be in two years. Thus as an aggregate, the referendum process is the best way to gauge student opinion across campus. Moreover, the majority criticizes the referendum’s language as overly sweeping and misaligned with proper campus discourse. In reality, if this referendum passes, campus opinion on Bicker will be clear. Every year around Bicker season, this campus discusses the faults of Bicker, yet fails to properly poll the student body or enact real change. Voting on this referendum will provide an adequate indicator of student opinion. The majority rightly points out that the clubs are independent, and we agree that the ad hoc committee should include more Bicker club representation. However, the USG voting process currently provides the best way of properly polling student opinion, in the actual results of the vote, the discussion the referendum has sparked, and the conversation to follow. Ultimately, the majority opinion trivializes the current conversation around the harms of Bicker, especially considering the majority’s silence on the plethora of alternatives to Bicker released by the “Hose Bicker” campaign this week.

79981|~|On keeping libraries open |~|   February 26 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Schwartz|~|   Opinion Editor     |~|There is a special sense of hopelessness that accompanies leaving the Trustee Reading Room in Firestone Library at 2 a.m., paper unfinished and coffee in hand. I’ve spent more nights than I would have liked searching for a quiet study space after the libraries have closed. During the regular academic year, Firestone closes at 11:45 p.m., while the Trustee Reading Room and Lewis Library remain open until 2 a.m. The University does not have a 24-hour library, so after 2 a.m., students are on their own. Granted, the University does have all-night study rooms, mainly in the residential colleges and upperclassman dorms. However, students have argued that that is not enough. In the recent Undergraduate Student Government “What Matters” campaign, students specifically identified a need for longer library hours. Sixty-two percent of poll responders wanted Firestone to be open 24 hours during midterms and finals, and 60 percent of poll responders wanted to expand Firestone’s hours, especially during exams and before Dean’s Date. It’s clear that students want at least one library with 24-hour access, especially during crunch times. Despite this student support, USG recently decided against pursuing this policy change due to the additional funding that would be required to support after-hours staff. Instead, they plan to “raise awareness of study spaces that are already available.” While some sort of study space map may be helpful, it does not fill the need that students have identified. A library is not just a study space; it provides so much more than just a quiet room. For instance, libraries act as safe environments; entry to Firestone requires a prox and is monitored by a security guard. Libraries provide reliable access to the books, computers and scanners that students often need to complete their work. In a Library Journal article about the growing popularity of 24-hour academic libraries, the library director of Whitman College, a small liberal arts college, explained the importance of 24-hour access: “Our students have come to depend upon the library being open. They all say that just knowing it is open is important. If they need a quiet place, or if they need to get a book, they know they can get it. I think especially at a residential liberal arts college the library as place is enormously important.” Unfortunately, 24-hour library access has long been a losing battle at the University. For over 10 years, USG has led multiple efforts to designate a 24-hour library study space. The initiatives have always been defeated. Administration raised concerns that keeping a campus library or libraries open 24 hours would compromise student safety, promote poor study habits and, most importantly, prove too expensive. As USG argued this time around, the University would have to pay for additional staff and the cost of utilities for the extra hours. However, it seems unlikely that keeping one library open 24 hours would be financially impossible for a school like the University. Most of the other Ivy League universities have longer library hours than we do, and several have libraries open 24/7. In order for us to do the same, we may not have to make any radical changes or incur radical costs. In a 2013 study of academic libraries’ transition to 24-hour schedules, several schools found they were able to successfully manage their operating costs by only being open 24 hours a day for several nights a week. Even keeping Firestone open for 24 hours once or twice a week — or only keeping one section of Firestone open 24 hours — would be a massive improvement over the current situation. Given over 10 years of pushback and inaction from the administration, it is understandable that USG has changed its tactics, and is no longer advocating for 24-hour library space. But, as the polls have shown, the need among the student body still exists. Hopefully, the University will respond to its students and consider keeping one library open 24 hours, even if it is only for one or two nights a week.|~|Sarah Schwartz is a history major from Silver Spring, Md.

79844|~|Eating Clubs: The Princeton Paradigm|~|   February 25 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Avaneesh Narla|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The recent discussion regarding Bicker has attracted much interest and discussion, but as much as I am glad that the dialogue is active, I’d like to present another question to the debate: Why do we still have Bicker? Or for that matter, eating clubs. Is it because Princeton students really do want it, or is it because it has always been so? Very recently, sophomores decided on their dining choices as upperclassmen in what will probably be one of the most critical decisions of their time at Princeton. And while there are many possible options (co-ops, residential colleges or going independent) for sophomores, it is always assumed that a student will most probably join an eating club. Any other option is an “alternative,” just as the vast majority of the job market is an “alternative choice” to “traditional” tech, finance or consulting careers for Princeton students. Joining an eating club is the default option, and you would need a good reason not to join one. Over the last two months, I have approached a lot of my friends with this question: “Why did you decide to join an eating club?” While most initial responses were based on preserving their groups of friends, I didn’t really understand how social circles were going to be preserved if they were going to be distributed without certainty in mostly selective (and arbitrary) eating clubs. After a few more rounds of prodding, most of my friends confessed that their decisions to join eating clubs were because it is an integral part of “the Princeton experience.” After all, the eating clubs are distinctive of Princeton and they are the most prominent of the social settings on campus, present since 1855. Alumni are recognized by their eating club affiliations as much as, if not more than, their concentrations. Thus, as a bid to be part of it, we perpetuate this Princeton tradition: a tradition of exclusive institutionalized social spaces that many students are critical of, but most of whom join anyway, out of resignation, because it is “the Princeton thing to do.” Parallels may be drawn to other historical institutions that were perpetuated merely because of the conformity of community members. The spectrum of these historical institutions includes extremes such as racially segregated restaurants, and speak of the need of community members to be self-critical. Even before being critical of eating clubs, I am critical of this attitude of conformity that joining an eating club is an integral part of “the Princeton experience.” Nearly a third of our current upperclassmen has decided not to join one, and I do not feel that we can invalidate their experiences in any way. And at the end of the day, “the Princeton experience” is what we make of it, not a blind subscription to historical precedents. After all, before 1969, the Princeton experience exclusively meant being male. If we take a step further back, I feel it is imperative to question the phenomenon of eating clubs. Should social spaces be closed? Should my ability to interact with someone be institutionalized? And if so, should the University sanction and support such institutions? (Though located outside the University, Princeton extends a lot of resources to the eating clubs such as technological support and institutional collaboration.) Most retort against the selectivity and exclusivity of eating clubs by saying that Princeton itself is selective. But Princeton is an academic institution with limited academic and physical resources. Princeton admitted 50 students more than expected in 2012 and had to make many adjustments in order to accommodate everyone. But the primary resource that eating clubs offer are social spaces (the significance of physical spaces and other resources offered by eating clubs can be questioned) and the numbers they admit are often arbitrary; so is the selectivity justified? The effect of size on social dynamics of communities and its relevance must be questioned. Through campaigns such as Hose Bicker, it is important for the Princeton community to reflect on the role and impact of eating clubs in Princeton. But I feel it is even more significant for each individual to evaluate what they truly want from the Princeton experience, including their choice of dining for the next year. Thus, I ask Princeton sophomores to think carefully before deciding to spend around $10,000 to join an exclusive institutionalized social space. Or before deciding to cook or buy meals regularly. But I hope that we make our Princeton experience what we want it to be, not what we were told it should be.|~|Avaneesh Narla is a sophomore from Kolkata, India.

79849|~|In loco parentis|~|   February 25 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Reva Abrol|~|   Contributor     |~|Apparently, some 24-hour bug has been going around for the past few weeks. I unfortunately know this firsthand, not because I have the stomach flu (yet), but because I recently had to stomach the effects of someone else’s flu. At the end of my seminar class one recent evening, as I casually started toward the door, I looked up just in time to see one of my classmates lurching towards the landfill section of the classroom garbage bin. There, in front of an audience of four traumatized students and one traumatized professor, he released the contents of his dinner all over that poorly designed can. We all pleadingly turned toward our instructor’s authority, awaiting some call to action, some directive, some reassurance — but most importantly, some relief from the putrid smell that permeated the air. My professor stopped to let pass a moment of fleeting concern, then said: “Uh… Can someone call University Health Services? I have to catch a train back to New York.” And with that, she left the room. I was dumbfounded. Was she going to leave the four of us to handle this mess on our own? Did she feel no obligation to at least call for help herself? Did she feel no responsibility toward the welfare of her students? I temporarily stifled my confusion to make a smooth exit through the door, throwing one last pitiful glance at the kid bent over the trashcan. Another student was helping him up and I wasn’t about to stick around any longer than I had to. This might seem hypocritical, given that I had just judged my professor and all, but I’m only eighteen, and the sight of vomit still makes me want to vomit. Besides, my responsible, adult professor was the one with the obligation to help out that poor kid, right? Later, I thought about it more and decided: maybe not. Our modern understanding of in loco parentis, the concept that a temporary caretaker of a child takes on all or some of the responsibilities of a parent, is often applied to primary and secondary educational institutions, where the recipients of care fit the legal definition of a child. However, in his 2011 article, Phillip Lee of Harvard University revisits in loco parentis as exercised in the American university, stating that, prior to the 1960s, “[the] doctrine allowed universities to exercise great discretion in developing the ‘character’ of their students without respect to their students’ constitutional rights,” thereby subjecting university students to heavy regulation of their private affairs. Criticism of these regulatory practices by student movements of the 1960s led to the general dissolution of this concept in higher education. Today, university students supervise themselves. On campus, the student, although subjected to and responsible for abiding by university policy, has no true parental figure. So then, why do we sometimes treat our professors — representatives of the University — like parents? Maybe it’s a first-year phenomenon or the result of lingering impressions made on us during our secondary education; perhaps it’s some weird complex that explains why you accidentally called your teacher “Mom” that one time — but the enduring notion that professors are supervisors is a threat to our progress as scholars and independent, critical thinkers. While professors are undeniably authority figures, this authority derives from the value we place on their academic prowess, not from the authority we merely assume in an individual who occupies a teaching position. When we give importance to the position rather than the reason behind the position, we forget the principal purpose that professors serve: to motivate, enlighten and inspire inquiry. To treat your professor as only your guardian and never your peer in an academic environment is to hinder your ability to take your potential for agency, contribution or refutation seriously. Although professors deserve respect for the invaluable knowledge and guidance they provide, they should not be seen as infallible parents — this image is harmful for both you and them. Just as much as professors are permitted to pass on dealing with the kid who just puked (which they are), you are permitted to question the soundness of their ideas or offer methods to improve discourse in a classroom. Accepting the idea that your professor can also be a peer is a step toward growing up and taking on responsibility, both in life and in academics.|~|Reva Abrol is a freshman from Syosset, NY.

79623|~|Where we are on sustainability|~|   February 24 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|There really aren’t any shortcuts on Princeton campus. For a student body whose day-to-day activity involves quite a lot of walking and biking, it seems like there’s never enough time for the trek from Frick Chemistry Laboratory to East Pyne. The new construction and renovation projects scattered around campus certainly don’t make those ten minutes between classes any easier. What many students don’t know is that these new buildings represent something that we should be proud of — the University’s commitment to sustainability. As featured on the Sustainability at Princeton website, the Olden House, home to visiting faculty, is energy and water-efficient; the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment will host green roofs, rain gardens and heat recovery systems in spring 2015; and the Arts and Transit Project currently in the works will have geothermal heat pumps, biofiltration systems and daylighting control. In its goals to reduce waste and energy, the dining halls went tray-free; Café Vivian introduced a reusable container program; over 180 “Drink Local” bottle-filling stations were installed; a 5.3-megawatt solar array was established — providing about 8% of the electricity on campus last year — and the University joined the Billion Dollar Green Challenge. According to Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Public Affairs David Wilcove, when he came to Princeton 13 years ago, “sustainability in the context of what we do on campus was barely a concern, but [the Office of Sustainability] and the University community have done an impressive job.” It’s nice to know that the University isn’t taking shortcuts in this area. While the new projects and buildings reflect an effort to “stimulate transformational thinking and exceptional performance in sustainability,” the same can’t be said for the University’s endowment thus far. Despite the University’s monitoring of its on-campus ecological footprint, it has not integrated these values of environmental ethics and transparency in its investment practices, which may support environmentally irresponsible companies. In 2011, the College Sustainability Report Card, an online evaluation of campus and endowment policies at leading institutions, published its last review of the University’s sustainability profile. The University had received an A in all categories — eight perfect scores — except for endowment transparency, in which it received a D. The survey indicated that the University neither incorporated school community feedback into proxy voting decisions nor did it give access to information on endowment holdings to the school community or general public. Instead, according to the website survey, most of these rights were reserved for the trustees, senior administrators and certain select individuals. Furthermore, donors could not choose to direct their gifts to specific investment funds, as policy states that they have to invest in the endowment as a whole. According to a Feb. 27 article in The Daily Princetonian about Students United for a Responsible Global Environment petitioning for divestment, University spokesperson Martin Mbugua said, “regarding specific investments, we do not discuss the specifics of our endowment portfolio in order to retain a competitive advantage in the financial market.” The Report Card reported that “approximately one in five schools makes lists of endowment holdings available to the campus community, and in many cases, the public, [whether these lists were] kept at the investment office, sent upon request or posted on a website.” While being part of the four out of five might not seem like the gravest of sins, the University’s low rating in this category hardly upholds its values as a leading academic institution. By withholding information about how the endowment is managed and distributed, the University stifles dialogue in the college community. Considering the number of environmentally conscious student organizations on campus, the University hardly does the students a favor in excluding them from the conversation and from representation in proxy votes on investment holdings. Since then, student bodies and faculties from across the country have been debating whether universities should divest their endowments from fossil-fuel companies. In 2013, the Princeton Association of New York City hosted a panel discussion on energy, the environment and the endowment, featuring panelists Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs, and Peter Singer, professor of bioethics. They considered relevant questions such as what divestment and its impact could mean for an institution such as Princeton that maintains a large endowment and what kinds of alternatives might exist. A year later, a group of undergraduate and graduate students, along with faculty, staff and alumni, came together to form the Princeton Sustainable Investment Initiative. “Last September,” said Soumya Sudhakar ’18, coordinator of PSII, “400,000 people plus a large contingent of the Princeton community marched in New York City, demanding action on climate change. Basically people care about climate change and want to respond — PSII is doing just that.” PSII proposed that the University become a member of the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, which would push the University to demand risk disclosure from the companies they invest in, encourage investors to address long-term sustainability within their portfolios and report on endowment allocation to the school community and general public. PSII also proposed that the University sign the Carbon Disclosure Project, which would further inform the University on the environmental profile of their investments and encourage these companies to steer away from practices that contributed to environmental degradation. “If elite universities divest from fossil fuels and take steps to reduce their own emissions,” Singer explained, “there is a chance that others will take notice and attitudes will change.” Perhaps the most significant of PSII’s proposal was the creation of an annual report that would track the carbon footprint of the endowment and the development of a representative committee that could oversee and guide the management of the endowment toward “a set of environmentally and financially responsible investment guidelines.” PSII referred to two precedents in its proposal, citing the cases of South Africa and Darfur as examples in which “the University [had] taken actions that advanced far-reaching, successful movements and separated Princeton from assets that conflicted with its values.” Whether it was the campaign for divestment from apartheid South Africa in 1985, from companies associated with the genocide in Darfur in 2006 or from West Bank and Gaza in 2014, Princeton students have been on the frontlines of debate. They have established student organizations such as the Princeton Coalition for Endowment Responsibility and informational websites such as www.princetondivests.org. Beyond the maturity of staying informed and informing others, the student body has also demonstrated resourcefulness in creating effective platforms with supporters, drafting initiative proposals to present to Resources Committees and most of all, infiltrating a system that has managed to exclude many affected parties from the debate. As Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town Desmond Tutu wrote in his June 2010 article in The World Post, “principled stands … are essential for a better world in the making and it is always an inspiration when young people lead the way and speak truth to power.”  It is therefore PSII’s mission to ensure that Princeton extends these ethics into its sustainability agenda when managing the endowment. As the proposal states, “a University that acts contrary to its values sets a model of unethical behavior before its students and the world.” Thus far, the Initiative has been endorsed by University faculty, staff and several student organizations including Greening Dining, the Princeton Wilderness Society, Princeton Animal Welfare Society, The Princeton Progressive, SURGE and Innovation: Princeton Journal of Science and Technology. Thus far, the main concerns student organizations have had were about what it would mean to endorse the Initiative as a student group in terms of additional responsibilities in taking a public stance on a policy change. Thus far, most initiatives have involved the support of individual students, so some student organizations that have been approached wondered whether they had that responsibility as an organization to participate. However, with the diverse representation of the student body behind the Initiative, it is clear to see that it is everyone’s responsibility to care about and respond to the ethical stance that the University takes in managing the endowment, especially when this stance facilitates environmental degradation. “What’s most important is for the University to have an open and specific set of guidelines that investors need to adhere to that takes into account the concerns of the University community,” Oppenheimer explained. “We shouldn’t be treating each investment on an ad hoc basis, in which it’s a different outcome each time and an indefensible one at that.” It therefore appears that now may be the best time for the Initiative and for students to be demanding representation and accountability from the University in the transparency of its endowment. “The campus is in the midst of its planning for the next 10 years,” said Leigh Anne Schreiver ’16, coordinator of PSII. “It seems like the perfect moment to encourage sustainability and environmental protection in every aspect of Princeton’s vision for the future.”|~|
79644|~|Beyond bicker: An alternative vision of club admissions|~|   February 24 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Joseph LoPresti ’15 On Monday, Barbara Zhan ’16 wrote an article arguing that Bicker is necessary. The students working on the Hose Bicker campaign — a large group that includes students who have been hosed, who got into Bicker clubs and who never bickered at all — appreciated her articulate response. However, her arguments fail to stand up under scrutiny. First, Zhan ignores the inherent role of social rejection in the Bicker process — and the harm that this rejection causes. It is nice to believe that Bicker participants should “reject the idea that Bicker is indicative of self-worth.” Many Bicker supporters similarly claim that rejection is just a part of life, especially for Princeton students. Of course, colleges and jobs also reject some applicants, but the kind of public social rejection Bicker encourages — indeed, requires — is uniquely harmful. Bicker necessarily relies on social rejection and, in particular, on fostering a belief that admitted sophomores have demonstrated their social worthiness for club membership — an implicit expression that hosed sophomores have demonstrated their social unworthiness. The responsibility of dismissing this rejection should not be placed on hosed students. Second, Zhan neglects to acknowledge how self-selecting the eating clubs already are. Bicker is not necessary to maintain a club’s “culture and personality” — sign-in clubs have cultures and personalities as well. If anything, Bicker undermines a unified club culture by forcing members of Bicker clubs to compete against one another to get their friends into the club. Third, she assumes that Bicker is a logical system that effectively if not perfectly identifies the students who “fit” in a given club. Certainly, a club admission process should help prospective members determine whether they fit the culture of a club. But Bicker is an inadequate system for making such a determination. Bicker votes are often based on who members already know, more a measure of other affiliations than of fit. Evaluating other prospective members comes down to a few short conversations and a late-night vote, neither giving enough time nor enough consideration to evaluate their “fit” for the club. Fourth, Zhan assumes that the only alternative to Bicker is a lottery system, which she finds unfairly arbitrary. It is true that a lottery is arbitrary — although Bicker’s reliance on low information voting makes it nearly as arbitrary as a lottery. However, she is not correct in saying that a lottery is the only alternative to bicker. In fact, many alternatives exist that would be fairer, less arbitrary and more effective than Bicker. The most prominent alternative is a system already in use by Charter: the points system. Prospective members earn points by attending events at the club and those with the most points get in. A points system is a far better way of fostering “club culture” and determining “fit” than Bicker: prospective members would get to see whether they feel comfortable at a club, and members would get to know prospective members without the time pressures of brief Bicker sessions of the social pressures of trying to get their friends into the club. A points system could have many variations. For example, a club could set a “point limit” that a prospective member must reach in order to enter a lottery, combining the best aspects of both systems. Or it could use a “ranking and optimization” system like the one used to allocate residencies to medical students: sophomores rank their club preferences, the clubs submit a list of sophomores ordered by number of points or by lottery, and an algorithm chooses the optimal distribution of sophomores based on these two sets of preferences. These reforms could be accompanied by other attributes to make the system more transparent and less arbitrary. Elimination of Bicker should be coupled with the re-introduction of “ironclad” groups. In an ironclad, a group of friends signs up to participate in the club admission process together, with the entire group receiving the same admission decision. Ironclads could easily fit into a points system. Additionally, a new system should make sure that points-eligible events are advertised to all sophomores to prevent members from allowing only certain sophomores to consider their club. At Princeton, we receive a world-class liberal arts education that, in theory, teaches us how to approach seemingly impossible problems and find solutions to them — problems that are far more complex than Bicker. Our first reaction to Bicker should not be that there is nothing else we can do. Clearly, there are several alternatives to the status quo, including possible alternatives not yet devised. None of our alternatives are perfect, but all of them are better than the enshrined social rejection inherent to the Bicker process. The Hose Bicker campaign is first and foremost about starting a dialogue about what we would be willing to change in order to create a more inclusive campus. Encouraging the clubs to discuss what alternatives would be best for them is a key part of that. Princeton is better than Bicker, and the sooner we replace it with any of the feasible alternatives that exist, the better.|~|Joe LoPresti can be contacted at jalopres@princeton.edu. 
79516|~|Temporary Utopia|~|   February 23 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Steve Swanson|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I finally realized that something was amiss when I was rudely awakened by sirens for the third night in a row. The uneasy feeling that I had so successfully repressed while searching for the apartment, signing the lease, and moving myself in finally manifested itself as a low, visceral ache in my gut and a whispered refrain: “you’re out of your depth.” Out of my depth? The notion seemed absurd: three years of education at the nation’s top university and I didn’t know how to rent an apartment? And yet, there I was, stuck with a three-month lease for an apartment whose leaky plumbing, shoddy wiring and crime-ridden surroundings made themselves apparent within a week. It was no one’s fault but my own, of course: just as the man who shows up to a used car lot with no prior research will find himself driving out in a twenty-year-old Corolla, the man who fails to do due diligence before signing a lease will end up in an apartment complex where people get murdered for their Vietnam War medals. To quote Robocop: “that’s life in the big city.” But it sure isn’t life in Princeton. Within the Orange Bubble, over 98 percent of undergraduate students obtain their housing through the University. Say what you will about the inequities of room draw, but it is a far cry from the real housing market, where shifty salesmen and prevaricating landlords will do their best to fleece unsuspecting customers. My own poorly-researched summer lease worked out fine, giving me some funny stories and some much-needed perspective, but it illustrated to me a larger point: life at Princeton had not at all prepared me for life in the mythical Real World. Housing is just the tip of the iceberg, too: thanks to Princeton’s tireless efforts to make this campus a safer and easier place to live, it is now possible for students to graduate without ever going through the hassle of signing a lease, buying or making their own food, interacting with non-college educated people, dealing with the dangers of crime, using a physical key or any number of other skills made redundant by the University’s services. Because of both external pressures and, I believe, a genuine desire to make life better for its students, Princeton may have inadvertently crossed the line between supporting and coddling us. The role of higher education in public life seems to be in a state of flux, especially as the rate of people seeking degrees has so drastically expanded in recent decades: to some, secondary education exists to teach the new generation “how to think,” by instilling values and asking hard questions; to others, it is a four year excursion to “find oneself” through new experiences and acquaintances; still others believe that colleges and universities ought to be training grounds for marketable skills, the end goal of which is employment. There are a number of arguments for these and other viewpoints, and each of the thousands of schools in the United States has a slightly different belief in what it should be giving its students. The commonality between these views, though, is that a college or university takes in students unprepared for the world — mentally, personally or technically — and fills in the necessary gaps. All else being equal, then, any institution of higher education should be outputting graduates as prepared for adult life as possible. With this in mind, the cheery, safe, low-consequence world that Princeton creates for us in the end does us a disservice. No matter how well-constructed the Utopia that the school works towards is, it only lasts us four short years — after which we are rudely thrown into a bare-knuckle world with no training. This is what makes summer experiences and semesters abroad so valuable: students are able to escape the University’s mothering and see what will be expected of them once their four year dream is over. But it shouldn’t be the case that students’ most educational experiences occur only when they are free of the University’s loving shackles. What might the University do to fix its inadvertent stunting of students’ growth? Because the current way of doing things is so entrenched in campus culture, it would be difficult to substantively change the dining plan or housing system, but ideally a number of small policy changes could better instill the idea that students ought to be responsible, trustworthy adults. Offering courses in real-world skills would also at least show students that there exist these gaps in their knowledge. Most importantly, though, administrators and professors (as well as students themselves) should constantly be aware that the vast majority of the student body is comprised of adults: people above the age of eighteen who are, in the eyes of the law, fully responsible for their own actions and inactions. I believe that people act as they are treated — and will get away with anything they are allowed to — so only students treated as morally, legally and socially responsible adults will act as such. However it is done, it is imperative that the University and its students understand that learning how to function as an adult is infinitely more valuable than a few fleeting years in paradise.|~|Steve Swanson is a Computer Science major from Vienna, Va.

79513|~|It's a party - RSVP required|~|   February 23 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Let’s throw it back to our Founding Fathers. In his farewell address, George Washington admonished against the rise of political parties. He got it right. Parties serve as a distraction, drawback and danger to constructive dialogue, and he tried to warn us with an uncanny prescience. John Adams would likewise warn against a “division of the republic” with the introduction of a two-party system in a letter to Jonathan Jackson. But we did not listen. We implemented the same two-party structure that our Founding Fathers foresaw and cautioned against, but it has evolved from a simple dichotomy between two political parties into an ideological war that extends beyond Democrats and Republicans, or liberals and conservatives. Ultimately this has led to inbred divisions and political polarization, not only on the national stage, but on our own campus as well. These dichotomies conspicuously manifest between groups such as Princeton Democrats and College Republicans, Whig and Clio, “The Princeton Progressive” and “The Princeton Tory,” Princeton Committee on Palestine and Tigers for Israel. Even more organizations, such as Model UN, debate and Students United for a Responsible Global Environment, supplement the divisive nature of the aforementioned groups. The inclusive yet exclusionary nature of our political culture was made apparent to me at the last Whig-Clio Senate debate on police brutality. Retrospectively, I realized that some of the most politically active and interested, even zealous, students on campus used this as a platform to develop and articulate already-established views. I couldn’t help but notice that the attendees belonged to either to Whig or to Clio, and as indecisive as some were at the start of the debate, everyone ended up on one side or the other by the end. These are the future Princeton-grad politicians, lawmakers and lobbyists, yet they had already ceded to the impossibility of cross-party compromise. The political groups on campus perpetuate the notion of a warped two-party system, since participants in the system generally have to be on one side or the other. There is no room for third parties, just as in the United States political field. There is no room for the curious case of the “socially liberal, fiscally conservative.” There is no room for the far-left or far-right. There is no room for the non-politics, history, economics or Woodrow Wilson School majors. This not only serves to polarize people on both sides, but to alienate those who do not conform to this dichotomous structure. And there is no room for the politically disinterested yet aware — those who remain cognizant of political news but simply aren’t as invested in political affairs as many others on campus. These individuals may not side with one particular party or side, or they may not care enough to commit to one side’s philosophy. Or perhaps they simply don’t have fully formulated political views. After all, according to a survey conducted by “Reason” magazine on 2000 Millennials (aged 18 to 29), our generation’s views are totally incoherent and constantly evolving. As foreshadowed by John Adams, we are now witnessing the division of a campus and student body. So many students have grown disillusioned with the political atmosphere today that they are choosing to dissociate themselves from politics on campus (and nationally). As pointed out in “Salon” magazine, “Millennials have lived most of their lives within a historically toxic partisan climate — for many, it’s the only kind of politics they’ve ever known. Without a compelling reason to expect this to change any time soon, young people are opting to disengage from politics entirely.” While this is representative of a national trend, it is imperative that we look introspectively to realize how much our political culture has and can continue to hurt dialogue on campus. This political hyper-inclusivity not only bars a certain group of people from participating, but it prevents any sort of consensus from being reached and obstructs positive change on campus that does not solely look to the opinions vocalized by a few. I am guilty of being a partisan, politically active student who loves being in the middle of rigorous debate, and I am grateful and amazed by the extent of political and social activism on campus. Nevertheless, we can do better to introduce a greater diversity of opinion and background into campus politics in an effort to engender more constructive, less divisive dialogue.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

79511|~|On Study Abroad|~|   February 23 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Coy Ozias|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Princeton’s unofficial motto states “in the nations service and the service of all nation.” However, are all nations equally in need of our service? Are there certain nations in which the University should direct greater effort and aid? The United States Department of State recognizes thirteen critical foreign languages as part of the National Security Language Initiative. These languages are less commonly studied in the US but are vital to national security, including Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Punjabi, Russian, Turkish and Urdu. Right now, the government is in need of Americans who have proficient knowledge of these languages and the area and culture in which they are spoken. Through the NSLI for Youth, and the Critical Language Scholarship, the State Department offers fully funded intensive language study abroad trips for both high school and college students. These languages are spoken in hotbed areas of American politics such as the Middle East and Asia. Some of which are plagued with war, political discord and economic ruin. In order to best serve and interact with these nations, these countries need people who can speak their language and live in their culture. The government has deemed these nations to be in need of our nation’s service, but does Princeton agree? Princeton currently offers study abroad programs in only three of these thirteen critical language areas: Princeton in St. Petersburg (Russian), Princeton in Beijing (Chinese), and Princeton in Ishikawa (Japanese). While Princeton does offer language programs in 8 different countries overall, these programs should be expanded to include more critical languages. Granted, some regions such as Syria, Iraq and Iran are unrealistic for study abroad programs due to war, internal conflict and travel restrictions — and that’s understandable. The University should never put its students at risk; there probably won’t be a Princeton in Afghanistan any time soon. Princeton isn’t able to (nor is it expected to) overcome political restrictions or physical dangers that threaten us all. However, there are tons of regions where both American travel is permitted and safety of students would be ensured. While the University cannot be expected to sponsor trips to Syria, it can send Arabic students to Jordan, Oman or Morocco. Instead of going to Iran, students can study Persian in Tajikistan. The knowledge gained in these countries could prepare a student for work in more dangerous areas of the world upon graduation. Right now the US needs people willing to cross cultural, linguistic and religious barriers, who are willing to interact with people and find solutions to problems between countries that are largely a product of miscommunication. This is where Princeton can play a helpful role. Princeton should encourage its students to study these languages and cultures and travel to these areas. However, the current study abroad programs seem to do the opposite, discouraging students from visiting these regions and studying these important foreign languages. At the moment, studying a language like German or French is much more attractive to students. A student interested in studying Arabic will have much more difficulty studying abroad in country like Jordan than a German or French learner would have if they wanted to study their language abroad. First of all, students studying German have the convenience of applying to a Princeton program in which they will be with other Princeton students and assured credit. However, a student studying Arabic is forced to search for programs outside of the University that may not offer credit. More importantly many of these programs are very expensive, harming students on financial aid, who may not be able to afford to go. Some of these non-Princeton programs can cost upwards of $12,000 for an 8-week study abroad trip. Even if one received the max aid available through SAFE, it would barely cover half of the cost! This fact keeps many students interested in critical languages from going abroad who may have been able to do so if they had studied abroad through a Princeton program. With all of these difficulties and barriers, it is easy to see why Princeton students may be deterred from studying those languages at Princeton which are not paired with official study abroad programs. If Princeton were to offer more programs in these critical languages, it would increase the incentive to learn these difficult, yet very important languages. This not only helps increase our greater campus diversity, but would also help produce a generation of students with enhanced understanding and cultural sensibility to these important areas of the world. To truly be in the “service of all nations” Princeton has to help create students that can offer service to nations that are truly in need of it. Turkey and India are in much more need of our nation’s service than Germany or France. Princeton should help encourage students to gain the skills necessary to enhance relations with these countries.|~|Coy Ozias is a freshman from Christiansburg, Va.

79332|~|Editorial: Campus speakers and diversity of thought|~|   February 22 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Last week, the Wilson School hosted former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, as well as Dr. Willie Parker, one of the last physicians performing abortions in Mississippi, to deliver lectures in Robertson Hall. This week, on Wednesday, the Wilson School will welcome last year’s Texan Democrat gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis to campus for another such University-sponsored lecture. In response to the appearance of these high-profile liberal figures, a number of students on campus have expressed concerns over a perceived liberal homogeneity among invited speakers. Whether or not allegations of a liberal campus orthodoxy have merit, the Editorial Board recognizes the value of diversity of thought on campus and encourages the University to take active measures to encourage constructive debate. Diversity of thought is critical for the project of a university. It is through the respectful clash of ideas that productive dialogue, mutual understanding and learning occur. This is not to endorse any and all ideology — and certainly not those ideologies that are inimical to fair-minded conversation (such as racism or hate of persons). But reasonable people of goodwill can disagree — and very often they do, especially on difficult questions of faith, morals and politics. These tough questions should be discussed and debated at the University with due balance and tolerance. We propose two specific ways in which the University can foster diversity of thought at University-sponsored lectures. First, the University and its various departments should host more panel events with groups of scholars representing different views. Arranging more independent panel events and faculty panels after guest lectures would be especially conducive to robust debate and dialogue. Secondly, we suggest that University lecture coordinators adopt a better format for Q&A sessions at politically-charged talks than the common system of having questioners form lines behind microphones toward the front of the venue. The University already hosts a number of panel events, but more would be welcome. Such public discussions help to generate a salutary diversity of thought, provided that scholars of different viewpoints from both the Princeton faculty and the greater academic community are selected. Even at major single-speaker events, more could be done to encourage the fruitful clash of ideas. Q&A sessions following a speaker’s remarks allow the audience to engage with speakers in a way that can prove illuminating for all. However, this beneficial outcome is only obtained when a variety of questions are asked. Following Secretary Sebelius’s lecture last week, a group of College Republicans stormed the microphones to ask a litany of confrontational questions, thereby preventing many unaffiliated students from asking their own pressing questions. Similarly, at the conclusion of Dr. Willie Parker’s talk the next day, a large group of pro-choice graduate students and College Democrats rushed to the microphones to ask friendly questions. In so doing, they prevented many pro-life students from asking their questions. Clearly, this Q&A format is prone to abuse. Single groups monopolizing Q&A sessions narrows the critical conversation and limits the educational value of University events. We propose instead that Q&A sessions be conducted by alternating between questions from those lined up at the microphones and those randomly chosen from the audience by a neutral moderator or by the speaker. This would ensure a balance between the questions of those who take the initiative to get to the microphones and the questions of others who do not make it to the head of the line — whether because of an unfortunate middle-of-the-row seat or because they did not come with a prepared question. Such a format, we believe, would greatly help to bring differing ideas into conversation and enliven the educative experience of these lectures in general. Through a diversity of thought, the best ideas may triumph.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief. 
79330|~|AP U.S. History the Beautiful|~|   February 22 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|There are many things that I worried about as a 16-year-old high school sophomore. As a junior at Princeton University, most of those concerns seem irrelevant now, if I can recall what they were at all. Still, there have been moments on campus — from late-night chats with my friends to guest speaker talks to simply interesting lectures — that have brought me back to yesteryear. This happened most recently in the tiny Computer Science Building hall at the start of my American Politics lecture. We were discussing American traditions of liberalism and republicanism, and the dissonance between them and the historic exclusion of whole groups — like African-Americans, women and immigrants. Our professor posed the question, “How do we understand extensive periods of slavery, genocide, legalized racial and gender inequality and xenophobia within the context of our democratic values?” It’s an important question to answer: how do we reconcile our Founding Fathers’ convictions about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness with the knowledge that essentially no one but white, land-owning males had any of the three? My mind could have wandered to many different places as this complex issue was presented to a room full of undergraduates, but it jumped immediately to my AP U.S. History course. Although I can now safely say it was one of my favorite and most critical classes in high school, it wasn’t always so. In fact, had you asked me if I was excited to take the course before enrolling, I would have shaken my head and run for the hills. History had always seemed so cut-and-dried, very “first this happened, then this happened, and that’s how we got here!” Furthermore, the class had a reputation of being one of the hardest, most demanding courses in our school’s honors/AP program. In the end, it was one of the most challenging courses I took in high school. However, I was perfectly okay with this,because after a year’s worth of lectures, class discussions, essays and projects, I realized there was absolutely nothing cut-and-dried about history. Many factors contributed to this new insight, but the most important was the way in which my awesome teacher presented the thought-provoking curriculum of the course. It was obvious why many of my other history courses had seemed so bland: The perspectives from which we had studied past events were so narrow. This had nothing to do with the quality of teachers I had, but rather the textbooks around which they had to make lesson plans. Textbooks where both important and controversial parts of our history — such as the Trail of Tears, the bedrock of slavery in the agrarian south as well as the exploitation of immigrants in the industry-driven north, the important role women played in the Progressive Era, just to name a few — were glazed over, if mentioned at all. I understand that, realistically, every period of American history cannot be covered in a semester. I also understand that many of our country’s historical events and ideologies may be too complex to bring into a fifth- or even 11th-grade classroom. Still, I think it would be naïve at best to not realize that there are events that are systematically skipped over in U.S. History courses, no matter the year. An example is the U.S.-Mexican War, the story of the region, Tejas (i.e. Texas) and compulsorily drawn boundaries leading to the geographic behemoth America is today. Recently talking about all this in my Latinos in American Life course, I felt a twinge of shame as I realized it was only the second time I had discussed the topic — the first being in AP U.S. History. Suddenly I was feeling immensely grateful for the countless number of angles to American history that this high school course had provided me, while being disappointed that it was the only one that endeavored to do so. Imagine my extreme disappointment, then, when I found out last week that an education committee in Oklahoma approved a bill that would replace the AP U.S. history curriculum, all because the legislators believe the course paints America in a negative light. Painting America in a negative light should never be a concern. Every day, the people of America prove their tenacity and will to thrive in the framework upon which this country was built. Furthermore, I would have no understanding of the framework or appreciation for its founders without AP U.S. History — in which my first assignment was to read 1776, a retelling of the birth of America and the perseverance and courage of those who brought it about. We live through the greatness of American history every day of the present. But just as we live through the feats of our country, so too do we have the face the follies. Courses like AP U.S. History do not paint America in a negative light. They shine lights on all parts of our story as a nation, all peoples who tell the story from a different vantage point. Only when we respect and recognize this divergent recounting can we make our story of forward movement one of unity.|~|Lea Trusty is a Wilson School major from Saint Rose, La.

79328|~|Why Bicker is necessary|~|   February 22 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|There has been a recent initiative on campus in the form of a petition to call forth a referendum to end Bicker in the Princeton eating clubs. The referendum calls for eating clubs to end Bicker by the 2019-20 academic year and to establish an Undergraduate Student Government committee, which must include a non-voting member appointed by the Interclub Council, to facilitate the process. Although an initiative to  familiarize students with the downsides of Bicker and to introduce to students all available alternatives would be valuable, Bicker still ultimately has a place on this campus. The fact that there is a need to hose students indicates that there is a demand for certain eating clubs and no way to fulfill that demand. As long as the number of people who want to join certain clubs exceeds the capacity of those clubs, there will be a need for Bicker. Although having a lottery system would be a technically feasible way to allocate membership when there is an excess of students bickering, a lottery system would defeat the purpose of having individual, unique eating clubs. Each eating club facilitates its own culture and personality, which is a large part of the draw for each of these clubs. Although Terrace Club implements the lottery system to address its lack of capacity issues, it is not unreasonable for clubs to choose Bicker as a way of maintaining their culture. It makes sense to choose people based on fit in order to maintain the culture and personality that made the club so desired in the first place. The claim that Bicker divides friend groups is a valid concern. It’s true that meal exchanges don’t mitigate the social distance separating different eating clubs, since meal exchanges don’t cover the other social events that eating clubs host. It’s true that being in different eating clubs may mean that friendships change, especially if friends don’t make the effort to stay close. Ultimately though, the main objective of eating clubs is not to accommodate every student who wants to join and to make sure they feel comfortable and safe and wanted; rather, the objective is to foster a community of people with similar interests and, unfortunately, using a lottery system would be at odds with that objective. There are other alternatives, such as sign-in clubs, co-ops and other avenues to join a social community that don’t involve bickering. There are other ways to keep in touch with friends in different clubs, such as meal exchanges, dining swipes for upperclassmen and guest meals. These alternatives may not be as ideal as joining the same club as  friends and being able to eat together every single day, but making sure every single student feels comfortable is not a feasible goal for the eating clubs. It is simply impossible for them to keep everybody happy given capacity limitations, so the goal they strive for when using Bicker as a membership selection method is to foster a cohesive culture. The most difficult part of being hosed is the feeling that it is indicative of you as a person. It’s all too easy to believe that is the case — although I’ve never bickered, I know that gut-sinking feeling of failing a fit interview for an internship and thinking that it’s because I’m inherently an unlikeable, unworthy person. I know friends who weren’t accepted to their top-choice sorority and friends who’ve been hosed from their desired eating clubs. It’s difficult to deal with, knowing that you were judged solely on your personality. However, rejection is not necessarily a commentary on your personality: it may indicate only that you were not the right fit for the company or the sorority or the eating club or that there was simply not enough space. We commonly hold the mentality that we want to be the best at everything and be accepted by everything we apply to. Although it may be hard to see after being hosed by an eating club, often there is another place that will turn out to be a better fit in the end. While “Hose Bicker” would be a way to protect students from feeling like Bicker is a judgment of their character, it is not a feasible course of action for the eating clubs. A better way to help students reach this understanding is to facilitate conversation that helps students genuinely reject the idea that Bicker is indicative of self-worth. This is the conversation that needs to be had on campus: not an abolishment of Bicker, but an understanding of why Bicker is necessary and what hosing means — helping students find places that are better fits for them personally — and what it doesn’t mean — that a person is unlikeable.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

79153|~|Concussion awareness on campus|~|   February 19 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By David Goldstein ’17 As someone who has endured multiple concussions, has founded and continued to manage a comprehensive Countywide Concussion Care program, and has helped pass youth concussion legislation in Florida, I saw an immense amount of value in the wise words and lessons that were shared at the Concussions in Youth Sports Discussion on Sept. 26, 2014. Annegret Dettwiler-Danspeckgruber of the Princeton Neuroscience Institute chaired the event along with the Brain Injury Alliance of New Jersey; panelists included professional Pro Football Hall of Famer Harry Carson, ESPN Magazine writer and League of Denial contributor Peter Keating, Columbia University Medical Center expert James Noble and University professor of economics Uwe E. Reinhardt. I learned a tremendous amount from this forum and am sure that all those sitting in the packed auditorium could say the same. Following the panel, I had a couple of specific thoughts about concussions in youth athletics and on our campus. The University has a tremendous opportunity to be a leader in how academic institutions handle concussion management. Different departments — academic, social and health-related — work together across many spheres of life to give University students a comprehensive and well-rounded experience. If the Office of the Dean of the College, University Health Services, the Department of Athletics, for instance, worked in a similarly integrated manner to create a modernized support system for concussion management, it would greatly benefit students both athletically and academically by coordinating their recovery in a way that reduces stress, keeps academic work at a pace that is sustainable for an injured athlete, gets athletes back into competition in a safe and efficient way, and allows students then to return to their full capacity to all of their activities. Additionally, the University will be admired by its peers for taking such a proactive stance on this critical issue. While individual professors do work with concussed students to make individual arrangements to ease the academic workload, it would be essential to establish a more formal process at the University to allow concussed students to spread out their workload and exams so that they have other options aside from taking a full-year leave from school. The University does have policies to allow for extensions for papers in the case of head injuries, but there is room for more progress to be made in terms of accommodating injured student-athletes. One measure that the University could take would be to allow concussed students to reschedule exams for a later date, once their symptoms have subsided, so that they do not have to take a full-year leave from school. The University’s willingness to host the discussion was a positive step toward spreading concussion awareness management. A great next step would be to create concussion management policies, with the help of experts such as the panelists, to enable the University to take the lead in giving students the support they need. Handling concussions is one problem, but another is preventing them by altering the culture in youth sports. Every adult in a youth athlete’s life plays a role in his or her protection from concussions. Every person involved in youth athletics — parents, researchers, coaches, clinicians, educators, athletic trainers, athletic directors, doctors and referees — is responsible for ensuring that young athletes in the present and future are protected. It takes a total team effort to ensure that kids are properly educated, diagnosed and rehabilitated in the proper manner. Every adult involved in youth athletics should have a proper education and understand the risks of keeping young athletes on the field after suffering a brain injury. It should also be mentioned that it is not the players who are pushing themselves to return to play, but often the coaches and parents who push them. It therefore seems to be of great importance to ensure that coaches and parents are aware of these risks because of the critical role they play in the lives of young athletes. The Department of Athletics puts a premium on safety and concussion prevention, but this level of awareness should be consistent throughout the entire school. Lastly, there must be a better way to find concussion specialists to help with treatment. When I suffered my most recent concussion, it took me months to find local doctors who treated concussions on a consistent basis with clinics devoted specifically to managing these injuries. It turned out that the doctors who helped me finally feel normal again after four months of suffering worked for the university three minutes from my house, but I had no way of knowing this without searching for several months. Over the past couple of years, I have heard countless stories of injured young athletes, including several University students, not knowing where to go for help. Young athletes with brain injuries must see specialists to aid them in their recovery, and yet these specialists are presently too hard to identify. I propose that there be a free online database that young athletes can use to quickly look up local concussion specialists. This measure would eliminate large amounts of time during which injured young athletes unnecessarily suffer. If the University could create such a database as a resource for its students here and become part of the effort to develop a similar contact list on a broader scale, it would be providing an essential service to its student body and beyond. In addition to listening to the panelists, I also had the honor of participating in the discussion as a representative of Countywide Concussion Care and as the voice of a youth athlete who has suffered concussions. My contribution was well received by both the panelists and the audience, and it was a true honor to play a part in such an amazing event. My appreciation for this event is immense because it spread so much useful knowledge about a critical issue to which I relate personally. Hopefully more panels such as this one occur in the future at the University and more progress is made in terms of protecting young athletes from brain injuries.|~|
79158|~|Editorial: Electing Honor Committee Representatives|~|   February 19 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|The Honor Code Constitution designates as members of the Honor Committee “the presidents of the sophomore and junior classes, former sophomore and junior class presidents, a member of the freshman class to be appointed by a subcommittee comprised of four members of the Honor Committee and the Undergraduate Student Government president, and members to be appointed by a selection committee from the student body at large until the committee consists of twelve members.”  The Editorial Board believes that the practice of including current and past class presidents in the Honor Committee membership should be discontinued in favor of independent elections, held simultaneously with class council elections, for Honor Committee representatives. This system would build an Honor Committee membership better suited to the organization’s particular challenges and would enhance the student engagement on which the Honor Code depends. The qualifications of class presidents do not necessarily align with the skills required of Honor Committee members. Candidates for class president often appeal to the student body by flooding the campus with campaign posters, or by leaving candies at dorm room doors. The Board believes that the social focus of class president elections is not the most appropriate way to choose members of the Honor Committee. The importance of the Honor Committee, as well as its many challenges, make it more sensible to consider candidates specifically for spots on the Committee, rather than to choose Committee members indirectly — and based on the criteria for a different job. The Board recommends the adoption of measures to guarantee candidates’ seriousness of purpose, dedication to the Honor Code, and qualification: candidates should (1) be required to attend multiple information sessions on the Honor Code and its enforcement before being eligible for election, and (2) be allowed to advertise their candidacy to the student body solely through basic biographical information and short personal statements. The Young Alumni Trustee election, which involve similar regulations, provide a good model for Honor Committee elections to follow. Not only would such a structure give students a say in who should represent them on the Committee, but it would produce a group of candidates focused first and foremost on the Honor Committee, rather than on the role of class president. The Honor Code is a central part of academic life at Princeton, one which students should feel they have a stake in upholding. It was students who established the Honor Code in the late 19th century, and it is students who have respected, enforced, amended and introduced new Princetonians to the Code ever since. Holding independent elections of Honor Committee representatives would go a long way toward ensuring that students remain invested in the Code’s protection and trust that the Committee and Code are responsive to their collective values and priorities. This has been a challenge in recent years; a number of opinion pieces in The Daily Princetonian have illustrated a growing feeling of estrangement on the part of the undergraduate student body. In May of last year, the ‘Prince’ reported on concerns over Honor Committee transparency, and in September the Board called for a review of Committee practices to be made available to the student community. Elections focused specifically on the Honor Committee would increase student confidence in the Honor Code system. The Honor Committee is important enough to academic life at Princeton to be the subject of independent elections. Conflating Honor Committee appointments with class president campaigns not only compromises the focus of the Committee’s membership, but decreases the direct involvement of the student body in preserving the Honor Code. Honor Committee members should be selected by students based on the requirements of the Honor Committee alone.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief.

79162|~|Letter to the editor concerning Willie Parker|~|   February 19 2015|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Zach Horton ’15 The Daily Princetonian coverage of abortionist Willie Parker’s Wednesday lecture reads like a transcript of Parker’s remarks. It failed to give a balanced account of the extremely controversial event. Unmentioned were the more than 35 pro-life students and faculty present and respectful throughout the event.  Unmentioned was Parker’s disparaging of pro-life activists and avoidance of tough questions. Notably, the ‘Prince’ misquoted my question to Parker and failed to report his response in full. I urged Parker to show empathy and suppose for a moment that he believed, as I and many others do, that abortion is tantamount to murder — the deliberate ending of innocent human life. I asked, “How would you act?  Would you regard that belief as a private moral opinion and do nothing?” Parker avoided the force of the question, only eventually responding that he would simply have to give up his day job. His answer, however, was damning. Only refusing to commit genocide is not to fight genocide. Likewise, simply refraining from performing abortions is not to fight abortion. To my second question, then, Parker implicitly answered “yes.” This indicates his gross unwillingness to recognize the moral gravity of abortion, and it betrays his absolute refusal even to attempt to understand why we, the members of the pro-life movement, do what we do to fight it. Most deplorable, however, was Parker’s perverse use of civil rights language to promote abortion — the biggest civil rights crisis of our day. Abortion is the widespread discrimination against — and commonplace extermination of — a class of human beings: namely, those still in the womb. There is even more pronounced discrimination against developing human beings with medical conditions (especially Down’s Syndrome) and those of a culturally-unfavored sex (notably women in China and India). It is appalling that this discrimination and total degradation of the dignity of human life would be defended with civil rights rhetoric and the very words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Respectfully, Zach Horton ’15|~|Editor’s note: Zach Horton is also a member of The Daily Princetonian Editorial Board, but is writing this letter in his capacity as a member of Princeton Pro-Life who was quoted in a Feb. 19 article, “Well-being of patients most important in abortion cases, Parker argues.” 
78949|~|More on sexual misconduct|~|   February 18 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Matthew Choi Taitano|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|With the recent events surrounding the “Princeton Mom” and Tiger Inn, sexual misconduct has been talked about significantly both on campus and in the pages of The Daily Princetonian. The issue, however, is not only confined to our campus. As discussed in a recent article by fellow columnist Marni Morse, who addresses cases at other colleges, this is clearly a national problem. In light of all this, it may be tempting to feel that the topic has been sufficiently addressed. Yet, this coverage, while undoubtedly raising awareness for some, still maintains an environment that discourages others to talk. Although women are often depicted as the victims of these crimes, men can also be victims of sexual misconduct. Granted, this isn’t a revolutionary claim, and I am sure many are aware that it happens. But it may be easy to lose scope of the problem. Based on the National Crime Victimization Survey, published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, college-aged males make up 17% of all rape and sexual assault victimizations. Despite this, cases of sexual misconduct against men appear to be treated less seriously than those against women. This issue seems to be ignored because of both our cultural perception of men and the reinforcement of that perception by the media. As Steve LaPore, founder and director of 1in6, an organization that supports male victims of sexual misconduct, claims, “Culturally we still don’t want to see men as vulnerable. We tell little boys and men to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.” This stigma of self-preservation and masculinity placed upon men creates an environment in which they are almost discouraged to share their stories. A recent article in the Huffington Post detailed how a student at Brown was sexually assaulted his freshman year. When he initially told his friends, he simply joked that it was a “5 a.m. hookup in the bathroom.” Eventually, he mustered the courage to file a formal complaint to his university and his assailant was successfully expelled. However, the assailant was only expelled because this was the third reported case against him. Brown had let the student off with only a one-semester suspension before. These situations are further downplayed by the media. Instead of helping remove the stigma around sexual misconduct against men, the media has only helped to reinforce the perception that men don’t need help. For instance, in February 2014, actor Shia LaBeouf shared his story about being raped during his art showcase, #IAMSORRY. However, his story did not lead to an investigation or a serious talk about how men could be victims as well. Rather, people on social media downplayed the situation, even to the extent of making fun of him. CNN’s Piers Morgan called the story “truly pathetic.” Yet, LaBeouf and the student from Brown are not exceptions to the norm. Their stories are not only theirs, but also the stories of hundreds of other men. Their experiences are just as valid as that of any other victim and should be treated that way. Unfortunately, this problem is especially ignored in the case of queer men, who already endure stigmatization merely for their sexual orientation. As stated in the Huffington Post article, Clayton Bullock, psychiatrist and co-author of “Male Victims of Sexual Assault: Phenomenology, Psychology, Physiology,” said: “Gay men are often targets of sexual assault because of gay-bashing, or because of conflicted feelings about the assailant’s own attraction to other men in which they are ‘exorcising their internalized homophobia.’ ” Additionally, Bullock raised the concern that perceptions of gay men as promiscuous only make it even more likely that others will downplay the problem, instead of seeking proper help and attention. To create an environment in which victims of sexual misconduct feel safe in sharing their stories, we as a community must open up to listening to their stories sans biases not only of gender and sexuality, but also of other factors such as race, socio-economic status or religion. However, we are not all-knowing and should not feel that way. Handling any case of sexual assault is an overwhelming task and can be an unexpected one. In our pursuit to create a better environment for victims, we should not feel pressured to know all the answers about how to help them. But it is very important that we make sure that they get the right kind of help, even if we are not the one providing it directly. That being said, sometimes it may be more helpful to just simply provide a listening ear beforehand. In the end, the most important thing we can do is to make sure victims feel like they have an outlet through which they can share their stories and seek help if they choose to do so. Having to endure the trauma of sexual misconduct is painful, especially when one has to go through it alone. Hopefully, we as a community will be able to improve the ways in which we deal with situations of sexual misconduct by creating an open, unbiased environment in which victims can share their stories.|~|Matthew Choi Taitano is a freshman from Yigo, Guam.

78951|~|Let's talk to strangers|~|   February 18 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|At the start of this academic year, I wrote a column advising freshmen to give themselves more than a couple months to decide how they felt about Princeton and the college experience. I told them how I had started my Princeton career as an awfully unhappy freshman but have since fallen in love with this university. In that column I told my story in the hope that freshmen might save themselves the same self-doubt and anxiety that plagued my first semester of Princeton. A few months later I was contacted by a freshman girl who had read my article and found herself caught in the same dispirited trap I had described. We met for lunch and I poured upon her all the advice I wish I could have given myself four years ago. We have since kept in touch — updates here and there, passes given, plans made for lunch. But I had largely forgotten my article as the impetus for our relationship until this past week, when I received an email from a second freshman girl. She, too, had connected with the sad beginnings of my ultimately happy story. We met for coffee and I did my best to quell some of her concerns. Both girls now have my number and I theirs. I have told them — implored them — to let me know if they ever need anything. I care about these two girls. But, more importantly, I have the utmost respect for these two girls. Emailing a stranger — and an upperclassman at that — is no small feat, particularly when it is for no other reason than to talk. The campus culture at Princeton seems predicated on modes of divisions between cliques, teams, eating clubs or class year and it is not often that these barriers are breached in the hopes of creating new relationships. For any student to reach out to another with whom they have no tangible association is largely against the norm. As you move from freshman to senior year, students you simply had yet to meet slowly become strangers whom you will most likely never meet. Paradoxically, however, there seems to be a pervasive desire to extend beyond one’s usual social group in search of new connections. On Monday, The Daily Princetonian reported that a student-organized group known as Tea with Strangers — a program that invites six students who are otherwise unacquainted to come together for conversation over tea — was filled to capacity within three hours of its launch, with at least fifty more students on the waitlist. Last year’s iteration, called Let’s Get Coffee, boasted over 200 participants with an insupportable waitlist as well. And these two are only the latest in a series of programs designed to bring “strangers” together. In early 2012, PrincetonLunch worked to facilitate one-on-one platonic meetings between users. Meanwhile, Princeton Muse and Club Nom encourage larger group interactions over the discussion of thought-provoking questions. The overwhelming support for these groups demonstrates a clear demand for avenues by which to meet new people and form productive, meaningful relationships. But why must we wait for structured organizations to facilitate these introductions? Are we truly so inept at reaching out to other students that we need someone else to offer a space, time and warm caffeinated beverage to do so? My intention is not criticize these groups. On the contrary, I am thrilled to see student organizations taking steps to fill this void. However, I want these groups to be a supplement, not a replacement, for action on an individual level. It is possible, if not more powerful, to develop one-on-one support networks and relationships without a structured program. Through a column I thought would be read by few and touch even fewer, two girls saw someone removed enough from their lives to be objective, yet close enough to understand. They took the personal initiative to reach out and I know I am the better for it, and truly hope they can say the same. Now, I encourage others to follow suit. Upperclassmen, in particular, can offer an excellent support system for unaffiliated underclassmen in this way. The next step is to make these modes of communication become more pervasive and commonplace. It should not be surprising for a freshman to reach out in hopes of speaking with an objective third party and forming a relationship that might broaden or enlighten both students’ Princeton experience. While I had the good fortune of meeting these two girls through my column, there are multiple avenues that could be taken to form such relationships. Perhaps the lead in a show strikes you with his performance. Perhaps the junior in your precept says something brilliantly confounding. Perhaps the same girl bakes you cookies in Murray Dodge every week and you’d like to say something, anything. These may sound like odd, if not awkward, beginnings to meaningful conversations. Yet if it becomes commonplace to speak with the people that have touched you or moved you, regardless of your connection to them, then we can create a far more interconnected, inspired social culture. If we begin talking to strangers, this whole experience might be a little less strange for the lot of us.|~|Chelsea Jones is an English major from Ridgefield, Conn.

78916|~|The new sheriff in town: on vigilante justice|~|   February 18 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|I’ve been following Anonymous — a loosely connected group of internet hackers — for a few months now. I first heard about them this past November when they infamously launched a cyber-attack on the Ku Klux Klan, hacking its websites and Twitter accounts and releasing personal information about its members. At its best, the actions of Anonymous constitute a muddled attempt at bullying an equally unfriendly group through annoying cyber harassment. At its worst, this event was a deliberate and coordinated attack against civil liberties and the right to free speech. A quick browse of Anonymous’s Facebook page reveals a hodgepodge of images and posts supporting a wide variety of issues with very little in common save a serious mistrust of authority or organizational structure. It reads more like a desperate call to anarchy than a coherent message or value system. Of course, the KKK hack was not a standalone incident. Past targets of Anonymous in the past have varied widely, including the U.S. government, corporations such as Sony and Visa and religious groups like the Church of Scientology. Their recent campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, however, is a different story entirely. Following the attacks on Charlie Hebdo last month, a Belgian branch of Anonymous released a chilling video on their YouTube account declaring war on the “terrorists.” Sporting the distinctive Guy Fawkes mask, a lone individual states in a menacingly distorted voice that Anonymous “will track you down to the last one and will kill you.” Frightening messages like this one make it difficult to determine who the real terrorists are in the first place. Moral equivalencies aside, this is no way for societies to police themselves or other societies. A select, ungoverned few should never hold the power to decide right from wrong or to carry out due punishment. As much as our culture values superheroes and vigilantism in Hollywood, Batman does not and should never exist. Such a force has the potential for serious consequences. It’s easy to imagine multiple scenarios by which this campaign, or any of Anonymous’s campaigns for that matter, can go disastrously wrong. A key aspect of this loosely connected network of computer hackers is the unstructured, disjointed nature of their organization. While the group clearly consists of many intelligent and talented individuals, oversight is nonexistent, and the group is held together by nothing more than an unclear and tenuous motive. This is a precariously dangerous organizational structure given the capabilities that Anonymous has demonstrated in the past.  The potential consequences are numerous. For one, this is the perfect stage for extremists to latch onto these intentionally ambiguous and unguided motives to justify their malicious and hateful cyber-attacks on innocent people. Anonymous has created a flaming echo chamber for anarchistic, anti-religious sentiments among people with the skills to act on these beliefs. I doubt most Anonymous hackers are so unhinged. They are, however, human, subject to the very same emotional biases that organized justice is meant to protect against. Their video declaring war on ISIS has clear undertones of anger and vengeance. Blinded by anger from witnessing the loss of innocent lives, it becomes disturbingly easy to allow emotions to clout judgment and turn attacks against innocent bystanders. This form of vigilante justice is only a few steps away from indiscriminately attacking innocent Muslims in blind rage for the heinous actions taken by a select minority. Lacking any formal rules or oversight, there is little to stop this powerful organization from trampling over the lives of innocent people. Assuming these completely unknown individuals possess the mental fortitude to act as unbiased judges, by what standards do they judge guilt? What criterion decides the fate of those who have come into the crosshairs of this untamed and formidable arbitrator? Surely, Anonymous only takes action against those judged to be unequivocally guilty. Determining guilt, however, is never that simple. This is precisely why we have a justice system so heavily predicated on the paradigm “innocent until proven guilty.” A slight oversight, an overzealous hacker and suddenly an innocent man has been identified as a member of the KKK or ISIS, his life now undeniably in peril. Most of Anonymous’s targets are a far cry from murderous extremist groups and deserve due course and protection from the law. However, no group, not even ISIS, necessitates the existence of ungoverned vigilantism. Certainly, defense of the vile actions of ISIS or its affiliated groups is not the proper side to take in any debate. Sickening as their actions have been, we cannot allow anger and fear to give rise to lynch-mob-style justice. Wanting justice and retribution is innately human, but long have humans recognized that these emotions are counterproductive to determining truth and achieving fair justice. As unsatisfying as it can be to watch President Obama meander around the issues as thousands are murdered in the Middle East, or to watch the KKK spew bigotry and hatred, or see criminals slip through the widening cracks of our convoluted justice system, it is important to remember that justice is an intentionally stagnant process. Too often we forget that laws and regulations exist to protect us as much as they do to punish wrongdoing. Anonymous, as well-intentioned and talented as it is, spits in the face of this principle.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a computer science major from Pittsburgh, Pa.

78760|~|Diversity and some inevitable trade-offs|~|   February 17 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|To begin with the obvious: diversity is hardly a new topic of conversation at the University. Since 1963, when women first enrolled in the University’s Critical Language Program, a selective grant-funded program, there have been arguments about the forced inclusion of marginalized groups. However, since the strong student activism on campus in the wake of the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases, the conversation about diversity has taken on a greater sense of urgency. The post-Ferguson conversation on diversity has continued over the past months in the form of more panels, in the Special Task Force on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion created in December, on Facebook, in opinion columns and in public campaigns. However, widely agreed-upon goals concerning diversity remain elusive. First we need to ask ourselves: what exactly is the purpose of diversity? It may simply be a moral ideal, a condition of inclusivity and fairness for all high-achieving individuals. Or it may also be a condition for strengthening the academic community and furthering the University’s traditional goals — producing the best scholarly research and providing the best education possible. Is it possible to achieve both of these conditions? Both of these causes have been cited from various political perspectives. This was on display a panel held in December, as James Madison Program senior preceptor Russell Nieli GS ’79 put forth a tone-deaf case for neoconservative “strict meritocracy” and University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 defended University admissions policies. More recently, associate opinion editor emerita for The Daily Princetonian  Tehila Wenger and ‘Prince’ columnist Erica Choi have written about faculty diversity, and ‘Prince’ columnist Newby Parton has criticized affirmative action on the basis of race in the University’s admissions. Yet no one seems willing to acknowledge that which continues to make diversity such a controversial topic — the unresolvable tension between individual merit and community vitality. Diversity undeniably improves the academic community as a whole by ensuring that education and research be conducted from a variety of different perspectives. Affirmative action is clearly necessary to achieve meaningful diversity. To a certain extent, affirmative action can also lead to better recognition of individual merit. Still, it is impossible for an institution to both achieve a truly diverse community and to deal with each individual in a completely fair manner based strictly on merit. To do so, the University would have to establish rigid criteria both for admissions and faculty hires based solely on merit rather than background — a process that is not only impossible but that would severely limit the University’s ability to create a vital, academically strong community. Ultimately, the ideas of a “meritocratic” institution, founded on individual worth and a “representative” institution, founded on collective worth, are both impossible. The best that any organization can hope for is to reach the best possible balance, while acknowledging that a value judgment favoring one or the other in each specific case will always be necessary. A true meritocracy cannot exist because there is no way to completely separate an individual’s performance from his background. Especially in admissions, there is no criteria to objectively gauge an applicant’s potential as a member of the Princeton community. In his column “Princeton Admissions and its Racism,” Parton argues that, because the population of Asian-Americans has grown but their representation in elite universities has stagnated or fallen, affirmative action has served as discrimination against this group. However, he ignores the point that Rod M. Bugarin makes (in the same debate cited in Parton’s column) about admissions criteria — namely, that the standardized testing component has benefited Asian-American students. Where Parton sees a quota in place is more likely a shift away from emphasizing standardized testing. So while it is clear that individual merit alone is difficult to judge, much less use as the sole foundation of an institution, the idea of “representation” is similarly shaky. We can tell when something is wrong — for example, the fact that this year 8.3 percent of the undergraduates are Latino or Hispanic in a country where, in 2013, 17.1% of citizens were Latino or Hispanic (even higher in New Jersey) clearly indicates a problem. But how do we know when we’ve hit the right balance, and should that be representative of our country’s demographics, when 11.3% of undergraduates are international students? Should the University try to represent the world’s population, with its massive racial and economic diversity (to name only a couple types of diversity)? Evidence suggests that even in Ph.D. programs, with better-defined criteria based not on high school clubs but on years of education and research, women and minorities may be significantly disadvantaged. Still, emphasis on affirmative action in hiring faculty inevitably decreases the University’s flexibility to hire the leaders in a given field based on particular, often specialized research or teaching interests. Diversity is proven to make organizations more effective, and it best enables an institution like the University to explore pressing cultural, historical and scientific questions through research and in the classroom. However, affirmative action cannot be fair on an individual basis — it inevitably limits the University’s ability to balance individual achievement and background. There is an inevitable trade-off between valuing individual merit and fairness and the vitality of the community. We may emphasize one over the other, but we must acknowledge that this is ultimately a value judgment.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I. He can be reached at mgrear@princeton.edu. 
78757|~|Ivy League elitism, revisited|~|   February 17 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Last week, guest columnist Theo Furchtgott (full disclosure: Furchtgott is a friend and fellow Governing Council member of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society) decried the “steep price” we Ivy Leaguers pay when seeking public office, since our top-ranked degrees are liable to come back and bite us in populist, anti-intellectual attack ads. While I agree with his assertion that receiving a rigorous education should not be seen as a bad thing, I think Furchtgott’s premise misidentifies the true root of this problem of perception. In my opinion, the reason for such bitterness against candidates with Ivy League degrees isn’t motivated by some vague jealousy or insecurity about one’s own intellect or education, but rather by the justly-perceived inaccessibility of these institutions. Pointing out that Ivy-Leaguers make up close to 19 percent of the 114th Congress but only 0.4 percent of all American undergraduates — as Furchtgott is right to do — in fact confirms the very argument he is trying to rebut. While attack ads, such as those launched by Karl Rove against Elizabeth Warren, often indict a candidate as a professor or an Ivy League, out-of-touch snob, they often prove ineffective, at least in Congressional elections. We shouldn’t hate a candidate for being smart; in fact, we should value intellect as a necessary facet of bold leadership. But that’s not what I think most people are actually attacking, even though it is what the attack ads might be. The real issue for most people is not a fear of others whom they believe to be smarter than themselves, on account of credentials like Ivy League degrees, but rather a fear of entrenching a system of asymmetrical access to top-quality education. That is to say, that for most people who buy into the distorted rhetoric of such ads, they do so not because they inherently see intellect as a bad thing, but because the term ‘Ivy League’ conjures up images of castles, of playgrounds for the elite and of an inaccessible education. There’s a reason the same charges aren’t made against candidates who went to, say, the University of California, Berkeley or Georgetown, even though these and other schools also provide a top-notch education. As Noliwe Rooks, associate professor of Africana and feminist, gender and sexuality studies at Cornell, wrote in Time in 2013, the “biggest barrier to elite education” is the way in which elite universities — epitomized by the Ancient Eight — reinforce cycles of privilege in their admissions methodologies. While factors such as performance on standardized test scores — which has actually been found to be more strongly correlated with parents’ income than any other metric — affect underprivileged applicants to almost all four-year universities, the Ivy League in particular is also affected by reliance on legacy admissions. Whereas many public university systems — including the nation’s largest public university system, the University of California — have done away with legacy admissions, at the University, the legacy acceptance rate is close to four times higher than the general rate. This, coupled with a lack of economic diversity highlighted recently by the Princeton Hidden Minority Council’s photo campaign, leads to more than just an image problem for hallowed institutions like ours; the problem of access is also a delegitimizing force to the electorate. Graduates of Ivy League schools are seen to have been admitted based on what boarding school they attended or what building is named after their ancestor, rather than on actual talent or merit. This is a huge problem in its own right, too big to do justice to here, but it is worth bringing up in the context of discussing the “Ivy League attack ad” problem in national politics. In the case of reversing the negative connotation associated with the Ivy League and turning it into a political plus, if we want to do better, we have to be better. The only way to fix the political or image problem that the Ivy League name carries with it is to truly be meritocratic, and open our doors to talent from all backgrounds. This is an initiative that should be applauded. However, the image problem of Ivy League elitism — as opposed to elitism in other forms — will never fully go away until we completely fix the substantive problem behind it.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

78590|~|The Chapel Hill Murders and Mainstream Media|~|   February 17 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By: Ismael Catovic Last Wednesday, I awoke to the tragic news of the murder of three college-age Muslim Americans in Chapel Hill, N.C.. Deah Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister, Razan Abu-Salha, 19, were murdered execution-style in their condominium two miles from the UNC campus. One week later, I’m finding it difficult to convince myself that the reason for the brutal murders was — as reported by several news outlets — a dispute about parking spaces with their neighbor and killer, 46-year-old Craig Hicks. Currently, a federal investigation is underway, along with an ongoing investigation by the Chapel Hill Police Department, to determine the true motive of the killings many believe was a hate crime. I saw the news on Al Jazeera on Wednesday morning, but it was only when I attended a vigil that afternoon honoring the victims did I realize that so many students on campus had not heard about the case. Most students who did know had learned about the shootings through social media. Specifically, the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter was trending on twitter with over 100,000 tweets on Wednesday, a reference to the perceived lack of coverage in the mainstream media. In the late afternoon and evening, mainstream news stations began to air the story more regularly. In the past week, Deah Barakat’s older sister Suzanne Barakat has appeared in many interviews advocating for her family and community and honoring the legacy of her loved ones by reminding us all about the dangers of bigotry and hatred. She referenced a tweet made last Tuesday by California assemblywoman Melissa Melendez that used the hashtag #standupagainstIslam. While councilwoman Melendez later explained that the tweet was not directed at “peaceful Muslims”, the message conveyed by the tweet was clear and disturbing. The equating of Islam and its followers, Muslims, with ISIS or other extremist groups is troubling and needs to end. Muslims across the world have condemned all manifestations of extremism and explained that these radical displays are entirely un-Islamic, yet many still see Islam, rather than extremism, as the enemy that needs to be stopped. This type of hateful rhetoric is frightening because it creates a hostile environment which can lead to alienation, fear, distrust, discrimination, and even death. Part of the feeling of distrust comes from a perceived double standard — which columnist for The Daily Princetonian Zeena Mubarak mentioned in her column — in the rhetoric used by the mainstream media when referring to Muslims. In one interview with CNN, Suzanne says to this effect, “Had roles been reversed and the man was Muslim, was of Arab descent, was of South-Asian descent, this would have immediately been labeled an act of terror. I haven’t heard anyone use the term terrorist here … why the double standard?” She goes on to describe how her family, their lives, and their local, national and international community were terrorized by Hicks’s actions. Her statements reflect what I believe to be the sentiments of a significant segment of the Muslim American population. Are her claims justified? Is there a double standard when it comes to Muslims being portrayed in the media, and if so, what is its purpose? I do not believe that the answers to these questions will be completely definitive, generally applicable, or all-encompassing. Although I do not have detailed quantitative information cataloging the media coverage of events concerning Muslims, I do believe that there is a consistent inflation of violent acts of Muslims and a downplaying of similar actions by those of different or of no faith in the media. This can be seen by the way the term terrorist/terrorism is used when referencing certain events. Take the foiled Valentine’s Day attack in Canada last week. To start, how often did you hear of it or see it in the news? Beyond the frequency and placement of the story in the media, the way that it was described is also noteworthy. The Canadian Justice Minister said, “The attack does not appear to have been culturally motivated, therefore not linked to terrorism.” Although Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath and Randall Steven Shepherd plotted to kill massive amounts of people at the Halifax shopping center, their actions were not considered acts of terror because there was no alleged cultural motivation. The writing on the wall is clear: although Lindsay and Randall plotted to kill many random innocent people, they were not Muslim, so this was not an act of terror. It is because of stories like this one that many Muslim Americans feel that a double standard and subpar recognition by the mainstream media is too common regarding news stories that involve Muslims. One of the more disturbing news segments I witnessed about the shootings aired on CBS’s “Inside Edition” which used the murder of the three innocent Americans to segue into a segment called “Breaking the Code” about tips to ease the “frustrating” process of finding a parking spot, a reference to the alleged motive of the murderer. The insensitivity displayed by the segment was truly disheartening — it was as though CBS was making light of the murders of three young Americans and validating the actions of the murderer. Despite the media coverage, outpouring support from tens of thousands of Americans gives hope that unity, trust, and community in spite of diversity are achievable. In fact, this reality exhibited by millions of Americans daily is exactly what Yusor cherished about her home country. “Growing up in America has been such a blessing … It doesn’t matter where you come from. There’s so many different people from so many different places, of different backgrounds and religions — but here, we’re all one.” Rest in Peace Deah, Yusor, and Razan.

78588|~|Princeton admissions and its racism|~|   February 16 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|Harvard, Yale and Princeton had been educating America’s elite for 200 years when, in the 1920s, the Big Three began to have a problem: Jews. The problem was especially dire at Harvard, where Jews — nationally, 3 percent of the population — made up 27 percent of the student body by 1925. Harvard’s president Abbott Lowell feared that high Jewish enrollment would prompt the social elite to send their children elsewhere, so he proposed a quota. No more than 15 percent of each class would be Jewish. Lowell’s proposal proved controversial, so it was never officially adopted. Instead, Harvard developed an admission system based on character — what we call “holistic admissions” today. Lowell assured skeptics that this system would not discriminate against Jews, but the next admissions cycle saw Jewish enrollment cut in half. For decades, their enrollment stayed steady at 15 percent — right where Lowell wanted the quota. Yale and Princeton had their own ways of treating the problem. Yale adopted legacy preference to keep whites in and Jews out. Not to be bested, our own Princeton University slashed its Jewish enrollment to 2 percent. This tale of anti-Semitism must seem shameful to modern readers. We recognize prejudice was a sin of the times — a decades-long blot in the annals of Ivy League history. Thankfully, we’re writing a new chapter. Today Princeton and its peers accept students on merit, and racial quotas are relics of darker days. Except, not really. Now we have a quota on Asians. We don’t advertise it. Like the bygone quota on Jews, we pretend it does not exist. We say that our admissions process is holistic; if a whiz kid is turned away, it’s because she lacked a je ne sais quoi that another applicant possessed. That’s not the story the data tells, says Ron Unz in The New York Times. He notes that America’s college-age Asian population doubled in the last 20 years. Enrollment should have grown too, Unz said, and at the California Institute of Technology — which “follows a highly selective but strictly race-neutral admissions policy” — that’s exactly what happened: Asian enrollment grew to about 40 percent. But only 21 percent of students in Princeton’s Class of 2018 are Asian Americans, a fraction that is remarkably consistent across the Ivy League. Harvard and Yale both report that 20 percent of students in their freshman classes are Asian Americans — the same as they reported 20 years ago, before the group’s population doubled. That looks a lot like a quota. That looks exactly like a quota. That looks so much like a quota that the only defense for it is “holistic admissions,” which is the reason a former president of Harvard gave to defend a racial quota. Not long ago, I told myself that the quota was O.K. Choosing a class was a juggling act in a show called diversity, and Princeton’s admissions office managed it the best way it could. My acceptance, however, was tantamount to saying this: “I am fine with the knowledge that Princeton University is oppressing a minority by refusing them admission on the grounds of racial discrimination.” Can you say that? I can’t. I am calling on the University to abolish its racial quotas. Holistic admissions can stay, but it should not be a farce for racism. We should follow Caltech in adopting race-neutral admissions. Divorce applications from names. Hide the race checkbox. The University should still strive for diversity. We can give affirmative action to underprivileged applicants by considering their socioeconomic standing. Current admission criteria strongly favor the wealthy elite, who can afford SAT tutors, extracurricular activities, and paid college counselors, all of which are inaccessible to low-income students. This creates a serious barrier to acceptance. That’s why only 18 percent of Princeton students receive Pell Grants. Compare this to the rest of America, where 38 percent of college students are Pell Grant recipients, and it’s clear that we’re failing the very students who need an education the most — many of them from underserved black and Hispanic communities. My proposal is not perfect. College admissions is a zero-sum game, so a victory for an oppressed minority is a loss for other groups. My own progeny might be among the losers, but that’s O.K. I don’t want them to benefit from a system predicated on racism. Instead, I want the University to give up the bigotry that has plagued it for 100 years. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 called for an end to race-based discrimination 50 years ago. But a December panel on diversity faced sharp student criticism when Russell Nieli GS ’79 argued for race-neutral admissions, which shows that attitudes inside FitzRandolph Gate are not post-racial. Discrimination still thrives here. Its victims just have a new face.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn. He can be reached at newby@princeton.edu. 
78594|~|Why we need to talk about the Chapel Hill Shooting|~|   February 16 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|Last Tuesday, a gunman entered a private residence and shot and killed three students of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their names were Deah Barakat, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three of the victims were Muslims, the two girls visibly so, because they chose to wear hijab, the traditional Muslim head covering. The religion of the victims is important to note, because it explains the comparative lack of coverage of their deaths. It is also being speculated that the killer’s motive was hatred for Islam, and that these murders were in fact a hate crime. The killer, Craig Stephen Hicks, posted several long anti-religious posts on his Facebook before the attacks, including many emphasizing the role he felt Islam played in the 9/11 attacks. With these facts in mind, it is not unreasonable to think that the victims’ religion may have played a role in their murder. Right now, the police are investigating the possibility that a parking lot dispute led to the attacks. It is hard to believe that this could be all there is to it; the victims were shot execution-style within their own home. However, even if we accept, for argument’s sake, that the trigger for the attack was a parking lot dispute, we still have to ask the important question of what made Hicks feel as though he could kill three people over such a dispute. Actions don’t exist in a cultural vacuum. We live in a world where a hashtag like #KillAllMuslims can exist in a mainstream forum and be an accepted part of the general discourse. We live in a world where a president can be insulted by being accused of being Muslim. We live in a world where a movie like American Sniper, which glorifies the killing of Muslims, can break box office records. All of these facts mean something. Muslims are seen as outsiders, and dangerous ones at that. If you are socialized into believing all Muslims are inherently violent, then it becomes very easy to just pick up a gun and shoot one. But why am I writing this here, in the pages of The Daily Princetonian? I want to start a campus conversation about this. I see the memories of these victims slowly sliding away, and, as a Muslim, that terrifies me. It isn’t usually productive to think in hypotheticals, but I can’t help but wonder what the reaction would have been had the situation been reversed: had the gunman been Muslim and the victims not. I believe their pictures would have been plastered all over every news outlet, international, national and local. The victims’ names would have been on everyone’s tongues. The words “parking lot dispute” would certainly not have been brought up in conjunction with the killer — only the Muslim affiliation. But because this situation doesn’t fit neatly into the media’s preferred stereotypes, Barakat and the Abu-Salha sisters are being slowly erased. I want you, the average Princeton student, to be thinking about them and talking about them. I want you to imagine what it would be like to have a man who hates you based on your identity come into your home and press a gun to your forehead. I want you to think about the agony your parents, siblings and loved ones would go through when they heard the news. I want you to get mad. Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha was 19 when she died. She had a bright future ahead of her, and it was ripped from her hands. I want you to feel the injustice of that tragedy burn in your soul. It is absolutely imperative that we mourn our fellow American college students. Because the same attitude that is making it so easy to forget them is likely the same attitude that caused their deaths in the first place: the lack of value placed on Muslim lives.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va.

78643|~|We’re not ready for mandatory reporting|~|   February 16 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|If all the recent coverage about sexual assault on college campuses has done anything, it has encouraged people to scrutinize more closely the prevalence of sexual assault and the difficulty of bringing justice as well as to brainstorm potential solutions. The very public cases at Columbia University, Dartmouth College, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Virginia, as well as the federal Office of Civil Rights mandated policy changes at a number of institutions, have ignited policymakers and university administrators to finally begin to take action. After a Rolling Stone article was published detailing an alleged gang rape at UVA, even after numerous contradictions in that story were discovered, many members of the Virginia legislature were quick to take action. A Virginia senate subcommittee in January approved a bill requiring that sexual assault on college campuses in the state be reported to the police within 24 hours of learning of the incident. However, in their haste to find a solution to a problem long neglected, these policymakers have overlooked the possibility that such requirements for reporting to the police might harm the very victims they are trying to help. Granted, it is no surprise that legislatures are interested in taking action. The data is clear. Just between 2011 to 2013, reports of forcible sex offenses on U.S. campuses went up from 3,443 to 5,054, a 47 percent increase in two years. Sexual assault on college campuses is far too prevalent and universities are not doing enough to prevent it or bring about justice for victims. To be fair, universities are generally getting better at pursuing cases. Perhaps this is due to new mandates by the OCR or simply because of a growing understanding throughout society that reporting a low number of sexual assault cases depicts a university as being too slow to respond rather than as a sign that sexual assault isn’t a problem at said college. However, schools are still failing when it comes to handling the indictments and carrying out justice. Colleges are not required to report the outcomes of reported alleged sexual assault cases, making it hard to determine the scope of the problem. The best data we have is from a voluntary Department of Justice surveys with 120 universities in 2012 and 2013. According to the survey, there were a total of 759 reported cases of alleged sexual assault. Of those cases, universities imposed sanctions in 478 incidences, with 63 reprimands, 135 suspensions, 56 expulsions, 56 counseling, 17 community service and 151 other punishments. This federal data shows that currently “students found responsible for sexual assault are as likely to be ordered to have counseling or given a reprimand as they are to be kicked out.” This seems to confirm what we’ve heard anecdotally for years. At the UVA, zero students have been expelled for sexual misconduct in the past decade. And the Dear Harvard letter from last year shows how little that Harvard seems to be willing to do for sexual assault victims, as evidenced by the school refusing to relocate the attacker to a different dorm, instead forcing the victim to eventually move herself. If these facts show anything, it’s that schools have clearly failed at handling sexual assault cases in the past. It’s a point that advocates for both the victims and the accused can agree on (even if they don’t agree on what to do about it). But this reality does not mean that the best or even proper response is to ignore the problem and rely on the police to handle these sexual assault cases instead. Even if the victim does choose to involve the police, the university still must pursue an independent investigation and determine an outcome for an alleged violation of school policy. Police involvement does not relieve a university of this responsibility. Universities must become better equipped to deal with these cases. Moreover, the reality is that our current criminal justice system also is unable to sufficiently handle cases of sexual assault — ranging from properly understanding how to treat victims who come forward, to how to investigate in a timely and considerate manner, to how our laws define consent, there is still much that needs to be figured out. At the end of the day, until the criminal justice system is also better able to handle these cases, the choice to report these cases to the police must rest with the victim. In light of this, it would be a mistake for Virginia to treat the mandatory reporting of any case of alleged college sexual assault to the police as an end-all solution. Because people realize the limitations of the federal and state laws in handling these cases, police reporting might deter even more students to report cases to school administrators. Any chance for help and justice is removed if those who (justly) do not have confidence in the criminal justice system believe they can no longer even speak out to the college administration because of such a law. Perhaps such a law may be justified in the future. But now is not the time for this particular reform. In the short-term, we need to consider how colleges can best serve victims of sexual assault and the campus communities at large. Reforming college policies is easier than the various changes needed to improve the criminal justice system regarding sexual assault. And in the long-term, hopefully we will be able to curb rape culture and curtail the number cases of sexual assault altogether.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

78471|~|Teachers who look as they may|~|   February 15 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The Daily Princetonian recently published a column titled “Teachers who look like us,” written by Tehila Wenger. She argues in favor of professors who reflect the diversity of the student body which would provide mentorship and guidance that is more than simply academic. There are obvious benefits to a diverse faculty; a controlled experiment revealed “the level of critical analysis and alternatives was higher in groups exposed to minority viewpoints.” Puzzlingly, while Wenger cites these benefits of diversity as the reason to hire more underrepresented faculty members, she actually claims to learn best not from diverse professors, but rather from ones who look like her. She is correct in pointing out that the University’s faculty is rather homogenous. A thorough investigation of Princeton’s diversity by the Trustee Ad Hoc Committee revealed that the diversity at graduate and faculty level is far more limited than it is at the undergraduate level. According to the report, an overwhelming 85 percent of our professors are white. Asians, the next largest racial group in faculty, make up 9 percent; blacks make up 4 percent and Hispanics 2 percent. Further, 80 percent of full-time professors are male while only 20 percent are female. Princeton’s numbers reflect those of other universities in the nation. However, Wenger also needs to recognize that the University has made efforts and realized moderate successes in increasing the diversity of the faculty member. From 1980 to 2010, every race other than white saw increase in its representation of associate and full-time professors. Of course, the numbers still leave room for improvement. Specifically, the percentage of Hispanic associate and full-time professors at Princeton increased from 1 percent to 2 percent, and black associate and full-time professors from 1 to 4 percent. With gender balance, the University seems to have made greater improvements; female professors went from 3 to 22 percent. The University also has a “disciplinary ‘watch list’ to track promising scholars, especially those with the potential to be future Princeton faculty members.” One thing that needs to be realized is that the creation of a true, diverse environment is not one that will come overnight. Superfluous attempts to do so will not only expose Princeton students to faculty members who may not be as qualified, but also might hurt those minority professors by creating a societal perception that their job owes to their race and gender. The University’s focus currently is appropriately placed on providing students with the best education possible, which necessarily means that it should hire professors who are top in their fields. To increase diversity, we must look at the undergraduate level. Here, we should reward those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds who did not have the same resources available. The Orange Bubble may feel homogenous and blue-blooded, but this generation of Princetonians is more diverse than any that came before. The gender ratio is all but even and 60 percent of Princeton’s undergraduates are on financial aid. Racially, African-Americans represent 8.1 percent of the University, Asians 21.4 percent and Hispanics 9.1 percent. It is undeniable that the University has grown in diversity and will continue to grow. African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians who are current students and will grow into successful scholars under the guidance of the amazing faculty here will naturally add to diversity later on. This is genuine diversity: the nurturing of underprivileged minorities so that they can become successful and well-endowed, not the hiring of those whose primary contribution to the University will be their difference in the skin color.|~|
78448|~|Editorial: Reform Princeton’s academic calendar|~|   February 15 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Earlier this month, almost 40 percent of Princeton undergraduates voted in an Undergraduate Student Government-sponsored referendum to “call on the faculty and administration to provide for a three-week winter recess during the 2015-16 academic year and future academic years.” Predictably, it passed, with over 96 percent of students voting in favor. This highlights an important issue with the way the University determines the start and end dates of winter recess: however, it also presents an opportunity to look at possible changes to Princeton’s academic calendar as a whole. Over the past three years, the Editorial Board has repeatedly called for various changes to the academic calendar, including making Thanksgiving break a full week and moving finals before winter recess. In light of the USG referendum and long-time student complaints about the University’s academic calendar, we believe that the University should always make winter recess at least three weeks long, and we renew our call for finals to be moved before winter break. Currently, the Rules and Procedures of the Faculty of Princeton University state that Princeton’s winter recess will begin after classes end “on the Friday between December 12 and 18” and will conclude “on the Sunday between January 1 and 7.” As the University has stated, this means that variations in the Gregorian calendar will occasionally cause winter recess to be only 17 days, as has occurred for the 2015-2016 academic year. This poses several problems for students. First, students who live particularly far from campus or have more expensive travel costs are further limited in the amount of time they can spend with their families over the holidays. Second, it reduces the amount of time students have to truly get a break from classes and academic work before returning to campus for reading period and final exams. Lengthening winter recess next year and in future academic years has overwhelming support among students and would significantly benefit students, particularly those who live far from campus. Princeton’s final exams have been after winter recess since the 1939-40 academic year, but despite all of our peer institutions changing their calendars in recent decades to conduct final exams before winter break, Princeton has resisted calls to do the same. When Harvard announced in 2007 that it would move its finals before winter break, Princeton investigated whether the University should make a similar change, but this effort failed because the University did not see a consensus among students on the issue, despite problems with the survey used to gauge support for moving final exams. Moving Princeton’s final exams before winter recess would benefit students in several ways. First, it would free students from having to study or do academic work over winter recess. This would have immense benefits, including giving students time to explore other interests, work on internship and job applications, spend more time with their families, participate in winter internships or other programs, and give seniors an extended break to focus on their theses without other academic work. Second, it would eliminate the problem of students forgetting material over winter recess. Finally, it would reduce the pace of our academic calendar by giving students a solid, four-week winter recess that would combine the normal break with intercession. By not dragging out the semester from September to the middle of January, the new calendar would allow students to go home for the holidays with their semester finished and behind them. Though this change would require beginning the academic year earlier and other major changes to the structure of the calendar, any negative consequences of these changes would be outweighed by the benefits of having exams before winter break. While lengthening winter recess because of pre-recess exams might negatively affect some students, such as international students, who normally choose to remain on campus during the holidays, a longer break might make it more feasible for them to go home, and universities with as many, or more, international students across the country regularly have longer winter breaks without issue. Princeton’s academic calendar, with its incredibly late start, post-break finals and shorter winter break, has drawn student complaints for decades. Though many faculty members and others on campus might feel attached to a calendar that has been a Princeton tradition since before the Second World War, Princeton was alone among its peers after 2007 in forcing students to take finals after winter break. The shortened winter break next year exacerbates the problems inherent in the structure of the University’s calendar, but it has served as a rallying point for student calls for change. Princeton needs to change its academic calendar, and continuing to ignore the issue is a disservice to students and the entire University community.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief.

78450|~|Turning the tables on Susan Patton '77|~|   February 15 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|In what I can only interpret as a consequence of near-total obliviousness to any sort of criticism provided to her, Susan Patton ’77, in an attempt to reassert her relevancy to current discussions on romance and sex, has inserted herself yet again into the national spotlight. She recently appeared on a segment of Comedy Central’s satirical news program The Daily Show covering Las Vegas students’ advocacy for better sex education in schools. Ms. Patton, in theory, is arguing against “sex education in schools at any grade.” In practice, her words instead serve to seriously strengthen the students’ argument. Over the course of the five-and-a-half minute clip, she grossly mischaracterizes students’ attitudes (“I think students want sex. I don’t believe they want sex ed”), claims that “sex education is something that should be taught by parents to their children” even as she can’t answer pressing questions the Las Vegas students have about birth control and STDs, and exhorts children with questions about sex to “Google it” as a legitimate alternative to structured sex education. I don’t plan on spending much time in this column arguing against Ms. Patton’s viewpoints here or in any of her other interviews or columns, because I think it’s pretty much a given that many people affiliated with Princeton have spoken out against her ideas already. As a community, we saw this last week when members of the Class of 1978 penned an editorial in this newspaper speaking out against “the attitudes of the so-called ‘Princeton Mom.’ ” We also saw this in an open letter which hundreds of Princeton faculty members signed last year, siding with students in opposition to Ms. Patton’s statements of implicating survivors of sexual assault as complicit in the crime. At this point, I think that we’ve run through most of the courses of action for dealing with the negative feedback those associated with the University receive at the hands of Ms. Patton. No matter whether we as Princetonians thoroughly debunk and rip open her claims or simply ridicule what she says, Ms. Patton will still receive a platform to speak because her thoughts fit into a pre-existing narrative about Ivy Leaguers. Her words would demonstrate how out-of-touch we are as Princeton students with the world at large, locked up in our ivory tower with antiquated and harmful views on sexual assault. Her identification as “the Princeton Mom” further solidifies this image — note her use of “the” instead of a pronoun like “a,” establishing her voice as definitive. (Though Ms. Patton claims that “the media came up with” the name and that she “doesn’t speak for the University,” her Twitter handle (@ThePrincetonMom) suggests that she is very comfortable using her position as a University graduate to augment her legitimacy.) Rather than relying on (somewhat ineffective) rhetoric against Ms. Patton’s ideas, I believe that the most positive and constructive solution to the situation at hand is to show that we as a community don’t agree with her conception of sexual well-being with actions as well as with words. I am glad that so many Princeton students and alums have shown solidarity with those Ms. Patton would denigrate, intentionally or otherwise. However, at the same time we should show that we are trying to change the status quo beyond what we say. When she says that sexual assault is a “learning experience,” we should point to the work that our SHARE peers are doing. When she objects to sex education in schools, we should contrast that with the efforts of our Peer Health Advisors. Actions speak much louder than words. More than anything, we should show that the Princeton experience Ms. Patton embodies is not the Princeton experience that almost all of us try to live. It is no longer enough to verbally reject the advice she gives as not representative of the Princeton name. We must actively reject that advice as well — if we are to stand in solidarity against a model most of us believe to be retrograde and problematic, we must show that with our actions, whether by getting involved with a health organizations on campus or simply expressing support for those affected by the issues she trivializes. It’s clear that Ms. Patton does not represent the Princeton to which we members of the wider University community are so inextricably tied. If we can show publicly that we not only believe her to be wrong, but that we have well-formed ideas about what is right, we will be a stronger community for it, and we will give society at large a better idea of what we stand for.|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

78349|~|On Ivy League elitism|~|   February 12 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Theodore Furchtgott Last weekend, I had the opportunity to attend a Model UN conference at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. For those of you who have never experienced such events, they generally involve groups of college students aggressively befriending each other in the hopes of gaining support for their various resolutions. Before too long, I became known as “the Princeton guy.” I found myself bombarded with concerning comments from my peers. “Is it true that some Princeton students are normal and not very wealthy?” asked a confused-looking Duke freshman. Declared a dismissive Hispanic student from Florida International University: “I’m guessing that your delegation is mostly white males” (I was, in fact, the only delegate from Princeton who could accurately be characterized as a “white male”). I had quickly become defined by what I was, rather than who I was. Although these awkward questions were merely attempts at building a rapport, they revealed a hostility towards Ivy League institutions and their pupils. My school, rather than my arguments, had labeled me as an outsider, as if I was a representative of a different stratum of American society – automatically non-relatable to these other students’  lives. Given the fact that only about 0.4 percent of all college undergraduates go to an Ivy League school, this may be no surprise. Yet, it was remarkable how quick my MUN co-committee members were to define me based on a single characteristic – my school. It is not secret that Ivy League graduates have outsized influence in American society. Former Ivy-leaguers make up almost 20 percent of the 114th congress. This is partly because Ivy League institutions offer the perfect fundraising network for a budding politicians. Every year dozens of seniors head off to Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan with near six-figure salaries. Every friend living a comfortable life on Wall Street translates into a future potential four-figure check or fundraiser in the Hamptons. This easy access to wealth and fundraising networks comes at a steep price for those seeking public office. With the United States’ increasingly populist political environment, economic inequality is starting to a form an “us versus them” mentality, as evidenced by comments on both sides of the aisle from liberals such as Elizabeth Warren and conservatives such as Mitt Romney (who are coincidentally both Ivy League grads themselves). When thousands of college graduates nationwide are still struggling to find jobs, it is only natural that these Ivy Leaguers’ quick crossovers into the league of the rich and well-connected could spur negative images of our institutions, especially considering our country’s economic polarization. At the end of the day, regardless of their own personal background, an Ivy League grad will appear out of touch with Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck when their degree has a two hundred thousand dollar price tag. Just as I was seen as an outsider at UNC, an elite institution in its own right, Ivy League graduates seeking political office must grapple with the Ivy League’s image problem. One only has to look at the 2014 Alaska Senate election to see an Ivy League degree being used as a sign of remoteness or even a symbol of carpet bagging. The Ivy League affiliations of Republican candidates Dan Sullivan (Harvard), Mead Treadwell (Harvard and Yale), and Joe Miller (Yale) were all seen as huge liabilities, used to reinforce existing narratives about their lack of Alaskan ties. While Princeton may flaunt its low admissions rate and top-notch faculty, the American electorate does not recognize Ivy League graduates as being necessarily better informed on issues. When President Barack Obama ran for Congress in 2000, Congressman Bobby Rush slammed him as an Ivy League elitist, claiming Harvard had turned him into “an educated fool.” Rush went on to say that “Barack is a person who read about the civil-rights protests and thinks he knows all about it.” This is not only true in the working class precincts of inner-city Chicago. LA Governor Bobby Jindal, once an up-and-coming Republican politician ready for the national stage, was widely panned by the national press when he made unsubstantiated claims about yet-undiscovered no-go zones in European cities controlled by Arab immigrants. Nobody defended Jindal on the basis of his being a Rhodes scholar and Brown graduate. Instead, Jindal’s credentials were used to dismiss his argument. Clearly Jindal’s “remarks were not a mistake, but rather part of a calculated strategy,” since an Ivy Leaguer would never think such things, the thinking goes. Still, ambitious Princetonians need not despair. In the end, Sullivan was elected to the Senate, Obama ended up in the White House, and it is far too early to count Jindal out. Maybe there are limits to the influence of populism. Maybe the fundraisers hosted by your classmate in the Hamptons will generate enough money to advertise your true Mississippi roots and disdain for the Eastern elite. While we may fret about the need to restore our image, the Ivy League will be a tough political sell as long as it maintains the benefits and prestige that allow so many of its alumni to succeed. Those of us running for office would do well to remember that flaunting a degree from Princeton might have better results in a McKinsey interview than a campaign stop in rural Nebraska. In the modern political environment, a Princeton degree has both advantages and disadvantages. Striking the right balance is a difficult challenge, but one that can yield spectacular results.|~|Theodore Furchtgott is a freshman from Chevy Chase, Md. He can be reached at trf2@princeton.edu. 
78321|~|On measles|~|   February 12 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Julia Case-Levine|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The latest victims of the California measles outbreak are college students. As of Feb. 3, students at three different public colleges were believed to have contracted measles. The outbreak of measles this year has been the most serious in years, pushing policy makers to reconsider how to contain and quell this disease that has been virtually eradicated since 2000, when effective and widespread vaccination immunized the majority of the public. Making vaccine injection compulsory has become a hot topic among legislators, with politicians like N.J. Gov. and ex-officio University trustee Chris Christie drawing criticism for supporting parents’ choice to vaccinate. Given that 22 states do not require measles immunizations for college students, some universities are wondering if it is time for a policy change. Following the current outbreak, California schools have plans to make the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine a required immunization for incoming students by 2017. University policy currently mandates the MMR vaccine in accordance with New Jersey law, which allows for religious-based exemptions from vaccination. Given the present incidence of measles, is the loophole in New Jersey law that allows parents and citizens to withhold from vaccination for non-medical reasons a point of potential concern? This debate highlights the tension between private liberty and public good; in an institution with diverse citizens of various beliefs and backgrounds, we are reminded constantly to respect and tolerate other views, to learn to coexist. But what happens when these opinions threaten our personal health? Do we still remain devoted to freedom of opinion and religion, even when these doctrines endanger others? As students at a private institution, our school’s greatest priority should be geared toward personal health. As university students we have the right to safety, the right to know that coexisting will not physically harm us. For those who subscribe to the scientific evidence in favor of vaccine safety, mandating vaccination might seem like a no-brainer. Unvaccinated individuals threaten the health of larger communities, including those who cannot be vaccinated because they are too young, necessitate medical exemptions or have not maintained a sufficient immune response to deem them insusceptible to disease. That said, mandating all community members to vaccinate, including those with deep religious or philosophical qualms, may be counterintuitive when trying to increase overall community vaccination rates. Instead of increasing vaccination, mandates can serve to outrage, animate and propel the anti-vaccine community. While allowing non-medical exemptions to vaccination pose serious threats to communities, enforcing compulsory vaccination may be even more destructive to public health. Compulsory vaccination laws have historically galvanized anti-vaccination movements, while efforts to educate the public on the benefits of vaccination while allowing non-medical exemptions proved more successful. However, it still remains crucial that non-medical exemptions are extremely restricted. Research has shown that states with loose exemption policies typically have more parents filing for non-medical exemptions and a higher incidence of vaccine-preventable disease. Obtaining non-medical exemptions must be harder than just signing a form. Effective policies should require citizens to thoroughly consider the consequences of not vaccinating, mandating multiple discussions with physicians and requiring a thorough, written explanation of reasons for avoiding vaccination. Additionally, exemptions ought to only be granted for a particular amount of time, and parents asked to reexamine their decision at regular and frequent intervals. Although the measles remains a particularly urgent and prevalent concern to a community across the country and may not currently threaten the health of University students, New Jersey and University policy on vaccination still necessitates conversation and review. Although vaccination is one of the most successful breakthroughs in the field of health, saving countless lives and reducing incidence of disease, the anti-vaccine movement has consistently grown in following thanks to the propagation of misinformation about vaccine safety and growing apathy towards vaccination. Because vaccines have become so effective, the consequences of disease are less tangible. In this sense, vaccines are a victim of their own success. This is a crisis we must address as future lawmakers, citizens and parents, balancing principles of autonomy and government tolerance of various religious and philosophical beliefs; allowing room for private liberty while still ultimately emphasizing public health. Correction: Due to a reporting error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the severity of the current measles outbreak. It is the most serious outbreak in recent years, but nobody has died of the disease yet. The ‘Prince’ regrets the error. |~|Julia Case-Levine is a freshman from New York, N.Y.

78319|~|Editorial: Join the Editorial Board|~|   February 12 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Last semester, the unsigned editorials featured on this page have discussed issues such as the construction of a campus pub, increasing the number of beginner-level precepts offered in introduction courses and encouraging activism at the University. The Daily Princetonian Editorial Board, a group of 15 undergraduates, was collectively responsible for writing these pieces. The members of the Board are not the editors of the various sections of the ‘Prince.’ Instead, they constitute an independent group of undergraduate students charged with determining the position of the newspaper as a whole. Today, instead of taking a stance on an issue, we would like to explain the editorial process and invite interested freshmen, sophomores and juniors to apply to join the Board. The Board is the independent body responsible for determining the position of the ‘Prince’ on a range of matters that affect the University, its campus community and our generation. We meet twice a week to discuss campus issues, solicit input from potential stakeholders and ultimately determine the stance the ‘Prince’ will take on the issue at hand. We work closely with other sections of the newspaper to gather information about editorial topics, but we deliberate behind closed doors and independently determine our own positions to preserve objectivity. The Board answers only to its chair, Jeffrey Leibenhaut; the Opinion Editor, Benjamin Dinovelli; and the Editor-in-Chief, Anna Mazarakis. While the Board strives for unanimity, editorial positions are determined by majority vote, and members take turns writing editorials. The majority opinion is signed collectively by the Editorial Board rather than the individuals who concurred with the position of the majority. The minority can also publish a dissent that will bear the names of the individuals dissenting, when they are particularly passionate about the issue. All majority opinions are the collective product of the Board and constitute an independent voice separate from other sections of the ‘Prince.’ Crucial to our mission is the ability to incorporate a variety of diverse perspectives into the editorials we produce. Current Board members come from around the globe and represent a wide variety of majors, political philosophies, and academic and extracurricular interests. What unites us is an engagement in campus life, and a commitment to investigating and discussing issues pertaining to the University community. We are committed to bringing compelling arguments and perspectives to this page, criticizing and praising in equal measure. We try to recommend specific policies or actions for the University that, in our opinion, are best for the community as a whole. For us, its members, the Board is one of the defining activities of our time at the University. From the (relative) comfort of our fourth-floor conference room, we engage in challenging, passionate and intellectually stimulating debates that lead us to examine and confront the full range of issues that affect our lives at the University. It is especially exciting when our suggestions make a lasting contribution to broader campus discussions about an issue, or when the University adopts them, such as the computer science department’s decision to keep the pass/D/fail option available for COS 126: General Computer Science, and the Honor Committee’s decision to modify its punishment for students who take extra time on tests. Our aim is to inspire discussion and, ultimately, action. However, this is impossible without students with unique perspectives — independent thinkers who are eager to debate and willing to engage with issues important to the University. We value writing ability, creativity and strength of thought much more than journalistic experience. If you are interested in joining us, we encourage you to fill out our application by midnight on Monday, Feb. 16. Applicants will be interviewed shortly thereafter. We look forward to meeting you!|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief. 
78180|~|The equality problem in entertainment award-granting|~|   February 11 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|First things first, I’m not afraid to admit I like Iggy Azalea’s music. I jam to her aggressive lyrics about pageantry (see “Murda Bizness” music video), female empowerment (note the “Kill Bill” allusions in her “Black Widow” video), and her rise against poverty (see “Work”). But when it comes to questions of how her identity affects the entire rap industry as a genre, I am less certain. As a white rapper from Australia, she is frequently accused of appropriating a genre that originates in African-American culture. Contrastingly, because she is a woman, many argue that her success in a traditionally male-dominated sphere challenges hip-hop’s masculine ideal. While I have not settled my opinion on Iggy, her success has provoked numerous discussions that have undoubtedly given me a race- and gender-tinted lens toward entertainment. I love awards shows, and these questions of race and gender in the entertainment industry were recently rekindled with the 2015 Oscar nominations and Grammy Awards. The Oscars have raised complaints that the Academy is tone-deaf with regard to issues of race and gender: All five nominees for Best Actor are white. “Selma”, which received full-bodied applause at the Garden Theatre, has only received two nominations in total. No female writers or directors were included in the race. According to a 2012 study by the L. A. Times, of the roughly 6,000 Oscar voters, 94 percent are white, 77 percent are male, and only 14 percent are under the age of 50. Similar criticisms emerged with Sunday’s Grammy Awards, when Beyoncé’s groundbreaking album “Beyoncé” lost out to Beck, who is somewhat a relic of the 90s. In a response that mirrored widespread reactions to the Oscars, critics argued that Grammy voters are just too old, too white and too male to appreciate the cultural context of contemporary music. This being the case, large award-granting institutions should practice affirmative action and consider race, gender, and sexual orientation when choosing voting members, perhaps even setting numerical targets that reflect the demographic composition of the US population. The mission of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is to advance filmmaking, while improving the image of the industry. Likewise, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences strives to recognize the “best in music,” while positively impacting the lives of musicians and “society at large.” However, the lack of equal representation in their voting bodies hinders their good intentions. Obviously, the quality of art is subjective; it can’t be judged with a rubric. So instead, the Academy literally instructs its voters to “follow their hearts” (according to an exposé about the Oscar nomination process). Voters are liable to vote for movies that resonate with them the most, a factor that may be strongly shaped by their respective backgrounds of largely white and largely male heritage. As a result, movies that concern minority values, issues and experiences are often placed at a disadvantage. This is problematic because the winning movies are not necessarily the ones that the much more diverse public roots for. And when movies like 12 Years a Slave do win, their victories are often misattributed to “guilt,” rather than their actual artistic value or their ability to connect with people. This is problematic when we consider that art is a reflection of the present, a fact particularly true with movies and music as stalwart pillars of popular culture. When these institutions “snub” minority art despite extremely positive reviews and projections to win by the public, they undermine the ideas of minority groups. The ability of voters to see what is the “best” art is inherently limited, and the lack of equality in these institutions only exacerbates this blind spot. In addition, explicit recognition of minority films and music — of minority musicians, actors, directors and writers — creates role models who bring attention to important issues. In her acceptance speech, Lupita Nyong’o brought light to her struggle with feeling beautiful as a black woman. To have such a prominent figure openly discuss racial- and gender-specific problems is so powerful. It encourages people who might not have otherwise pursued goals in the entertainment industry to do so by teaching them that they can be commercially successful. New shows like “Fresh Off the Boat” — about the experiences of an Asian American family — need recognition to be sustained and to show minorities that we value their presence in pop culture. This makes affirmative action an effective way to create long-term change in the industry, increasing the visibility and power of ideas and messages important to under-represented groups. A diverse voting body for the Grammys could finally answer the Iggy question. Is she given undue success because she is white, and does her prominence usurp minority rappers? (Something to ponder is that badass M.I.A. of Sri Lankan heritage does not elicit such protests.) Perhaps official recognition by non-white, non-male voters — able to connect with her music in spite of her racial “advantage” — will determine if Iggy is really the “realest” once and for all.|~|Jessica N.

78171|~|To flee or not to flee|~|   February 11 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The world has been watching Paris, and when Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu told the Jews of France “the state of Israel is your home,” the world understood what he implied: Flee, for you know you are not welcome in France. Flee, for France was never your home. Flee, as you have for generations. Flee, for there is no hope. My extended family is caught in this identity pretzel: French. Jewish. Immigrant. Citizen. Human. Although France has the world’s third largest Jewish population, it is also the most rapidly dwindling one: More than 6,000 French Jews fled in 2014 alone, the largest exodus from any other nation to Israel. But this is not about who is leaving France or where they are going; it’s about who is staying. First, Netanyahu’s call for emigration raises questions of home within and outside of France and fails to see the role of choosing to live in France as integral to fostering a safe, diverse society. Netanyahu implied that France is not “home” for French Jews, merely some sort of transient, unwelcoming place to settle for a while. If French Jews are to truly thrive, they must live among non-Jews and be able to connect, as people and as fellow French citizens. The breakdown of stereotypes and dissolving of hatred will only come with coexistence. To politely imply that the Jewish people should leave France is an erasure of an important version of the shared history of France. Second, the Prime Minister exaggerates the level of danger in Paris by narrowly focusing on recent events. Paris, despite certain reports, is not a war zone. I understand why some are pointing to the attack at Hyper Cacher on Jan. 9 as an example of instability and lack of security for Jewish people living in France. It is also certainly not the only anti-Semitic attack in recent memory. From the vicious kidnapping and murder of Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old Jewish man of Moroccan descent, to the attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse, a well-picked group of headlines can serve as a fabulous scare tactic. Such scare tactics, at the very least, stunt tolerance, and at the very worst, traumatize the population who needs support in this moment more than ever. To call on the Jewish residents of France to flee their home is to recognize neither the potential for assimilation nor the possibility of peace. Third, the people of France, including their government, have a proven record of holding themselves accountable for past crimes against their Jewish population with the purpose of creating a safe home for this community. Long before these attacks, France has been active in remembering crimes against its Jews. In my opinion, France has succeeded in creating some of the most effective public displays of historical memory in the world. Outside every school where children were deported during World War II is a dedicated plaque that reads: “à la mémoire des élèves de cette école déportés de 1942 à 1944 parce qu’ils étaient nés juifs, victimes innocentes de la barbarie nazie avec la complicité active du gouvernement de Vichy. Ne les oublions jamais.” It translates to: In memory of the students of this school who were deported between 1942 and 1944 because they were born Jewish, the innocent victims of the barbaric Nazi regime along with the active collusion of the Vichy government. We never forget them. In theory, assimilation is easy. In theory, acceptance is possible. In theory, post-Charlie Hebdo Paris is much more welcoming to its Jewish, Muslim and many other varied minority populations. In reality, assimilation and acceptance are tiring processes whose fruits are only known by those generations long after the ones who sowed the seeds. This is not an excuse; France’s Jews should seize this moment of terror and use it as a uniting force for reconciliation. Le Marais, the heart of the Jewish quarter of Paris, bustles as usual with its numerous falafel vendors, but now there are armed guards standing alongside hungry customers. The falafel vendors often gift the guards a kebab or pita bread sandwich in gratitude for their protection — it is in these small interactions between communities that Paris will mend her shattered trust. France is fighting itself in the present; France is fighting for its future. My family is every bit as French as their Catholic or Muslim or Atheist or Anything neighbors. We must believe in France’s ability to take care of its minority citizens. We must believe in the power of diversity. We must believe that Jewish people have the right to remain where they call home. In 1894, Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jew, was accused of espionage and convicted of treason. Émile Zola, a prominent French writer, famously wrote an open letter “J’accuse” (I accuse) to the French government calling out the anti-Semitism in the original accusation, causing an investigation into the evidence that was determined to be baseless; Dreyfus was exonerated. Prime Minister Netanyahu, J’accuse. I accuse you of hurting the Jewish people by implying we should self-segregate. I accuse you of irresponsibly underestimating the power of acceptance that absolutely is possible in Paris. I accuse you of hindering our potential to teach our religion and learn about others’ religions and love the diversity that enriches our Jewish history — Jewish history that lives in so many places outside of Israel. After all, the Judaism I am proud of was born of fearless leaders who believed in universal truths, who stood tall in the face of injustice and violence and believed in their right to practice their prayers wherever they called home.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

78191|~|Tigers don't bow: how the archery team came on target|~|   February 11 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|When I first came to Princeton, I was convinced there must be a secret underground archery team. I had talked to numerous campus officials, administrators and even students who told me “It sounds familiar” or “I think I’ve heard of them”, and foolish pre-frosh me was too naïve to realize that admissions officers were simply telling me what I wanted to hear. By far, the biggest fallacy I was told repeatedly was “Even if we don’t have a team, you can always start one. It’s really easy to start clubs at Princeton!” And so, come September, I found myself wandering aimlessly through the activities fair, dodging flyers and aggressive upperclassmen, until I somehow wound up in the Sport Clubs Office. That’s when someone finally told me the hard truth: Princeton did not have an archery program, nor would it probably ever have one. Three years after hearing that denial, we are heading to Nationals. Despite this, the process of founding the archery team has been an arduous one, and I have faced more rejection in the process than I have anywhere else. When I first approached the director of club sports, he told me no. Even, when I tried talking with more flexible administrators, they ultimately kept pointing me back to club sports, which repeatedly turned down ideas again, and again, and again. Practicing on campus was too dangerous, owning equipment was too much of a liability and giving funding to our team would take away funding from other teams. But facing rejection is what being an athlete is all about. You have to learn how to miss the target multiple times, refocus and start shooting bull’s-eyes. Learning to overcome challenges is one of the main reasons I wanted to bring archery to Princeton. Archery taught me how to face failure and especially how to perform under pressure, a skill every Princeton student grapples with. It made me a better student and a better person. That’s why I was so surprised that the University was so adamantly opposed to the creation of a club archery team. Physically, archery is one of the safest sports, with a lower accident rate than even golf. Emotionally, the team was meant to be a haven from all the Princeton craziness, a place where students didn’t have to be judged and where students could gain something from simply being part of the team. The best part about archery is that you don’t have to be fast or strong. Some natural ability can help, but all you really need to excel is focus and dedication. It seemed like a perfect fit for Princeton students. Instead, we got into a vicious cycle: we couldn’t be sanctioned by the University without holding practices, we couldn’t hold practices without equipment, we couldn’t get equipment without being sanctioned. Help finally came not from the University, but from random community members who agreed to let us use their facilities, even though they had absolutely no obligation to help or even any reason to trust us with their equipment at all. When a random community member is willing to talk with you for over an hour on the phone, but University officials can’t even take 30 seconds to reply to an email, it is clear that there is a problem with the system. The problem traces back to an unwillingness to take risks. Princeton fears the rejection that so many of us have to deal with, and so they refuse to support new teams until the teams have already shown they will be successful. Some teams take international training trips every year, while we went to our first tournament wearing orange t-shirts colored with sharpies because we lacked funding for real uniforms. Archery was only listed as a club sport on Princeton’s website six months after we had our own website. If Princeton wants to advertise itself as a place where students can found new organizations, it needs to actually provide funding and assistance to teams that are struggling, instead of rewarding teams that are already successful. Now that we have found off-campus practice space, off-campus storage space and begun our own fundraising, the Sport Clubs Office has provided us with more resources. At Nationals in five weeks, realistically, our team is probably going to be crushed by other college teams with real funding, real coaches and real equipment, but frankly, I don’t care. Our team is about persistence, dedication, and no judgment, not about getting trophies.  And who knows? Maybe we will win. If there’s one thing we’re good at, it’s not giving up, a principle Princeton should be embracing and not shunning.|~|Anjalie Field is a computer science major from Haverford, Pa.

77954|~|On expanding internship funding|~|   February 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|As University students, we are given access to a wide array of summer internship opportunities. It’s true — we have the International Internship Program, Keller Center internships, Princeton Internships in Civic Service, and several career fairs to help students find external internships independent of these programs. These programs are distinct, in that IIP internships stress experience abroad in all different fields, Keller Center internships emphasize engineering and entrepreneurial fields, and PICS internships offers civic service-oriented experiences. However, not all opportunities are financially accessible. Students who can’t find their own paid internships look to University programs for additional opportunities, only to find that there is an unequal distribution of funds. Some opportunities cover housing and travel costs, others are unpaid and offer minimal stipends. This disparity in funding places some programs at a premium over others, when a student’s choice should ultimately depend on interest and fit, rather than financial concerns. IIP internships are particularly generous with financial support. The IIP website states that “All IIP placements … automatically qualify for an internship award.” For students on financial aid, this covers “airfare, … accommodation, meals, and local transportation to and from work.” For students not on financial aid, the award still includes “accommodation, meals, and local transportation to and from work.” Additionally, students looking for additional funding are permitted to look on the Student Activities Funding Engine to cover any incidental costs like visas or vaccinations, regardless of their financial status. This generosity in financial support allows all qualified students to participate in the IIP program. However, most PICS internships give a $450 stipend per week. Although this stipend could be enough to cover accommodation and travel for some internships, this amount is not nearly enough for others. For example, many of the PICS opportunities are located in expensive cities, and the stipend would definitely not cover housing or travel costs, deterring students from taking these opportunities. Even more discouraging, some Keller Center entrepreneurial internships are both unpaid and offer no stipend whatsoever, leaving students to look on their own for SAFE funding or for the Keller Center to give a small fixed amount (I got $1,500) for the entire summer. SAFE funding is not an adequate supplement for an entire summer worth of expenses, since SAFE is application-based and thus by no means guaranteed. This forces students to make a difficult decision — whether to shoulder the cost in order to gain more experience, or to forgo the opportunity altogether. It is admirable that programs like IIP do cover so many of the expenses of their summer opportunities, but to have more funding for IIP than for other programs puts a premium that should not exist on those international opportunities. Even if a student is truly interested in the Keller Center’s entrepreneurial opportunities or PICS civic service-related opportunities, they may apply to IIP instead because of the generous funding. This makes IIP more competitive compared to the other programs and also attracts students who may not be wholly interested in it. If the objective of these Princeton programs is to help students gain experience in a field of their interest and to make those programs accessible to as many people as possible, funding should be expanded for PICS and Keller Center internships to match the generosity of IIP. In all other aspects of Princeton, whether it is tuition, Outdoor Action or study abroad, students who are not as financially capable are given the support they need in order to have access to the same opportunities and resources as everybody else. There is no reason that the University’s internship programs should not do the same.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

77997|~|Pledge of allegiance|~|   February 10 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Coy Ozias|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Why do public school children pledge their allegiance to “one nation under God” every morning despite America’s separation of church and state? In our nation’s schools, children say these words while placing their hands over their hearts, paying for their school lunches using currency stamped with the words “In God We Trust.” How has this unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism been sustained? Surprisingly, the Pledge of Allegiance did not originate with the nation’s founding. Rather, it was an invention of the socialist minister Francis Bellamy, who wrote the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892 to be used as an expression of patriotic devotion. The original pledge was written as follows: I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Notice anything missing? Yes, you’re right, there is no mention of “God.” However, it was not always that way. Rather, it was a product of the anti-communist, anti-atheist hysteria surrounding the Cold War. In 1948, Louis Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, altered the wording to include “under God” at a meeting of the Sons of the American Revolution. In the midst of a culture rife with fear over the atheist Soviet Union, further bolstered by the rise of McCarthyism, the mention of God served as a way to differentiate the United States and reaffirm its values. As a Cold Warrior and a devout Presbyterian, President Eisenhower heavily pushed a bill through Congress under Michigan Republican Charles Oakman to make the modification official. On June 14, 1954, “under God” became part of our nation’s pledge. Some find this history surprising, but also troubling. Many irrational things happened during the Cold War. Joseph McCarthy gained popularity by wildly naming off lists of supposed communists. The country was caught in a witch-hunt hysteria. We now realize that many of the actions that took place during the Cold War era were wrong and unnecessary. But somehow, we maintain a law from this time despite its disregard for the separation of church and state. Why? I believe it is because many people are completely unaware of the history that I have just laid out. In a recent survey conducted by LifeWay Research about the public’s perception of the words “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance, only 8 percent of respondents favored removing the phrase. However, when the American Humanist Association conducted a similar survey asking the same question, but also including a brief history before the question, the results vastly differed. By including the phrase, “ ‘under God’ was only added as recently as 1954 in response to the Cold War and that some Americans feel that the Pledge should focus on unity rather than religion,” 34 percent of respondents said they favored removing the words. Many claim that non-believers can simply ignore the Pledge and choose to opt out. However, this creates an opt-out system rather than an opt-in one. In doing so, those who choose not to participate in the pledge make themselves stand out. As an impressionable high schooler who may fear being marginalized, it is easy to go with the flow instead. For instance, one of my friends in high school announced that he did not stand because of the reference to God. Every day, while the rest of us stood with our hands over our hearts, he sat alone in silence, becoming a disobedient outsider in the process. By including “under God” in the pledge, an associative chain is created that links liberty, justice and patriotism to religion. Children are indoctrinated from a young age to believe that you cannot have one without the other. They are led to believe that to be patriotic is to be religious. Many children may believe that if they do not believe in an Abrahamic God, it isolates them from the other ideals of the pledge. American children should be able to express their patriotism without having to segregate themselves on the basis of their religious beliefs. I am not suggesting a war on religion. Neither is this a crusade against Americans who believe in God. Practicing one’s own private religion freely is fully acceptable and Constitutional. However, it is not acceptable to force others to publicly pledge their allegiance to someone else’s religion and someone else’s God. Removing “under God” from the pledge would not undermine the lives of millions of proud, religious Americans. Neither does it violate any of their rights. Rather, it restores rights to those who do not believe. It also protects Christians, who are the current religious majority, from having other religions potentially forced down their throats in the future. In this way it actually would be beneficial for Christians to embrace this change. The United States is not an institutionally religious nation. While the majority of the country’s citizens may be religious in their private lives, the United States is a nation with not only freedom of religion but also freedom from religion, ever since the pilgrims fled to this country to avoid Anglicanism in England in the 1600s. The Cold War was a hysterical time, and tradition should not be used to prolong an inappropriate and antiquated phrase. The Cold War is over; let’s bring separation of church and state back to America and back to our schools.|~|Coy Ozias is a freshman from Christiansburg, Va.

77856|~|Teachers who look like us|~|   February 9 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Most of my professors have been women. It’s not a large majority — I have had roughly 8 female professors for every 7 male ones, but that ratio is the highest I’ve heard of among my peers. Most of my friends, on the other hand, have had male professor ratios far surpassing the 50 percent mark. One of my friends, another senior in the Politics Department, tells me that the vast majority of her instructors have been white men. A senior majoring in Computer Science has taken courses with a grand total of six female professors in her four years here. A junior in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering has only had one female professor in the entirety of his time at Princeton.  His teachers, too, are mostly white — but he assures me that some are European. At least Princeton has that international diversity factor down. At the Center for Jewish Life, a common topic of conversation is whether or not a specific teacher has Jewish ancestry. We frequently debate the etymology of a last name and compare anecdotes from lecture that support our identification of the professorial specimen in question. “He said schlep,” someone will announce gleefully. “Definitely a member of the tribe.” We care about the association because it brings the professor closer to us. It brings Princeton closer to us. It’s no accident that I am drawn to courses taught by women. The number of Jewish professors I have had also significantly influenced my undergraduate experience. We want some of our mentors and teachers to look like us, to speak the same language (“schlep” and “kvetch”, for example, are to my ear what mom’s chicken soup is to my stomach), and to share the same cultural collective memory. In short, we want to relate. There is great value to having role models and instructors whose stories fit our stories. Their backgrounds reflect our backgrounds and they show us what we can become. This relatability is not only relevant for those interested in academia, but for those entering the professional fields related to their major as well. A professor in the Computer Science Department clearly inspires his students to pursue a diverse trajectory of career paths. I use a male pronoun in the preceding sentence very deliberately. On the faculty page of the department’s website, only thirteen of the fifty-eight people listed are women. The male undergraduates in the department lose out by this faculty imbalance almost as much as their female peers do; the disadvantages of homogeneity aren’t limited to minority groups. The advantages of learning from professors with cultural and racial backgrounds that differ from our own are manifold and obvious. They offer us new perspectives, challenge what we know about the world, and teach us to respect difference. The lack of diversity in some of Princeton’s academic departments bites both ways. Female students majoring in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering or Computer Science don’t have access to many female role models, and their male peers are limited to a pick of professors who tend to represent an exciting number of shades of white. I asked a Korean American friend, also a senior, if she has had any East Asian teachers. She hesitated. “Yes,” she finally answered. “But only for my Asian Studies classes.” Diversity varies widely across the different departments. President Eisgruber’s statement on the Trustee Ad Hoc Committee on Diversity’s Report, given at the beginning of his tenure as University President, announces that “in some academic departments, for example, progress toward diversifying the faculty will be limited until Princeton and other universities diversify their doctoral programs.” The Trustee Committee’s suggestion for diverse faculty hiring practices is such a tangle of jargon that it’s hard to parse out how its vague propositions actually translate into diversity. There is one compelling section that discusses the importance of mentorship within the faculty. “Mentoring is critical to faculty member success,” the committee tells us. If mentorship is critical for academics whom have already chosen their life path and their fields of expertise, how can we begin to measure its effect on directionless undergraduates? And if Princeton waits for its diverse student body to grow up and supply specific departments with the diversity they now lack, how likely is it that black or female students will actually pursue studies in a department where they are so starkly underrepresented? President Christopher Eisgruber ’83’s statement mentions the success of Princeton’s work diversifying the undergraduate student body. My class may boast a spectrum of colors, nationalities, cultures, and an even gender divide, but as long as so many department faculty rosters (and I’m not just talking about STEM) do not reflect the University’s avowed commitment to diversity, minority students will remain minorities in more than just numbers.|~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio.

77822|~|The value of faith and reflection|~|   February 9 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|If you know me, then you know there are few things in life that make me more uncomfortable than the prospect of singing in public. I can kill a bug without blinking, I’m a veritable pyromaniac, and the sight of blood does not make me squeamish. But even just writing of the possibility of unleashing my tone-deaf, rhythmically-challenged self unto the world makes my stomach flip on its side. Over intersession, then, I found myself confronted with this very possibility, but, crucially, I would not be singing alone. Two hundred other students filled the hall around me, their voices raised towards the sky. And yet, I still could not join in, not for a fear of judgment or scorn, but because of the songs themselves; I was on Princeton Faith and Action’s annual Ski Safari, and the men and women around me were exalting God and Jesus with a passion that took my breath away. This passion is precisely why I did not add my voice to the mix. One of my close friends, and the friend who convinced me to go on the trip in the first place, later asked me why I didn’t, and the best I could offer her were words of discomfort. The exact fountain from which these feelings sprang eluded me in that moment, and only as I lay in bed later in the crawl space between sleep and wakefulness did the reasons become clear. I am a spiritual person in that I believe in a higher power and in various practices reminiscent of a mix between prayer and meditation; however, I would not say that I am religious. For this reason, my discomfort in singing stemmed originally from the fact that I did not believe much of what lay in the words. My friend told me that this didn’t matter, that others would not feel disrespected, as I expected and feared they would. And yet, the next night, the same creeping sense of paralysis invaded my being as we sang again. Again, only later did I identify just why my muscles refused to even let me sway along to the rhythm set by the drums. It wasn’t just the fact that I didn’t feel like a true believer or that I feared being disrespectful towards those who felt the words in the far reaches of their souls, but also the fact that there would be no time for reflection. I sought to reflect not only upon my personal beliefs in relation to what I heard, but also upon the emotions that I could feel myself suppressing as a way to better engage with those around me and, to some extent, with myself. The sermons delivered every night, on the other hand, held me transfixed in their universality (despite being intimately linked to the Bible) and left my mind reeling for hours afterwards. The man who delivered them spoke of wishing for a home and of hope and fear and many other feelings that cut across pretty much any dividing lines. However, there’s something more freeing and more passionate in music, I think, and to some extent I wish that I had allowed myself to sing. To do so would have perhaps been to gain an experience that would further extend my knowledge of Christianity, which itself was one of the main motivations behind my decision to go on the trip in the first place. I’m happy and feel as though I learned a lot just by hearing the words found in the Book of Isaiah interpreted by a man for whom I have much respect, but I wonder if I could have gained a firmer grasp of what those around me feel and think and believe if I had allowed my reservations to drop away — if I had had a little more faith. I also have to wonder what about this experience was different than one I had in high school at a friend’s house during a major Hindu holiday, during which her entire family exhorted me to sing along with several hymns, and I did. There’s something to be said for the community that was forged by my willingness to engage, no matter my own beliefs, and to suspend any reflection until later. Perhaps this is what religion can be to some people — leaps of faith leading to said reflection on oneself, one’s community, and the greater world around us. Perhaps I was just more open years ago, and less cautious. Perhaps I’m wrong. Perhaps being wrong and questioning yourself until you get it right is actually a component of religion itself. Perhaps any generalizations like these are inherently wrong. But, in the end, these musings lead me to the same point; namely, that blind faith is sometimes just as valuable as prolonged reflection that yields the same result.|~|Kelly Hatfield is a sophomore from Medford, Mass.

77817|~|The age of the hermit|~|   February 9 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|It turns out that college students are becoming hermits, particularly freshmen. But seriously, what with only 18 percent spending at least two to three hours per day with friends, their lives have become increasingly hermitic, according to a recent study from the University of California, Los Angeles’s Higher Education Research Institute. Compare this figure to 1987, when almost 38 percent of incoming college students socialized at least two to three hours per day. This difference is cause for concern. The study also showed that today’s college freshmen are more depressed due to spending less time interacting with people, coupled with spending more time on social media. About 10 percent of freshmen reported experiencing frequent depression, which is a four percent increase in only the past five years, and the numbers only seem to be rising. Of course, depression — and reclusiveness — is no singular problem. 30 percent of all college students report feeling “so depressed that it was difficult to function” once in college, and the fact that freshmen constitute almost one-third of this figure is astounding. However, this study is indicative of a larger problem. We have grown numb to the issue. These statistics have just become another number to us, and under the unceasing pressures of college, more students becoming depressed comes as no surprise. There appear to be three facets that have driven this problem: social media, a lack of empathy and living in a bubble. Let’s take a look at our use of social media. According to the International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology, there is a direct link between social media use and depression. Social media allows us to construct an idealized version of ourselves. By plastering our “idealized” lives all over social media, we compel ourselves to live up to these standards. But then when we see others actually live up to these seemingly higher standards, while we are not always so successful ourselves, we feel envy and pressure, perpetuating this vicious cycle. The Princeton Perspective Project aimed to counter this culture by discussing how perfection is not a perceived norm. Through framing failure as a formative experience, they hoped to create a different culture and open community where our flaws and weaknesses were embraced. Although the issue addressed academic failure, it was completely blind to other forms of insecurities. And while students sharing their own stories of struggle and failure contributed to the dialogue, the project was somewhat ironic. In the profile pictures used to advertise the Perspective Project, students looked, well, perfect. Perhaps the message sent inevitably shifted to at least keeping up a pristine pretense, despite our vulnerabilities. Then there’s a dearth of empathy and a prevalent inability to understand what others may be going through. In fact, college students have become increasingly less empathetic with time. While we may think that this is attributable to no fault of our own, we can make more of an effort to be more compassionate and understanding of others’ perspectives and experiences. After all, 98 percent of people have the capacity for empathy, but we continue to remain apathetic. Be it someone struggling with mental health or body image issues, posing an opinion different to our own or trying to relate to someone who doesn’t open up much, we need to go beyond superficial conversation or perhaps just listen to him or her. Plus, a simple “hello” and a smile remain underrated in day-to-day interaction, particularly with strangers. And then there’s the fact that as Princeton students, we are essentially living within our own bubbles in a larger orange bubble. Undeniably, we are all always busy. But everyone else is too, so the burden remains on us to set time aside to see our friends. Most people, if not all, can attest to how common and accepted a practice it has become to give being busy as an excuse to not be able to hang out with someone. If we’re truly unable to set time aside, asking someone to study or grab a meal together makes more efficient use of time. As Mary Oliver points out in her poem “Dog Songs,” “We meet wonderful people, but lose them/in our busyness.” If we don’t see our friends, not only do we adopt a hermitic lifestyle, as aforementioned, but we inadvertently begin to underappreciate our personal relationships amidst a wide array of commitments. It’s healthy, sane and simply necessary to socialize, even for the innately introverted people out there. It’s time to come out of the Dark Ages — the Age of the Hermit. So put your phone away and ask to spend time with that person you’re texting in person instead, so that both of you get to spend time interacting face-to-face and take a hiatus from interminably sitting in front of a screen.|~|

77708|~|Editorial: Providing gender-neutral bathrooms|~|   February 8 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|From supporting a gender binary to inconvenient bathroom codes, Princeton’s bathroom system has long been criticized by students. In comparison to some of our peer institutions, the University fails to provide inclusive facilities for students who do not necessarily identify as a certain gender. In addition to issues of gender inclusivity, many students have found issue with codes on female bathrooms. In order to address these issues, the Editorial Board believes the University should increase the number of gender-neutral bathrooms on campus. First, many of our peer institutions have adopted gender-neutral bathrooms to address inclusivity and equity. For example, Brown has many gender-inclusive bathrooms in buildings around campus, which are listed online for students. Currently, the University’s LGBT Center publishes an online map of all gender-neutral and single-stall bathrooms on campus. However, many of the bathrooms shown on this map are single-stall bathrooms marked either as Men’s or Women’s. By supporting this gender binary, Princeton forces students to choose between a men and women’s bathroom and does not accommodate students who identify outside of this binary. The Board feels that these bathrooms are not truly inclusive and welcoming, and urges the University to increase the gender-neutral options that are available in residential spaces. The availability of gender-neutral options ensures that there are facilities available to all students regardless of their gender. For example, if a gender nonconforming or transgender person uses a bathroom that does not correspond with the gender people mark them as, they can feel generally unsafe and unwelcome in these gendered spaces. This not only questions their gender identity and experiences, but also does not allow for the safety and inclusivity of all students. In an effort to increase inclusivity, the Board recommends that the University designate at least one gender-neutral bathroom in every building when it is feasible and legally possible. We recognize, for instance, that this is not possible in the few buildings that only have a small number of male and female bathrooms. Thus, in buildings with multiple bathrooms, we recommend that the University convert an existing gendered bathroom into a gender-neutral one if a gender-neutral bathroom is not already present. This would ensure a gendered bathroom in each building and a gender-neutral bathroom in most. The Board is also supportive of single-stall bathrooms, but recognizes that construction and renovation costs may be an initial barrier. Secondly, gender-neutral bathrooms in dorm buildings would help solve the issue of convenience. Women who do not know the bathroom code could simply use the gender-neutral bathroom. The Board recognizes that many female students on campus are supportive of a bathroom code for security and other reasons. However, gender-neutral bathrooms are not meant to be coercive. Should female students feel uncomfortable using them, they can simply continue to use coded bathrooms. Taking this into account, the Board further recommends that if a building were to have an equal number of male and female bathrooms, one male bathroom should be converted into a gender-neutral one. This would ensure that there is no decrease in the number of coded female bathrooms. Furthermore, if safety breaches prove to be a big concern, the University could look into installing locked doors for showers, which would be an improvement from the curtains currently installed. Gender-neutral bathrooms are not meant to be coercive, and the Board recognizes that many female students who use coded restrooms feel most safe in that environment. Taking this as well as New Jersey state laws that mandate the number of women’s bathrooms in a building into account, the Board recommends that if a building were to have an equal number of male and female bathrooms, one male bathroom should be converted into a gender-neutral one. This would ensure that there is no decrease in the number of coded female bathrooms. The Board further recognizes that male students may prefer to use gendered bathrooms and may feel inconvenienced by the gender-neutral option. But because the University’s room draw process allows students to consider their proximity to their restroom of choice when selecting rooms, this perceived inconvenience could be avoided. Gender-neutral bathrooms are not meant to be coercive or restrictive. Instead, the Board believes that they will give the student body more choice and flexibility. Students who wish to continue using gendered and coded bathrooms can continue to do so. However, the increase of gender-neutral bathrooms would offer a safe and inclusive space both for students no matter their gender. Dissent We disagree for three reasons: (1) The Board’s proposal is not something most students want; (2) there is a better, less controversial solution to the bathroom inconveniences and (3) designating multi-person gender-neutral bathrooms sends a problematic message. The student body does not consider gender-neutral bathrooms the requisite solution to the problem of bathroom code inconvenience.  According to the poll mentioned by the Board, 54.7 percent of 1,635 students voted to abolish bathroom codes; however, on the USG’s allourideas.org polling site, the proposal that there be “more unisex bathrooms” ranked 125th in popularity out of 130 University policy suggestions. A better solution is to add single-stall bathrooms wherever feasible. Comfortably usable by anyone, they inconvenience no one and provide safe, private environments. If accommodating bathroom choices is truly so critical an issue, why not face the costs?  The Board’s proposal comes with a price-tag as well, especially if showers need to be retrofitted with locking doors for safety reasons. Finally, sponsoring the proliferation of gender-neutral bathrooms (besides ordinary single-stalls) sends the troubling message that sexual distinctions are unimportant and that gender confusion is better accommodated than addressed. Gender dysphoria is a serious problem and a source of real anguish; gender-neutral bathrooms would exacerbate rather than help resolve gender confusion. For these reasons, we respectfully dissent.|~|
77675|~|Why we should all study abroad|~|   February 8 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|Choosing to study abroad in Barcelona was one of the best decisions I could have made while at Princeton and for a number of different reasons. One, I was able to gain a greater sense of self-confidence and autonomy as I navigated a new city. Being able to take a respite from the unending hustle and bustle of Princeton had many perks: I was also able to seriously consider my post-graduate future without stressing about the present. Additionally, it allowed me to truly enjoy all the new things I was able to learn without the pressure of grading. Perhaps the best and most significant part of studying abroad was being a part of a new culture and seeing how it fit with my studies. Although I missed my friends and many parts of campus life, I realized it was an experience I would have never gotten if I had stayed inside of FitzRandolph Gate. Studying in Barcelona, where the Wilson School holds a task force for its students abroad, I took a course titled “Annexations and Secessions in Europe and Catalonia/Spain.” The class focused on the gradually growing tensions between the Spanish government, Catalonia, the autonomous state in which Barcelona is located, and the latter’s increasingly loud calls for total independence from Spain. I am sure that such a topic would have been interesting had I studied it at Princeton. The story of Catalonia and its relationship with Spain is both an interesting and tumultuous one. Dating back to the War of the Spanish Succession, their history is filled with cultural repression and resistance, which culminated during the dark period of Francoist Spain. Yet, I didn’t truly understand the importance of being in the thick of the issue until I shared stories of my time in Barcelona with family and friends on my return back home. It was my first day there when I recognized just how important Catalan culture and the Catalan language were to the people of the region. I was in the Barcelona-El Prat airport when I saw the signage had three languages, typically with Catalan first, English second and Spanish (or rather, Castellano) third. These small details were the foundation for my junior paper on the linguistic relationship between Catalan and Castellano. From there, simply participating in the festivals and traditions of Catalonia made the tension between it and the national government a palpable one. I could see it as I stood amongst thousands waving their Catalan flags — with a blue star symbolizing support for independence — on La Diada, a day commemorating Catalonia’s fall to Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. Sitting in the awe-inspiring stadium of Camp Nou and hearing the crowd shout the FC Barcelona anthem — no doubt in Catalan —made clear how connected the club and the region are. Catalan pride was particularly great on one of my university’s campuses as I would pass up graffitied walls with a “V” emblem, declaring all students vote; it was made even more clear as going to class was sometimes impossible with student protests and marches. Needless to say, I would not have had a clear idea of the level of movement in Catalonia had I remained burrowed beneath Firestone Library simply reading about recall votes or independence movements. While reading is extremely valuable, I never would have known the true, unadulterated opinions of the regions’ politicians if our seminar hadn’t visited Catalan politicians in class or traveled to Madrid to interview members of the Cortes Generales, the legislature of Spain. Experiencing — rather than reading — about these issues not only made these issues truly unforgettable, but also helped contextualize their importance to me. Of course, it is not always feasible for people to immerse themselves in a new place like this, for financial reasons, issues of time or both, but there are instances when it is realistic. Fortunately, we have the resources and support of a university like Princeton, which can allow virtually any student with the desire and willingness to study abroad to do so. Studying abroad is not only critical for one’s own personal experiences. It is essential for us to remember that what we study in this sometimes far-removed university is more than an assignment or academic research — it is someone’s narrative. Sharing and examining this narrative as closely and fairly as possible is our responsibility not only for our own understanding, but also as academics. Physically going to the heart of the narrative will always render the best retelling of it.|~|Lea Trusty is a Wilson School major from Saint Rose, La. She can reached at ltrusty@princeton.edu. 
77677|~|Date rape is not a "learning experience”: The members of Princeton's Class of 1978 speak out|~|   February 8 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|We are members of Princeton’s Class of 1978 who feel it necessary to speak up about sexual assault and rape in response to the undue repeated attention the media has given to the self-proclaimed “Princeton Mom.” We believe we speak for the great majority of Princeton moms and dads, as well as alumni who do not have children, in saying rape in general — and date rape in particular — is inexcusable, rape survivors deserve our help and support and anyone who sexually assaults another person should be prosecuted legally. Unfortunately, the Princeton name continues to be associated with the “Princeton Mom’s” views. In a recent CNN interview, she belittled accusations of rape as merely the aftermath of a “clumsy hookup” and called sexual assault a “learning experience” for young women who drink too much alcohol or who don’t fend off their attackers by explicitly telling them to “stop and leave.” To fail to challenge such views damages decades of efforts to help women come forward after being sexually assaulted. It suggests to college women — indeed to all women — that it is really their fault that they were raped. Rape and sexual assault are violent crimes against persons of any gender. It is particularly disturbing when college students violate the trust of people they know. The mix of social pressure, alcohol and drugs, misguided beliefs about entitlement and power, and unclear messages from peers about what constitutes appropriate approval for sex all contribute to this phenomenon. Rape survivors may have years of posttraumatic stress disorder, lack of trust in others, depression and anxiety; long-term effects can be exacerbated when the rape is committed by a date or an acquaintance. We know this first-hand — some of us from personal experience at Princeton and elsewhere and others from the experiences of our children and friends. And while we know that Princeton, like many other colleges and universities, has been struggling to find the right balance between the rights of the accused and protections for the victims, we believe that for far too long the attitudes of the so-called “Princeton Mom” have pervaded many campuses, even if not spoken as loudly. Fortunately, we are hardly alone in our opinions. In March 2014, The Daily Princetonian quoted the “Princeton Mom” as comparing a woman who gets raped to someone who doesn’t look both ways before crossing the street and gets hit by a car. Over 200 faculty members signed an open letter to the paper deriding these comments and expressing their support for survivors of sexual assault on campus. Numerous groups, including the University’s Men Against Violence Resources and Intervention Project and the Editorial Board of the ‘Prince’, also spoke out. In response to her latest comments, U.S. News & World Report asked why CNN “allow[ed] the ‘Princeton Mom’ to air her insulting views on rape?” Yet the wider world continues to see this woman dressed in orange and black associating her out-of-touch personal beliefs with our alma mater. We — along with many other alumni — see these views as outrageous and unworthy of being associated with Princeton. We ask the Princeton administration to continue its efforts to create a campus climate where all accusations of sexual assault are treated with the seriousness they deserve, and we invite those who share our views to raise their voices to join ours.

77573|~|Making rejection more acceptable|~|   February 5 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Over Intersession, I did not fly out to Cancun, explore the other side of the Atlantic, or even travel back home to Connecticut. I stayed on campus to prep for interviews. Scheduling several hours a day, I met up with friends to practice, went to the library, and read up on the infamous Case in Point. After hearing, time and time again, the tired trope about the importance of internships, I feared being that one junior who would enter the month of March with nothing to show for it, starting my career down the wrong path. After one failed interview and zero future ones on the horizon, that fear started to become more and more of an ugly reality. This article is not meant to be a pity party (although, I’ve never been opposed to a good party before). But it does suck; it sucks a lot. It’s hard not to view the rejection email (or worse, the dreaded lack of one long after your friends have already been accepted) as a rejection of yourself as a person. After all, isn’t a resume literally supposed to be a description of “you” on a piece of paper? When others are walking around campus in suits, heading to the Career Center or Dinky Train to New York, it is easy to fall into the mindset that you’re the only one being left behind, while everyone else is experiencing success. But we have to remember that’s not the case. At Princeton, it is easy to measure the metrics of success and failure on the accomplishments of others. Cherry-picking the positive stories, we view our own failures as the exceptions, rather than the norm. We have to remember that’s not true. Granted, it is easier said than done. Over-hearing the conversations of people going over finance terms or listening to their self-congratulatory discussion of how they successfully estimated annual gas consumption for a consulting case question, while prepping for a superday or second-round, it is easy to get annoyed or dejected about the internship process entirely. However, in these times, it is important to remember that we are more than just the piece of paper, brief phone call, or one-hour chat that we have been judged by. And this is not exclusive to jobs and internships. Whether it is bickering, auditioning for an acapella group, or trying to walk-on to a sports team, failure is never fun, and don’t let me try to convince you otherwise. With this week full of interviews and bicker, it is more prominent than usual. However, it is definitely a much more commonly occurring experience than we let ourselves think it is. That said, it does not mean we should pretend that everything with failure is perfectly okay. The worst thing we can do is to ignore our problems, tucking our failures into the emotional back pocket, never to be discussed again. We should talk about our failures, as much, if not more so, than our successes. Falling into the trap of blaming ourselves – running the hypotheticals through our head of “if only I had prepped that one extra day or been a little more social, then everything would be different” – is not only false, but also dangerous. Convincing ourselves that we are the sole problem places a mental limitation on ourselves, potentially making things worse. Princeton took a great step normalizing failure by launching the Princeton Perspective Project. Although the site was officially established last fall, I feel that, at this point of the year, it is especially important to bring it up again. The site contains videos and stories of fellow friends and classmates, all of whom have gone through hidden issues of their own, yet are viewed as accomplished people. Listening to the experiences of others, it becomes easier to realize that we are much more than our accomplishments (or our mistakes). In the end, we cannot change what happened. But we can learn from our experiences, preventing our past from holding back our future.|~|Ben Dinovelli is a Wilson School major from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu. 
77532|~|Editorial: Bicker reform|~|   February 5 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|This week, hundreds of sophomores participated in the annual spring Bicker process at the six selective eating clubs. One of the major problems plaguing Bicker is a lack of oversight, which creates difficulties for Bickerees who seek recourse when Bicker activities unduly harm or offend them. The Editorial Board accepts that eating clubs are institutions independent of the University and encourages each eating club to establish or strengthen internal accountability mechanisms. Without any system of accountability, Bicker clubs and their officers cannot take active measures to correct practices that make Bicker unnecessarily unpleasant for potential members. Though Bicker is imperfect, its dominance in Princeton social life necessitates a better system to improve the process for Bickerees and club members. The Board believes that clubs can do a better job of clearly outlining what sophomores can expect before the Bicker process and clearly state Bicker boundaries to their membership. Clubs could communicate expectations in the form of an online guide sent to Bickerees or verbal instructions before Bicker activities begin. The process could additionally benefit from an anonymous feedback system with which sophomores could report deviations from these expectations to club officers. The Board recognizes that each club has its own traditions and practices and encourages clubs to make sure that bicker activities do not deviate from approved practices due to poor oversight. A more transparent process would give club officers the information they need to prevent future transgressions. Often times, the line between what activities are allowed and what activities are discouraged is blurred and eating club members accidentally cross the line. With clearer instructions before Bicker begins and a better reporting mechanism, officers can become more aware of what lines may have been crossed so they can clarify guidelines with offending members. Making the system anonymous would improve the reporting rate, since sophomores would not fear reprisal for their reporting. Officers could easily ensure anonymity with a Google form or a similar platform. While a complaint could be traced back to its source, it would be incumbent on the officers to prevent this as much as possible. Additionally, any failings of the anonymous system would be outweighed by the overall improvement of the process. A high response rate would give clubs more opportunities to improve their Bicker activities, as well as determine the most pressing issues in their current processes. While some may contend that keeping complaints within the club would prevent any real change, the Board believes that an internal process is needed to account for differences between club traditions. Moreover, there does not exist an institution capable of providing effective or desired external oversight for the private clubs. The Board believes that the types of complaints that should be addressed are those that reflect deviations from officer and graduate board-approved bicker standards. Defining the baseline of acceptable behavior would give Bickerees a better idea of what to expect, as well as what activities would not be acceptable and should be reported to club officers. A more transparent delineation of Bicker boundaries would ensure that Bickerees understand the norms of the club to use as a baseline against their experiences during bicker. If clubs further institute an anonymous reporting system, they would be able to better prevent activities that fall outside of this norm. Bicker plays a large role in students’ lives, and it is the responsibility of the eating clubs to improve the system for present and future Bickerees.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief. 
77530|~|Recommendations for strengthening diversity at the graduate school and beyond|~|   February 5 2015|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Since we, concerned graduate students at Princeton University, published our last opposite editorial on the state of diversity in the Graduate School, there has been another unfortunate change to the administration. Diana H. Mitchell ’10 abruptly left her post as an Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs and Diversity during the middle of the academic year, not six months after her predecessor, Karen Y. Jackson-Weaver ’94. Typically the Office of Academic Affairs and Diversity manages several retention efforts for Princeton students from underrepresented backgrounds. The recent changes to the Office bring uncertainty to the fate of these crucial programs. These changes continue to raise concern, in both underrepresented minority graduate students and allies of diversity and inclusion. While we understand that the Graduate School’s current administration is in a state of transition, we cannot afford even a semester of stalled progress or — worse — backsliding. Even with a positive development like the organization of the Special Task Force on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion by the Council of the Princeton University Community, we need progress now. While we are aware that efforts like the Task Force on Diversity function to open discussion on the environment at Princeton, we want to ensure that the climate for underrepresented minority graduate students — whether enrolled or prospective — continues to improve. To that end, we offer the following recommendations for the University community to consider: We charge the Princeton community to help support these initiatives. Diversity is more than an issue for black and Latino graduate students; it impacts everyone. These issues affect people of various identities, including ability, class, faith, gender, nation, race, ethnicity and sexuality, and we also recognize that many black and Latino graduate students lie at the intersection of those identities. Our ultimate goal is to establish a campus where people are welcome regardless of the cultural and social groups either to which they belong or with which they identify. We charge the Princeton community with standing in solidarity and taking responsibility for the climate with us.

77396|~|On the usefulness of GirlCode|~|   February 4 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|After being on a swim team for all four years of high school, I’ve become accustomed to changing in the presence of teammates, both male and female. So when I walked into my hall bathroom the other day wearing nothing but my bath towel and confronted a girl using the men’s restroom, it was probably more embarrassing for her than it was for me. She apologized repeatedly and hurried out the door, but before she left, I heard enough of her rapid-fire explanation/simultaneous apology to understand that she had been locked out of the women’s restroom on account of the recent changes to the codes regulating the women’s restrooms. The issue regarding female restroom codes was brought to light in the weeks preceding winter break, when a group of three University students created an app aptly titled GirlCode. The application provided anyone with an iPhone the ability to access the codes for all restrooms in all campus dorms, but it was taken down after the creators were met with “pressure from the administration” due to alleged safety concerns. Following the removal of the application, most dormitories changed their codes over Intersession, leaving some girls stranded in their own halls. As a result, there has been a spate of debate about the role that bathroom codes should play on campus. This past November, then-USG president Shawon Jackson sent out a survey to gauge the student body’s opinion about bathroom codes. Since then, however, we have not received an official email response containing the outcomes of that survey (the closest thing we got was a statement by then-USG president-elect Ella Cheng in a Daily Princetonian article, which showed that of 1635 respondents, a 54.7 percent majority of participants voiced their preferences for no bathroom codes on either type of bathroom). Furthermore, the survey was woefully inadequate — it asked a simple multiple-choice question and didn’t account for response variability by gender, grade level, housing situation or other factors. Supposedly, in the recent meeting between the students responsible for the creation of the contentious application and the administration’s Office of Housing and Real Estate Services, Department of Public Safety, and the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students, the possibility of a policy change toward no bathroom codes in either type of bathroom may have surfaced. But again, since no student representatives (besides the creators of the app) were present at the meeting, such results are doubtful at best. Moreover, none of this changes the fact that the administration’s response to students’ needs has been much more reactionary than progressive. The issue has been up for debate for years, arising again semester after semester, but it wasn’t until this past November that an “official” survey was sent out by the USG to measure the student body’s opinion. However, even this attempt at obtaining a unified picture of popular sentiment, though undoubtedly well-intentioned, failed to provide an accurate representation or comprehensive results. It was only when the application was produced that the administration opted to take action — but instead of working to end the unpopular policy, it instead decided to abruptly change the codes for all female restrooms in the dormitories throughout campus. The University administration has been quite quick to respond to a variety of other perceived problems — they made rapid reforms earlier this academic year to address compliancy concerns with Title IX stipulations, created the Task Force on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and appointed provost David Lee to head the effort, repealed the contentious and widely-disliked policy of active grade deflation, and launched independent investigations when allegations of sexual assault and misconduct at eating clubs came to light — and their efforts should certainly be applauded. But they have undeniably fallen short on other concerns that they may perceive to be less important to the University’s overall public image — as is ostensibly the case regarding differences in gender-based restroom policies. Columnist Will Rivitz earlier this week agreed on the unpopularity of the policy, but attacked the application as an “ineffective, willfully ignorant, and conceited” method by which to enact change. But as the previous semester has shown, other “traditional” methods haven’t made any progress either. So in the end, was GirlCode the best way to approach the situation? Probably not. But was the University’s response to abruptly change female restroom codes over Intersession an adequate response? Again, probably not. Regardless, the application has succeeded in forcing the administration to pay attention to the issue, albeit in a disparaging way, but we can at least hope that they will proceed progressively from here on.|~|Jason Choe is a sophomore from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

77351|~|Enough with the term “microaggressions”|~|   February 4 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In a column published last month, Newby Parton ’18 described a running joke among his peers that he had considered a microaggression: the “spectacle” that peers made of his pronunciation of “wh.” He admitted to feeling ashamed of telling a friend that he thought so, but he’s technically right. That’s the problem. “Microaggressions” as defined by Columbia professor Derald Sue are “the everyday slights or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership,” which might seem like a bit of a stretch in Parton’s case. But Sue, who helped popularize the term first used in the ’70s, suggests that the victims of microaggression should be allowed to let us know when a phrase becomes an act of aggression. Under this definition, anyone can call any situation in which he or she is singled out by his or her identity a “microaggression,” so long as something about this identity is not the norm. A single quirk of regional speech is fair game. Parton’s point was that this scenario, while not particularly hurtful to him, made him realize how other individuals less “accustomed to microaggression” may unintentionally be hurt by comments made by others. Unsurprisingly, this nuance was completely lost by the outraged commenters and news sites that flocked to the scene of political correctness like vultures to a carcass. Before long the National Review joined the liberal-bashing fun. Parton’s argument that he is privileged as a white, heterosexual male and is rarely offended by offhand comments is sound, but his focus on the idea of microaggression is misplaced. The article and its reception highlight the problem with the term “microaggression” as a tool against problems like racism or sexism. It’s become over-used and vague, and is inadequate to accurately describe the experience of everyday oppression. Any term that can be used to describe a joke about the pronunciation of “wh” is too weak to describe this experience. It also happens to be exactly the kind of academic buzzword that makes anti-PC zealots foam at the mouth. There’s a simple solution: we specifically call out sexism or racism or classism, or whatever else we find truly problematic. When appropriate, why not just say something like “that’s demeaning to women” or “that’s a derogatory stereotype about Asian-Americans?” The term “microaggression” is completely unnecessary to convey that meaning. Ultimately, an effort like Tiger Microaggressions to report any and every perceived microaggression runs the risk of becoming a slightly more academic version of the golden rule. The biggest issue with the concept of the microaggression is that it is too malleable, which gives the “reverse-discrimination” crowd an easy comeback. An African-American exhausted by racial prejudice makes a comment that could be construed as a generalization about white people? Now that’s a microaggression. A frustrated feminist denounces patriarchal attitudes and offends some men’s rights activists? Microaggression! The focus on microaggression encourages the idea that oppression is just relative. It plays into the hands of the kind of people who think that the liberal persuasion of some universities is as oppressive as the white supremacy that throughout the nation’s history has subjugated and brutalized African-Americans. The reason, for example, that a casual remark that reflects derogatory attitudes towards blacks is different than one that reflects such attitudes towards whites is that the former is reflective of historical, societal and institutionalized prejudice rather than merely individual prejudice. The emphasis on subjective experience of microaggression allows many to overlook the objective, undeniable reality of forces like racism or sexism. That’s not to say that we shouldn’t discuss and debate what exactly constitutes societal oppression and how it may manifest itself in everyday situations. Discrimination is often ambiguous, and something like homophobia or racism is not static but fluid and constantly changing. Forms of oppression that were once entirely ignored should receive attention, such as transphobia. But it is clear oppression exists beyond the scope of individual experience and perception. We cannot ignore the legitimate concerns of individuals who fall outside the boxes of typically marginalized groups — for example, the struggles of Christian college students to maintain their identities in largely secular environments. In some cases, a strong regional accent can in fact lead to disadvantages. However, we need to keep in perspective the difference (not necessarily better or worse) between this type of situation and the experience of historical, societal oppression. The idea of microaggression makes no such distinction. For this reason, we need to retire its use as a catch-all term to publicly denounce the forces of discrimination. I realize that as a white, heterosexual, cisgender male I do not experience societal oppression, on a large or small scale. But when I see others go through this experience, I try as best I can to understand it for what it is, whether it be racism, sexism, homophobia, etc., rather than using the blanket label of “microaggression” and moving on. As allies, we should make a genuine effort to recognize the experience of everyday oppression not as a hot topic or social media trend but as a tangible reality for many of our friends and peers.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I.

77393|~|On hating the Daily Princetonian|~|   February 4 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|Something has been brewing inside my head for the past few months, and recently it’s come to a boil. Perhaps during my first few years on campus I was too oblivious to pick up on the pervasive disapproval of our school paper. Perhaps it is truly a new issue on campus. Indisputably, however, it has come to the forefront in recent months after coverage of recent issues regarding student arrests, sexual assault allegations and defensive editorials. I personally have nothing to do with the news section, or much at all to do with the ‘Prince’ itself for that matter. I simply write my modest opinions and hope somebody cares enough to comment or email. Still, having endured many similar attacks myself as well as witnessing the tireless work of my peers to make this paper, I found myself often siding with the Daily Princetonian on major disputes. A few months ago I wrote a column about the role emotions play in contentious issues and, more importantly, how they ultimately devalue the argument that a person is trying to make. I often find this to be the case whenever my peers discuss the paper, especially in the flame wars that have blown up in the comment threads on the ‘Prince’ website. This of course made it easier for me to dismiss the incessant criticism as senseless, ad hominem attacks, which I admit was unfairly self-righteous of me. Yet as much as I tried to remain emotionally neutral, I slowly became increasingly agitated with the anti-‘Prince’ movement, culminating with an astoundingly popular Facebook post in recent weeks by somebody I consider to be my friend. Invoking phrases such as “disgusted,” “embarrassed” and “gossip rag,” he relentlessly drilled the paper. While he did not mention specifics, I knew what he was referring to. Such vitriol was nothing new, but the most astounding thing to me was the sheer amount of support he received, garnering over 700 Facebook likes. It’s easy to fight back in the ‘Prince’ comment boards because just about everyone but myself comments anonymously. It’s very different when the criticism comes directly from friends. It hurts. It hurts an awful lot. So I lashed out in the best way I knew how. I ran to comment boards and Facebook and found the most hurtful comments. With my patience dry and my anger at critical mass, I wrote back. I replied with a sarcastic and dismissive tone, I insulted the commenters and I wrote in all capitals as if yelling gave any credence to my opinions. It showed I was mad, and that was all. But I’m glad this happened. In that moment, I glimpsed within myself the very same sort of emotional biases that I so publicly detest. Psychological bias is really a fascinating topic. Scientifically speaking, it exists in all of us. Yet, its very nature precludes our awareness of its influences on our own thoughts and actions. I never want to become the sort of close-minded, backward-thinking individual that presumes personal infallibility. With that said, I have to concede that if 700 of my friends and peers can openly support such overt censuring of our school paper, there has to be some level of legitimacy to the mistrust of this paper on this campus, which often manifests itself in heated and hurtful attacks. Always skeptical of my own opinions, I had a lengthy and informative discussion with some very close friends that certainly made me question decisions that the paper has made in the past. Without going into to extraneous detail, we covered everything from publishing names and Tiger Inn gossiping to mission statements and the objective value of reporting truth. The result was this: my opinions about many issues changed, but my respect for the paper, its staff, and its values did not. I’ve come to terms with the fact that the ‘Prince’ is not perfect.  While I don’t agree, I know many think it is downright awful. In light of my reflections, I don’t agree with many decisions the paper has made. But the ‘Prince’ is still our paper, run by our peers and in many cases, our closest friends. While its practices should always be under heavy scrutiny, the motives of its staff who work tirelessly to make it a reality should not. When I hear friends claim that the ‘Prince’ is a corrupt, psychopathic gossip rag aimed at bullying its fellow students and shaming the Princeton community, it honestly breaks my heart. These sort of misguided, emotional reactions do not lead to meaningful improvement of our paper. I encourage you all to read the letter from our new Editor-in-Chief Anna Mazarakis. She wonderfully lays out the motives of the ‘Prince.’ I promise you, from personal experience, she values your feedback and participation, as does the entire staff. They all want nothing more than to make the best paper they can make. So take the time to comment, email and participate, but know this. I’m willing to admit that my emotions have clouded my judgment at times. Now it’s your turn. Such hurtful, malicious or disrespectful criticisms will only turn away the very people who want to improve our paper and nothing will ever change.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a computer science major from Pittsburgh, Pa.

77196|~|Leadership and study abroad|~|   February 3 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|By the time we arrive on campus freshman fall, we’ve all been told that “the Senior Thesis is a defining aspect of the Princeton experience,” so much so that we just expect it will significantly affect our time here. We begin to understand the consequences the thesis has on the structure of our final year: most of us will only take three classes per semester senior year, and most clubs’ leadership terms are done by calendar year rather than academic year so that senior leaders’ terms end in the fall, allowing them to dedicate more time to the thesis. While I believe it’s important to allot sufficient time and energy to one’s thesis, and to make sacrifices in order to do so, I don’t think this necessarily means that clubs have to set leadership terms by calendar year just so no one is President during senior spring while finishing a thesis. This is not to say that no one can handle these two responsibilities simultaneously, but rather to point out that, to many individuals who may consider running for leadership, this is certainly a serious factor to consider. In most clubs now, across a variety of interests, leadership positions are often held by those elected as sophomores to serve during sophomore spring and junior fall, or by those elected as juniors to serve during junior spring and senior fall. I believe clubs should restructure leadership terms to be in line with the academic year rather than the calendar year. The solution is rather simple; most large clubs have some form of ‘junior officer’ or the equivalent (e.g. Social Media Chair, Recruitment Chair, etc.), roles traditionally held by second-semester freshmen or some sophomores. Thus, rather than leave second-semester juniors without options for staying active in their club, clubs can give these lower-level positions to sophomores for their full sophomore year, and juniors would serve in the senior leadership positions for their duration of their entire junior year as well. This also gives sophomores more time and a more natural pace to decide whether to study abroad junior year. There is a certain rhythm to each year where major things take up time and space such that we can’t often devote serious energy to planning that far ahead: moving in, settling into new classes, then all of a sudden it’s midterms, then Thanksgiving, then winter elections for many clubs. A similar rhythm exists in the spring. It would be better to have leadership elections at the beginning of the year (after pick-ups/new members have been welcomed by clubs). This leaves more unencumbered time open during the year, during which one can seriously consider things like study abroad. Having to choose between a leadership opportunity in an organization one is passionate about and study abroad is a major decision, one that requires serious reflection and can’t be made lightly. By realigning leadership terms, one can serve as a junior leader sophomore year, and still go abroad during the junior year if he or she should so chooses. And if one chooses to serve as a leader junior year, it won’t be with regret over not having studied abroad, because he or she will have had more opportunity for reflection and consultation before taking this decision. If terms were aligned with the academic year, leaders of student organizations would have a much greater degree of flexibility in determining when to study abroad. If a club has the goal of developing sophomore leaders, the sophomores could serve during their entire year and also be free during both semesters of junior year to study abroad if they choose to do so. If one chooses not to go abroad, one can serve in a more senior role, without that bleeding over into senior fall when the thesis process begins. This is better both for juniors and seniors, who can re-evaluate their priorities regarding leadership and studying abroad after each summer, and don’t need to worry about obligations carrying over to the next year. By better accommodating both leadership and study abroad into more students’ lives, Princeton can more fully live up to its stated goals of service and international exposure. This simple change can easily be affected across a wide variety of campus-wide organizations, as there would only be one adjustment year during which leadership terms would be shortened or lengthened. If we are truly to be a community of globally-minded students with an eye toward serving others, we need to encourage the development of both these faculties, rather than pitting one against the other.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

77217|~|The spirit of Kobani|~|   February 3 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|This week, we return to the Orange Bubble. Even those who did not leave Princeton over Intersession are returning to the familiar rhythm of problem sets and papers, applications and auditions, of immersion in ideas and academia. Halfway around the world though, another community is making a very different return. After months of fighting, against all odds, the people of Kobani — the Kurdish outpost in Syria against the Islamic State — have driven the black flags of the Islamic State from their city. They return, not to a bubble, but rather to the rubble of homes, dreams and lives. As we face classes and Bicker, these Kurds face violent extremists, starvation and apathy — but rebuild, hopeful in spite of it all. Do not ignore the fragile hope of this far-off land — let it discomfort and inspire you, and lift your isolation. What happens when the homeland you fight for is gone? How do you carry forward, against impossible odds and reckless evil, when that evil has already destroyed everything you ever knew or lived for? This is the spirit of Kobani. Perhaps because they have been used to decades of existential threats in Turkey, Iraq and Syria, the Kurds have shown incredible resolve against the Islamic State. Where the Islamic State had modern heavy weapons stolen from the U.S.-supplied Iraqi army and Syrian revolutionaries, the defenders had ancient AK-47 rifles and trucks rigged with pipes and metal plates. Where the extremists had ransom, oil and drug money, the Kurds had reluctant support from a remote and fickle United States, and the obstruction and enmity of Turkey, on whose doorstep the battle raged. And yet, outnumbered, face-to-face with the epitome of modern evil, they struggled forward. The ever-persecuted, defending their homes and families, beat back an army of hate and despair. At Kobani, a wave of darkness broke on their iron-clad resolve, and receded. The defenders celebrated the liberation of a city which has, quite simply, ceased to exist. Hundreds of thousands of refugees from the city and its surrounding villages were forced to leave livestock and vehicles behind as they fled into Turkey. Half the city was flattened. We can certainly never repay our debt to this people who have sacrificed their city to stop a tide of hate focused against American ideology, and we will likely fall short of even a worthy attempt. The Kurds proved to the world that this false caliphate — the enemy of our ideals — could be defeated, and for what? Whole villages are starving in Turkish camps or in the dust of their homes. Turkey, a U.S. ally, continues to prevent people and aid from crossing the border, while suppressing protests against the blockade with tear gas, water cannons and, allegedly, live ammunition. The Kurds will likely continue, stateless, a pawn of U.S. realpolitik. This is your world’s gratitude for extremism’s foes. Does this make you uncomfortable? Is this an inconvenient intrusion into your Princeton schedule and social life? Good. Embrace it. Isolation has never been acceptable. We cannot claim to study in the service of all nations while passively watching global struggles against hate and subjugation. In Kobani, Nigeria and Eastern Ukraine, but also in cities across the country — even a train-ride away from campus — hate and despair live on. Discrimination does not always wave a black flag, but its spread is no less insidious — in the classroom, job market or poll lines. Hatred doesn’t always wield guns and tanks — it lives in harsh words, harsh policies or broken friendships. Dogmatism need not behead — sometimes, it can be found in our refusal to entertain uncomfortable ideas in the classroom or legislature. Maybe you are lucky enough to have the resources or political capital to help rebuild Kobani, or to reverse decades of injustice in Kurdistan. If not, do not turn away from the good fight. Your survival and home likely do not depend upon it, but that is no reason not to struggle forward. Root out evil in every form — whether you find it in institutional injustice, or in your own callous or simply thoughtless acts. This struggle goes beyond the quintessential struggle bus. This is constant striving, with every fiber of our being, to make ourselves, our community and our world the best they can possibly be. This, too, is the spirit of Kobani.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a chemistry major from Littleton, Colo. He can be reached at bam2@princeton.edu.

77211|~|The universal right to bathrooms|~|   February 3 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|There has been a lot of talk recently about GirlCode, and the ramifications it has caused on campus. GirlCode was an app, created by three University freshmen, which aggregated all the campus bathroom codes onto one easily accessible app. The app was available for anyone to download on their phones, including people who are unaffiliated with the University. Because of the security risk posed by this disclosure, the University proceeded to change all the bathroom codes on all the women’s bathrooms around campus. So far, the focus of this issue has been on the very important topics of the fairness of a gender-based bathroom system and the ways in which students can try and effect change in their colleges. A recent column in the ‘Prince’ addressed this issue, but focused on the app itself and the intentions behind it. GirlCode was created as a sort of protest against the much-discussed University policy decision to have codes for all women’s bathrooms. Will Rivitz argued that the creators of GirlCode made a mistake by bypassing the established structure for suggesting changes in University policy. I think the more immediate problem is the botched way in which the University handled its reaction to the app. The response has been extremely inconvenient to female students and reflects a lack of transparency on important issues of student life. Regardless of whether or not the creators of GirlCode were right to create the app, or justifiable in their attempt to change the system, the larger issue is that of the University’s response. The bathroom codes were changed unexpectedly over Intersession, and the new codes were not promptly or adequately distributed to female students as soon as the change took place. The actual action of distributing the codes was left to residential college advisers, who were also on break like everyone else when the code change occurred. As a result, many RCAs failed to promptly distribute the codes, but this doesn’t change the fact that the responsibility to make sure every female student gets the necessary codes still fundamentally lies with the University. People involved in the administration, such as those affiliated with the residential colleges, should have made sure that the RCAs followed the instructions to distribute the new codes. Additionally, administrative staff could have easily implemented a transition period, during which they could have sent an email informing all relevant students that the codes were going to be changed and that their RCAs would have the new codes. Then, even if an RCA was neglectful, the members of their zee group could still take the initiative and contact them. The point is, they would have known where to go to get this vital information. The impact of this inadequate preparation was immediate and completely ridiculous. Many female students woke up one day and found that they suddenly did not have access to bathrooms in their buildings. I understand that the University was probably trying to minimize the number of affected students by changing the codes over a school break, but they apparently didn’t take into account that many students do in fact stay in the dorms over Intersession. Additionally, many University trips returned early that week. Transparency in larger University issues is a must, especially when they affect so important and personal an issue. We can argue over whether the University should have changed the codes or not, or whether the codes should exist or not, but in any case, the University should have never stranded its female students without bathrooms to use in their own dorms.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va.

77053|~|Princetonian exceptionalism and attitudes toward sexual assault|~|   February 2 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|I’d like to think that most people at the University know and care about the recent trial in Tennessee, in which two former Vanderbilt University students were convicted of the gang rape of a fellow student. (Two additional former students are awaiting trial for the same incident.) After all, despite being states away, we too have recognized that sexual assault is a problem on campus, as evidenced by the reforms adopted by the administration this past fall that sought to improve the school’s ability to respond adequately to such crimes in accordance with Title IX obligations. However, I fear that Princeton students, like those at other universities around the United States, tend to ignore and dismiss these problems that don’t directly involve them. Unfortunately that blissful ignorance, highlighted by the attitudes of Vanderbilt students toward this horrific rape case, seems to exist here, there and all around, perpetuating the existing rape culture and preventing fundamental change. The Vanderbilt case involved four football players who took turns assaulting an unconscious classmate, whom they then dragged into a dorm room while other students watched but failed to intercede or report a problem. The assailants even documented their attack by taking video and pictures. Many bystanders were aware of the assault as it occurred, and more knew of the attack in its aftermath, but all of them failed to do anything about it. Rather, the defense of one assailant was that he was too drunk to remember and that the partying atmosphere on campus contributed to his actions. The Vanderbilt Hustler, Vanderbilt’s student newspaper, found that two weeks ago, right before the trial commenced, “many students were not even aware of it.” More telling, however, as The New York Times noted, was that most Vanderbilt students appeared to take one of two polar opposite attitudes towards the situation: either that Vanderbilt “is not the sort of place where such things happen” or “they happen everywhere — and either way, no one should point a finger at Vanderbilt.” Apparently, students “find it hard to square what happened with their views of this elite university as an oasis from a harder world.” Both of these attitudes are extremely problematic. First, to suggest that these issues don’t exist at an elite institution such as Vanderbilt (or just about any other university in the United States) is more than just an ignorant perspective; it is dangerous because it can encourage active denunciation of rape victims’ claims and facilitate bystander inaction. Regardless of which statistic you believe is an accurate representation of the prevalence of sexual assault and rape on campuses, it is clearly widespread, and universities must be proactive in confronting the issue. The second viewpoint is just as troubling. Even though it at least recognizes the existence of sexual assault as prevalent and problematic, it uses its pervasiveness as an excuse to avoid addressing the issue, rather than as a call for massive change around the country. An understanding that no university is immune to these problems is important; just because sexual assault hasn’t been covered in the local or national news does not mean it is not an issue. And with cases of sexual assault, these low public numbers are usually more troubling, since they reflect a culture of underreporting. However, this understanding is not enough unless it translates into a call for change everywhere. And unfortunately, as the Vanderbilt case shows, it typically doesn’t. I don’t think Vanderbilt is unique in this way. When allegations of sexual misconduct at Tiger Inn came to light this past fall, many students on campus treated the issue superficially, dismissing what happened as a non-issue. And when people did take a strong stance in response by graffitiing the TI premises, their actions were almost always criticized. Although admittedly this was because that person resorted to vandalism rather than trying to promote structural change within the system, it seemed that few people were willing to even discuss the problems of rape culture that this response was highlighting. The entire controversy was short-lived, downplayed and not particularly widespread. People try to protect their university’s reputation, rather than accept the fact that their school, like all others, is imperfect and would benefit from certain changes. Perhaps this is because the students’ own reputations are tied up in the school’s image; to much of society the school is a representative of each student, and vice versa. And while such a generalization is wrong to begin with, it is even more problematic when it is used to excuse or belittle serious problems that exist on campus. If University students don’t think that sexual assault is happening here, then they are sorely mistaken and turning a blind eye. While it might be easier to pretend that these crimes don’t happen here, or that when they do, they are isolated cases, this is simply not true. Those who use the prevalence of these felonies as an excuse for inaction are also taking away the wrong message. These attitudes are not conducive to inspiring massive cultural changes, both at the University and nationally, which is what is really necessary to curb the occurrences of sexual assault and to push society to better respond to cases. Vanderbilt is not an exception when it comes to sexual assault. The University is not an exception when it comes to sexual assault. Neither of these realities means it’s an acceptable excuse to sit back and let sexual assault happen.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu.

77062|~|Meaning in Pre-read and why it matters|~|   February 2 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|There are over 129 million different books, according to engineers for the Google Books project. That’s so many books! If you read one book an hour without sleep, it would take you 15,000 years to finish them all. But a super reliable source (Wikipedia) tells me that approximately two million new titles are published each year, so you would need to read 228 books every hour just to keep up. I can’t read that fast. Not even University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 can read that fast, and he has superpowers. No one should blame Eisgruber, then, if he does not choose the perfect book for Princeton Pre-read. He has other presidential duties and can’t spend all his hours book-picking. It’s a wonder he finds time to book-pick at all. But he does. The Class of 2018 got bubble-wrapped copies of “Meaning in Life and Why It Matters” by Susan Wolf GS ’78 when we were little pre-frosh. “I hope that it will introduce the freshmen to the kinds of scholarship they will encounter at Princeton,” Eisgruber said of the Pre-read program. Wolf’s book was well-suited for this. More philosophical than practical, it reads a lot like a dissertation. She defines terms like “subjective” and “objective” worth and asserts that goldfish-gazing is not a meaningful way to spend our lives. (Shucks.) Her 63-page argument is followed by 70 pages of critical comments, which teach the conventions of academic dialogue. As a work of philosophy, “Meaning in Life” is probably really good, which I can say with authority because I took one philosophy class when I was 15 years old. However, I don’t think that “Meaning in Life” was as great a pick for non-philosophers. Wolf did not imagine that her audience would be 18-year-olds bombarded with the distractions of summer. She especially did not imagine that she would have to compete against bubble wrap for her reader’s attention. I, for one, do not have a heart stony enough to choose highbrow books over bubbles. I am not alone. According to a deeply scientific survey that I conducted within my zee group, more than half of freshmen did not read the entire book. Among participants who did, not one said it was useful to them. This is so sad! Libraries are filled with useful books, and even though we will never find the perfect one, we should still try to find a book that will move people, help people or change their lives somehow. The summer before college is a critical time for us. We are still impressionable. Work and stress do not constrain us. The books admitted students read will influence the way they think forever, and Eisgruber must consider this when selecting a book for Pre-read. Maybe this year he will pick “The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank, “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” by Maya Angelou or “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. Or a biography of Benjamin Franklin, or a book about time management or “We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families” by Philip Gourevitch a first-hand chronicle of the genocide in Rwanda. These books are readable, and they can favorably shape or change the way a person acts and thinks.  Of course, my proposals are imperfect because I cannot read 228 books an hour. Someone who reads more than I do can suggest better books. Eisgruber himself is better read than I will ever be, so I am trusting him to pick a good book for the Class of 2019. When picking, I hope he will keep in mind the audience and where they are in their lives. “Meaning in Life” was a treat for academics, but admitted students are not academics yet. They are children. Erudite treatises will put them to sleep. I understand the desire to introduce us to scholarship early, but have faith in the University. Our professors and our curriculum will do the introducing soon enough. Instead, let’s give the Class of 2019 something engaging and inspiring — a book they’ll want to read and which will move them more than the magic of bubble wrap.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn.

77060|~|The first semester|~|   February 2 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Matthew Choi Taitano|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|My mom cried when I showed her that I had a bed of my own in my dorm room. She cried because I spent almost my entire life sleeping on either the floor or the living room couch. She said, “God has blessed my baby with a bed of his own.” I didn’t think much of it at the time, until I woke up from my first night at Princeton and felt more rejuvenated than ever. The dull ache in my back to which I had become accustomed wasn’t there anymore. I ran my hands across my bed sheets and felt a newfound sense of ownership. These were my sheets, and this was my bed. I began to feel very sentimental and gave a short prayer of thanks to God for affording me this opportunity, at the number one university in the United States. I was excited to tackle my first semester at Princeton and to be exposed to the academic richness that the University had to offer. This excitement began to dwindle as the semester went on. Instead of being intrigued by the work from my classes, I felt anxious about what I needed to remember for my quizzes and exams in order to get good grades. I was always comparing myself to other people who seemed to handle the workload much better than I did. I felt intimidated by those who said that their high schools prepared them well enough for some of the classes that they were taking at Princeton. My high school was ranked one of the worst schools in Guam, so I didn’t have the resources that I needed to prepare myself for college. Moreover, as a first generation college student, my parents didn’t have the abilities to advise me on what I needed to do in order to succeed in college. The first semester of college is difficult for all students, but it tends to be more difficult for low-income first generation students. Many students here feel the pressure to succeed because their parents expect them to. However, many low-income first generations feel the pressure to succeed because their parents need them to. In fact, many of them have worked hard throughout high school to attend a school as prestigious as the University so that they can provide a better life for their parents and siblings. This creates more pressure for these students because they might feel that their failures will have negative repercussions not only on themselves, but also on their families. When I went back home for winter break, I was reminded why I worked so hard in high school to get into a school like Princeton. Revisiting the poor conditions in which my family and many others in Guam continue to live after being exposed to the abundance of resources offered at the University made me recall the ambition and motivation I had as a high school student to succeed. At first, I thought this was a feeling specific to me; however, after talking to my friends about our breaks when we came back to campus, I discovered that many of them felt the same way. One of my friends said that when he went back home, he remembered that he was poor— the exact same thought that I had. One of the reasons that low-income first generation students have a difficult time during their first semesters, and even throughout all of college, is that they feel as though they are not good enough. Also, they might feel that their success in college will not be enough to provide for their family. They might think, “Well, my family has been poor my entire life. How is my success in college going to change that?” This belief that the rich remain rich and the poor remain poor creates an environment in which those who have been subjected to poor conditions are almost dissuaded to better their lives. However, we, as Princeton students, must remember the power a Princeton degree holds. As pretentious as it may sound, Princeton has an alumni network that traces back to some of the most powerful people in history. We cannot let others, and especially ourselves, get in our way. Moreover, we must not doubt the reasons we were accepted to the University. Many people might believe that students like myself got in because of where we came from and that the poor conditions in which we have lived might have made us seem more “interesting.” Low-income first generation students must realize that they are more than their socio-economic status. We deserve to be here as much as any other person on this campus, and we should not feel discouraged when concepts do not come to us as quickly as those who went to better schools than we did. Instead, we should use this fact as motivation to work harder and to showcase our capability to succeed despite the conditions in which we have grown up.|~|Matthew Choi Taitano is a freshman from Yigo, Guam.

76945|~|Letter from the Editor|~|   February 1 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Anna Mazarakis|~|   Editor-in-Chief     |~|Community is a big deal at Princeton. From the proud alumni who flock back to campus each June for Reunions to the thousands of enthusiastic students at athletic events, to the townies and tourists who stroll through campus and attend our events, Princeton is not complete without the community that surrounds it. Despite coming from around the world and having varied backgrounds and interests, we all contribute to our Princeton community, even if we do so in different ways. Princeton would not be what it is today without the numerous academics, activists, actors, artists and athletes. Among these roles is that of the archivist, which is where The Daily Princetonian comes in. The ‘Prince’ has informed the community consistently since it was founded in 1876 and has preserved the history of what has happened here. Every Sunday through Thursday from 4:30 p.m. to the early hours of the morning, editors and staffers are at work in our newsroom editing articles and photographs and laying out the paper. This follows work throughout the day outside the newsroom by our hardworking staff coordinating content, conducting interviews, taking photographs, writing articles, listening and paying attention to what is happening in the community. Community is important to the ‘Prince’ too. We work hard because we want to keep you informed, whether you reside within FitzRandolph Gate or outside it. We are a student newspaper in a university community, so our mission of sharing the news here is pretty simple. Regardless of whether it is “good” news or “bad” news, if you’re talking about it or if we think you will be talking about it, we want to give you the facts of what happened as well as what is being said so you can form your own opinion. This may sound like a strange way of introducing the first issue of the 139th Managing Board of the ‘Prince.’ However, as the new Editor-in-Chief, I think it is sometimes easy to forget how the newspaper fits into our Princeton community and what goes into producing the paper that you read in the dining hall at breakfast or online during lectures. We want you to know that we plan to work constructively with you over the course of the next year. We want to improve communications between the paper and the community, and we want to represent your voice in this paper. This newspaper cannot operate in a vacuum; we are nothing without you, the Princeton community. If you are frustrated or inspired by the content of one of our articles, I encourage you to leave a comment on our website or write a letter to the editor that we can publish in our paper. We want to hear what you think and start a conversation on campus, so don’t be shy! If you hear or see something interesting that could be newsworthy, I encourage you to send an email to tips@dailyprincetonian.com. Your tip could turn into a story that could start a conversation on campus or even around the world, thanks to our alumni readers outside of the Orange Bubble. And if you want to contribute even more, then I encourage you to join us as part of our staff. Feel free to come to one of our open houses next week, or go to dailyprincetonian.com/join to learn more about how you can get involved with the ‘Prince.’ From reporters to photographers, coders to copy editors, layout designers to bloggers, there is a place for everyone at our paper and we would love to have you. I’m really excited to lead this newspaper for the next year and I’m looking forward to interacting with the entire Princeton community. I’m committed to making this newspaper the best it can be in the next year, so I hope you’re just as excited for the next year of news as I am.|~|

76949|~|Princeton Dreams|~|   February 1 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Paul Chin ’06 Last spring, I skipped Reunions and attended a different kind of celebration. I had been looking forward to it for a while — six years to be exact. It was the day the first group of students I had ever taught would walk the stage for their high school graduation. As I watched them snap selfies and snag congratulatory embraces, my thoughts turned to Princeton. These kids were off to do great things; many would be the first college freshmen in their families. I had met them as middle schoolers at a charter school in south central Los Angeles. Now, some were headed to colleges like Johns Hopkins and UCLA. As I marveled at what they had accomplished, I wondered what more we Tigers could do to make moments like this possible for more low-income students in this country. Nine years ago, I began my career as an educator. With a handful of other Princeton classmates, I joined Teach For America. I wrote my JP and senior thesis on the types of challenges schools face and how certain schools are approaching these challenges differently compared to traditional public schools. I was intent on translating the theories I had studied into practice. My parents, members of the Class of 1975, were supportive, but they had both been trained as attorneys and there was never a shortage of suggestions regarding law school as a career path instead. That all changed when they came to visit me and my students in LA. They spent the day with us and saw the impact I was having firsthand. Since then, they have asked me about law school exactly zero times. Instead, they have talked me through countless tough moments, come to speak to my students across three states and have become the fiercest pair of advocates for the value of my work and the potential of my kids that a teacher could hope for. All of which brings me back to my central question: can we as Princetonians do anything more to ensure that all students in this country have the opportunity to receive a quality education and attend a university like Princeton? I believe that we can. We need more outstanding educators on the front lines of our neediest schools. Currently, there are far too few Tigers in our ranks. Imagine the impact an elite team of Princeton graduates could have on our schools across the nation. The good news is that the University is already making an effort. This fall, the administration announced several initiatives designed to increase the presence of low-income students on campus, such as expanding the Freshman Scholars Institute, a program that supports incoming freshmen who may be the first in their families to go to college or who have come from schools that did not offer advanced placement courses. Princeton is also improving initiatives to identify and recruit first-generation students in general. This is essential, invaluable work: not enough low-income students even see Princeton as an option. However, such efforts address only a tiny piece of the problem. Currently, our public education system prepares a shamefully small sliver of students from communities like the ones I’ve worked in — south central Los Angeles, Newark, and Eastside Indianapolis — for the rigors of a college like ours.  As Princetonians, we can be a part of changing this. However, this requires an unpopular and financially difficult career choice. An Ivy League education can open doors on Wall Street, and there is a certain prestige associated with moving on from a place like Princeton to a top-tier law school or business school. Far less prestige is associated with a career in education. Nevertheless, this is the field that most directly determines our nation’s future. Some countries recognize this. Finland and South Korea consistently outperform the United States on international exams. In these countries, educators are revered and their students excel. Attitudes are different in this country. Teaching is not for everyone. For those who are interested in teaching but are not quite certain that they are ready to take the leap, two-year programs like Teach for America offer exclusive scholarships and benefits, partnering with top employers like Google Inc. and JP Morgan Chase and graduate schools like Harvard Law School and Johns Hopkins. I honestly wasn’t sure it was for me; then, I met my kids. Nearly a decade later, as I prepare to become a principal, I know I made the right choice for myself, and I am writing this piece now to encourage more Princetonians to give teaching a chance and work to open the doors of institutions like ours to kids who might otherwise never consider it. When I advise my students about college, I want to be able to tell stories of students like them who have attended Princeton and excelled. I want to be able to tell them just how much Princeton has done, and is doing, to make all that possible.|~|Paul Chin ’06 is an Instructional Leadership Fellow at Uncommon Schools and a 2006 alum of Teach For America.

76951|~|The willful blindness of GirlCode|~|   February 1 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|GirlCode was a bad idea. For readers who missed the extensive coverage, on Jan. 7, three University freshmen released GirlCode, a mobile app containing the codes required to get into every Princeton women’s bathroom. Their message was simple: to spark a campus debate about the “archaic gender norms that Princeton” imposes with women’s bathroom codes. Shortly after, University representatives “force[d],” in the words of Amanda Shi ’18, one of the app’s creators, the students to take down the app a few days later. The bathroom codes were changed without warning several days later, leaving most of the female students on campus without bathroom access for two days. Granted, this isn’t the first time female bathroom codes have been brought up. From former columnist Luke Massa in 2011, who referred to bathroom codes as a “relic,” to current columnist Logan Sander, who raised privacy concerns for men, bathroom codes have been a hotly debated topic. For what it’s worth, I tend to agree with the large portion of the student body here who think that codes are unnecessary for ensuring that the campus remains safe. Most of my female friends on campus have expressed frustration with the code system, angry that it only applies to women on campus. Many have used men’s bathrooms to shower or use the toilet when unable to access the nearby women’s bathroom. Some forward emails containing every bathroom code to friends who have complained about this lack of access. However, all this app has done is ignore the already-existing debate. Yes, it’s clear that, for many students, bathroom codes are an unpleasant issue, unfortunate relics of bygone days which they would like to eliminate. We know this precisely because of this discussion, discussion which not only already exists, but has been prominent the entire semester. So when the app’s creators say that GirlCode was intended to “spark much needed dialogue on campus,” they grossly misrepresent the state of the campus. Officially, University administrators and the Undergraduate Student Government (and, unofficially, almost every student on campus) have already conducted conversations, and will continue to do so until a resolution is reached. Ignoring the current dialogue wholly undermines the seemingly noble mission of GirlCode and the entire point of its existence. The USG’s bathroom code survey — sent, mind you, over two months before the launch of GirlCode — speaks to how public this discussion has been over the three creators’ entire Princeton careers. That USG survey brings up what I interpret to be the most important problem with GirlCode’s creation: it entirely circumvents the governmental process of creating meaningful change which has proven support from at least a majority of voters or legislators. Bathroom codes are an important issue on the USG agenda, and this past semester we saw it treated as such, and it seems as though we are moving towards a legitimately sanctioned resolution. GirlCode totally avoids any form of the due process we’ve come to expect from our USG. Three students — students who have been on campus for approximately four months — should not endeavor to speak for thousands of students who have been discussing this issue for months, if not years, in an attempt to change the status quo. Frankly, it is misguided and obstinate to supersede an entire system of government and its processes, especially one as effective as our USG. No amount of diverting the conversation to the topic of gender inequality will change that. However, despite its numerous flaws, GirlCode does bring up a good point. Three freshmen rendered null an entire security system. It is possible that two or three years down the line, more freshmen — ones who don’t know about GirlCode — will do the same. This seems to suggest flaws in the current system. Moreover, meaningful change seems like it would be relatively easy to enact. For instance, bathroom codes could be totally removed, or codes could be added to men’s bathrooms as well. I’d like to propose a third solution: if the locks are to stay, make them prox-based and give all girls prox access. Though the mechanics behind the prox system are a mystery to me, I assume it would be possible to give about half the proxes on campus the ability to open these doors, and given that almost all students carry their prox with them everywhere, this proposal would balance both safety and convenience. Now that the GirlCode incident has died down, one thing we know remains: the bathroom codes, by and large, are highly unpopular. The recent unannounced code change (likely due to GirlCode’s existence) locked many female students on campus out of their bathrooms, and there was a palpable sense of anger when the new codes took almost two days to appear in students’ inboxes after changing. I wholly support a reform of the bathrooms: a reform carefully debated by our current campus and one on which all students — not just three — can vote. The inefficacy, willful ignorance and conceit of GirlCode’s implementation is not the way to achieve the meaningful change we seek.|~|
76714|~|Letter from the Editor |~|   January 11 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marcelo Rochabrun|~|   Editor-in-Chief Emeritus     |~|It’s hard being a student journalist at Princeton these days. I started my tenure as Editor-in-Chief a year ago discussing the University’s massive communications efforts to craft an ever-positive image of itself. I wrote then about the University’s SPIN program (initials which officially don’t stand for anything, I was later told), that groups over 150 administrators to discuss communications strategies, and I stressed that the purpose of The Daily Princetonian was to deconstruct spin and to present the news without an agenda. At the beginning of my tenure I promised to take a more aggressive approach to our reporting and to stress daily the differences between the University’s propaganda machine and an independent news organization. A year later, I have been surprised by the retaliation some of our writers have had to face not from angry administrators but from their peers, other students who did not appreciate stories that negatively portrayed certain aspects of student life on campus. While these consequences were mainly social — being banned from an eating club or being asked to leave a small dorm party, for example — others were serious yet highly improbable, such as threats of bodily harm or a conspiracy to plant drugs in the newsroom (I kid you not, I overheard the latter one day while walking to our newsroom at 48 University Place). We didn’t take any of this personally or seriously, of course. We are well aware that our job descriptions require us to write and actively pursue unpopular stories that will bring to light questionable behavior or wrongdoing. However, I was taken aback that most of the pushback against the paper this year came from other students rather than from the administration. As student journalists we deal each day with living among the small community that makes up the Princeton student body while reporting on it at the same time. As a result, it is inevitable that student journalists and story subjects will cross paths among multiple spheres of life on campus. Professional journalists don’t face these encounters as often, nor do they have to reconcile their affiliations with their town, city or country with the work they do in the same way that we have to reconcile our affiliations with Princeton and the ‘Prince.’ Yet, the ‘Prince’ has in the undergraduate student body its most contentious critics, the same broad group of people who make up our staff. A vocal minority of the student body has come to expect a paper that, if it does not properly advocate for the interest of the students, at least presents a semblance of solidarity with its peers. In short, that we play nice when we discuss one of our own. One particular comment on a recent arrest story was symptomatic of this thinking, a student wrote: “It’s amazing to see student publications more concerned with disgracing their student body than actually publishing thought provoking news.” Here at the ‘Prince,’ our reporters try to be journalists first, students second. Our stories are not attacks against our peers or attempts to disgrace them, but an attempt to provide prompt, relevant information to the University community even when the content of our stories may afflict some of our readers, such as those who are personally close to the story, those who feel we ought not to tarnish Princeton’s reputation or those who will not be portrayed in a positive light. In addition, we treat all of our sources like who they are: adults. We have no deference to our peers and we have no deference to administrators. In fact, writing stories about the administration —  where the extra layers separating us from our Nassau Hall sources mean our relationships never have to transcend the professional — can sometimes be easier because there is a clear distinction between our journalism and our personal lives. However, it’s not that we have shied away from negative stories about the administration, our coverage of the University’s mental health policies comes to mind, for example. Just like we do not have an agenda with the administration, we do not have an agenda when we report on matters of student life. Nevertheless, having reached the end of my term, I want to remind you that before you take it out on a reporter for a story you have read, remember that the only person responsible for everything published in the ‘Prince’ this year was me.|~| Marcelo Rochabrun, a history major from Lima, Peru, is the outgoing Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Princetonian.

76636|~|Editorial: Facilitating professor-student and town-gown connections|~|   January 11 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The University’s focus on undergraduate education as well as its small-town setting set it apart from its peer institutions. In the spirit of promoting this undergraduate-focused experience, the University urges students and faculty alike to engage in fruitful dialogue outside the classroom and to build lifelong academic and professional relationships. At this year’s Opening Exercises, University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 described the University as small enough that students should get to know their professors on a more personal level. Eisgruber is correct in noting that the same undergraduate focus that motivated students to enroll at the University has drawn faculty members to teach at this institution as well. Likewise, many who choose to reside in Princeton are likely drawn to the University’s contribution to the town. However, there still is more that can be done to break down the barrier that students feel between themselves and their extremely well-versed, well-educated and well-known professors, and those living beyond the FitzRandolph Gate. One solution to bridge the student-faculty divide would be for the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students and the Office of the Dean of Faculty to jointly facilitate a program in which faculty could sign up to befriend a student. The pair would meet on a regular but non-time-constraining basis throughout the academic year. Six hours a year would be a fair commitment level to propose. In order to distinguish this relationship from that between a student and an academic adviser, mentors would be encouraged to invite students to engage in conversation outside of the University, promoting dialogue on topics such as internships, research, how they found themselves in academia, as well as events going on within the University community and the world. The relationship would be one of a professional acquaintanceship, with administration encouraged to remain professional but informal. University students are young adults on the brink of the real world and everything that comes along with it. Faculty should feel comfortable associating with students as mental equals. Students and faculty would both sign up for the program voluntarily and be matched based on similar academic and extracurricular interests. For instance, a student in the comparative literature department with an interest in astronomy and gardening might be matched with an astrophysics professor with a large and plentiful tomato garden in need of some assistance this spring. Granted, the connection may be on another level, such as a common favorite sports team or author, allowing students to hear perspectives from faculty members with whom they normally would not take classes. This program could even be extended to students fostering relationships with members outside the University. Too often students forget that the University is a part of the larger Princeton community, with far more fathers, mothers, children, high school students, police, local-business owners and local politicians than Panera Bread and J.Crew. In a similar fashion to the student-faculty bonding program, the University could invest in a program in which students are paired with families within the community of a similar ethnic or religious background, if they so desired. The partnership could even be established on criteria such as a similar professional interest. In this voluntary commitment, a Jewish family might take in a Jewish student or two around Hanukkah or Yom Kippur. The family could even take in a student who has a strong interest in Judaism and is open to different cultures. Many Princetonians go home only once a year, or even less frequently due to financial or travel restrictions. The opportunity to spend time with a family right outside of FitzRandolph Gate would allow students who may feel lonely during their time at the University or who are simply in need of a break from the stress of schoolwork to perhaps bond with a young student in the community who may have never met a Princetonian before, despite living five blocks away from 5,000 of them. Overall, these two initiatives would not only continue to foster the University spirit of an undergraduate-focused education, but they would also strengthen the relationship that students have with faculty members and improve the relationship between the University and Princeton community as a whole. Therefore, the Editorial Board strongly encourages the University to facilitate student-faculty and student-community member bonding programs in the near future.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief. 
76673|~|We cannot be guilty of oversimplification |~|   January 11 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I believe in unconditional freedom of speech and I condemn the attack on the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, that occurred in Paris. However, I am disturbed nonetheless by the oversimplification of Islam and portrayal of terrorism that I have noticed on both social media platforms and the news. #JeSuisCharlie has become a trope to defend freedom of speech. However, this trope seems to confuse supporting Charlie Hebdo’s freedom of speech and supporting the views presented by the satirical magazine. “I do not agree with what you have to say, but I’ll defend to the death your right to say it,” a quote attributed to Voltaire, was well said. We need to differentiate between agreeing with Charlie Hebdo and supporting its right to say whatever it pleases. As David Brooks points out in his New York Times column, most of us are not Charlie Hebdo in the sense that “most of us don’t actually engage in the sort of deliberately offensive humor that that newspaper specializes in.” One thing that people seem to often neglect in this discussion is that Charlie Hebdo was offensive. There’s no denying it. Perhaps the public has had limited exposure to the actual content of Charlie Hebdo, since major publications such as the Times and NPR decided against publishing the original content. However, a quick Google image search reveals crude — and not particularly funny — cartoons depicting a naked Prophet Muhammad discussing his buttocks. I — and I suspect many of us — am not a fan of such offensive jokes. We should embrace Charlie Hebdo’s position in society, as opposed to claiming that we ourselves are Charlie Hebdo. More disturbingly, columnists such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali have been guilty of oversimplifying Islam and mistaking it as inherently violent. Ayaan Hirsi Ali wrote in her Wall Street Journal column that, “This type of violence, jihad, is what they, the Islamists, believe. There are numerous calls to violent jihad in the Quran.” Too often, people are guilty of mistaking that the view of the extremists is representative of the entire religious group’s views. Such a generalization is always wrong. I could say the same things about Christianity — or any other religion — that Ali does. A Christian fanatic was behind the massacre in Norway, and evangelism is certainly an important tenet of Christianity. Even with my limited biblical knowledge, I can point to gruesome moments in the Scripture. Genesis depicts Christians tricking pagans into mass circumcision and then murdering them as revenge for violating Dinah. As Nicholas Kristof points out in his column, we cannot view Islam as one homogenous entity when it has the rich history and diversity it does. As we look beyond the terrorist attacks against Charlie Hebdo and contemplate how to make sense of Islam, we must avoid making calls guided by an oversimplification. Something I noticed in the comments section of Brooks’s column was the repeated argument that women should not wear burqas because they are anti-feminist, offensive and indicative of their desire against assimilating into Europe and America. This would be true if all Muslim women were forced to wear burqas. However, many women voluntarily choose to cover themselves because of their religious convictions. They are exercising their feminist rights, just as a woman participating in the Slut Walk is. Feminism is about the right of a woman to make whatever choices she pleases. It is not about how much skin she shows. Further, saying that these women are against assimilation because they wear a burqa is akin to saying that people can only be part of a society if they look and act like the majority; this, of course, is not tolerance. It is perhaps natural to be angry at Islam after the tragedy in Paris, but it is neither mature nor justified. When we make calls about the future of Islam, we must remember that we cannot be guilty of oversimplification. We, as Americans, did not claim that Christianity needs to change after the massacre in Norway because we are able to differentiate between extremists and mainstream Christianity. We, as Americans, for the most part do not say that circumcision of infants by Jewish people is child abuse because we understand that it is part of Jewish tenet. Such is the attitude we need to take when we view the Islamic world and try to make sense of what happened in Paris. I am saddened by the tragedy in Paris. I am afraid that our oversimplifications and lack of understanding will lead to more violence and enmity tomorrow.|~|Erica Choi is a freshman from Bronxville, NY.

76338|~|Part of the Princeton Tradition*|~|   January 8 2015|~|Columns Joke Issue Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|All great writers who have thoughts begin their pieces with quotes from others. So, too, will I quote the timeless classic “High School Musical”: “If you wanna be cool/Follow one simple rule/Don’t mess with the flow, no, no/Stick to the status quo!” This sentiment is most applicable to our school calendar, particularly regarding final exams. Princeton administrators probably “wanna be cool” by sticking to the same calendar that has existed for centuries of academic excellence. If Michelle Obama ’85, Queen Noor ’73, Jeff Bezos ’86 and Sonia Sotomayor ’76 took their examinations after break, we certainly should, too. I would even venture to argue that post-winter break finals has, in fact, directly led to their success in life. The ability to write 90-plus pages during reading period must have helped Sotomayor write legal opinions. The ability to recall a semester’s worth of learning after a three- (but sometimes two-) week break must have helped Bezos streamline Amazon’s delivery model. The ability to write an exam in a foreign language, especially after not having class practice time for three or four weeks, must have helped improve Queen Noor’s ability to negotiate with world leaders in different languages. I have written about my views on post-winter break finals but have since realized their value. Judging from Facebook statuses, like every good journalist, I can see that many Princeton students are feeling stressed about final papers and exams. However, if these extremely successful alumni could do it, who are we to complain about this exam schedule? It is a timeless part of the Princeton Tradition, newer than Nassau Hall — but older than Princeton’s first coeducational class! — and should be lauded as an important part of our University experience. In a New York Times article from April 1974, Sotomayor is quoted (albeit on the subject of recruiting Puerto Rican and Chicano faculty members) as saying, “Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making substantive efforts to change.” Clearly, Princeton has a policy of “sticking to the status quo,” and it is time that we students realize how important that policy is to our learning. Our University stands strongly on many issues — from the strict “one fruit from the dining hall” policy to our (strange) salute during “Old Nassau” to the Honor Code — and we should appreciate that our University stands for Tradition. As a student who studied abroad this fall, I experienced the “other” type of calendar: a calendar in which students submit their papers and finish their exams before winter break. I must admit, it was a pleasant experience to enjoy my break feeling sane, well-rested and relaxed. I would even go so far as to say that I have since been “unproductive” by spending my time reading for pleasure instead of for class. However, this is one of the most important aspects of leaving the calendar the way it is: keeping Princetonians on their toes. With midterms due during fall break and spring break, homework assigned during Thanksgiving and finals after winter break, the University is telling us one thing: free time is simply not a part of our Tradition. If we are to be as successful as our alumni, we must stick to Tradition and continue working through all holidays (except, of course, America’s favorite holiday, Intersession!) in order to learn real-world skills. Without our Tradition, Princeton would crumble. If we are attempting to model ourselves off of the British greats, Oxford and Cambridge, we must stick to our Tradition as fiercely as they: after all, Oxford students still take examinations wearing robes, and Cambridge students cannot walk on the same grass as their professors. Fellow Princetonians, this is my public apology for my previously dissenting voice, for I had not yet connected the post-winter break finals Tradition with our Princeton Tradition. As the minutes tick by as you sit in Firestone Library or Forbes College, remember this moment as part of Princetonian history. This is not just your stress; it is the Tradition’s stress. This is not just your Dean’s Date final paper; this is the Tradition’s paper. This exam is not just about you; this exam is about Tradition. Join me in celebrating our Tradition — it binds us together, for life, for future lives and forever.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

This year, it was clear what our peers wanted: Will Gansa ’17 for Government Club. But we disagreed. Not because our egos were bruised when Will Gansa declined to speak with us. Nay, it was because we believe there is a higher calling for Gansa. Thus, the Editorial Board wholeheartedly and unreservedly endorses Gansa for University Club President. Last year, we admonished the student body for failing to talk about ourselves enough. And yet, even with our well-articulated, thoughtful and insightful argumentation (as always), campus culture failed to change. And look what that has led to: an administration that cruelly destroyed our beloved ICE, that forced unripened fruit into our stomachs and that — worst of all — failed to pursue bike reform. The tyranny of undemocratic incumbency that is the current University Club administration, under University Club President Eisgruber ’83 must be overthrown. We are not petty or elitist. We. Are. Miserable. And we deserve happiness. We deserve an administration that wants us to be happy and that tirelessly and solely works to make us happy. Who cares about the professors, who are just pawns of a University bent on making us work… So wake up, Princeton! Show the world that we are not apathetic or unengaged. March down to Nassau Hall, overthrow this dictatorial University Club and implement a new regime of waffle fries. Will Gansa. Will Gansa. Will Gansa. The Will of the People. Correction: Due to reporting errors, an earlier version of this article contained a number of inaccuracies. First, an earlier version of the article did not properly identify the current President of the University Club. It is Christopher Eisgruber, not Shirley Tilghman. Second, an earlier version of this article referred to University Club improperly as simply University.  Third, an earlier version of this article forgot to mention that the reason Will Gansa was not previously endorsed is that he declined to speak with the ‘Prince.’ The ‘Prince’ regrets these errors.

76295|~|Basicness for all*|~|   January 8 2015|~|Columns Joke Issue Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|A study published on Thursday in the Journal of Basic Anthropology found that 70 percent of individuals who are popularly branded as “basic white chicks,” more colloquially known as “bwbs,” are not white. The research showed that the most recognizable symptoms of a bwb — thinking Uggs are effective snow boots, demonstrating an uncanny necessity for Starbucks-brand caffeine, speaking as though everything is a simile — are not unique to Caucasians. In fact, nonwhite basic white girls are outraged at the unjust nature of such a title since being white is ostensibly a prerequisite to being crowned a bwb. Why is such a privilege only granted to white girls when I, being an Iranian, aspire for such a status, too? Why do only white girls get to be basic? “Whiteness” is a social construction that promotes inequity, and our valuation must change in order to return to our core values of egalitarianism. If we don’t discriminate against Uggs based on the color of the boot, then it is undeniably hypocritical to discriminate against basic girls based on the color of their skin. We demand equal opportunity in the eyes of society. And in the eyes of the law. This is yet another instance of unfair discrimination based on race — a blatant violation of our protected rights and liberties under the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Everyone must be treated fairly and impartially, regardless of race or skin color. Hence, anyone should be able to receive such a basic epithet, if they warrant the title. Times have changed. Likewise, so have our demographics. Not a day need go by frappuccino-free in Seoul, the most Starbucks-filled city. Sales have grown rapidly in China and in the Asia-Pacific region — faster than in any other region, and in South Korea, the determination to prove themselves equally capable (and equally basic) has reached unprecedented levels, so much so that they had to be curbed so as to protect the well-being of zealous selfie-takers. Too many have gone to great measures to demonstrate their capabilities, losing their lives in such brave undertakings, which inevitably led to a banning of the selfie stick in the country. Similarly, Iranians have realized that basicness offers a much-needed reprieve from the austerity of daily life. Yoga pants have become a basic asset, with many attending yoga classes every week across the Middle East. Behold: the revolution of the new basic nonwhite white chick. But then, what about our brothers? Can a man not be a bwb, let alone a nonwhite man? Once again, the social construction of gender has infringed upon our basic liberties and rights — the fundamental right to be basic. We remain oblivious to this flagrant act of sexism. Basic men remain in the shadows, too wary of speaking up out of ineradicable fear of being faced with angry bwbs who refuse to speak their minds beyond the occasional “ugh,” or even worse, out of fear of being barraged with angsty subtweets laden with cliché lyrics. This is a revolution. I, the basic Persian girl, am instigating change. I am demanding fair and equal treatment of all the basic individuals in the world. The “basic white girl” is an antiquated, anachronistic term that must be updated. We must demand justice or else the basic white girl’s voice will rise above ours. Her “can’t even’s” will evolve into “can even’s” while we remain in fetters. The struggle is, in fact, real.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

76103|~|The fault in our films|~|   January 6 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|For my friends, the process of choosing a movie involves nearly half an hour of deliberation, weighing individual preferences and moods (and the availability of certain titles on Netflix or quasi-reputable streaming sites). We float suggestions as disparate as Silence of the Lambs and Shakespeare in Love, and sometimes the whole endeavor is too fraught with conflict that we end up giving up altogether. The other night, however, we were all able to settle on Snowpiercer, the premise of which is a train that holds the survivors of a new Ice Age caused by scientists trying to combat global warming and succeeding all too well. The cars are ordered based on class lines, and those in the very back attempt to fight their way to the front after years of oppression and deplorable conditions. A little dark, but it sounded interesting enough to silence calls for Daddy Day Care. Within the first twenty minutes, the darkness took its toll. Beyond the bleakness of the environment, the scenes of torture, beatings, and families torn apart rendered one of my friends and me incapable of continuing in that moment. Another friend did not fully understand our impulse to change the movie, for she argued that we should finish Snowpiercer and embrace the emotional discomfort of seeing actions that happen every day to people all over the world. Worse things happened, she said, and we should not run from an emotional experience that would likely pay larger dividends in the future from a temporary state of anxiety. And she’s right, at least with regard to the reality of our world. Much worse has happened, happens, and will happen. It’s important to understand this as we move into our futures and attempt to affect change, and film is one particularly effective medium through which to gain such knowledge. I don’t think, however, that it is the only medium to do so, nor do I think that one must necessarily suffer through two hours of this in the name of a slightly-heightened awareness, particularly when one’s present emotional state would render such lessons useless. My friend (who also had difficulty watching) and I spent much of this first quarter hour covering our eyes, shrinking back into the couch and asking when the violence would stop. Could anyone really say that we gained a greater understanding by staring at the dark abysses of our palms and hearing only screams? Should we have forced ourselves to watch? Perhaps. But maybe not. There’s something to be said in our day and age for not being desensitized to violence and to images of human suffering—so long as one couples this with an acknowledgement of the reality of our world, and not the suppression of such a harsh truth. This, I think, was at the root of my other friend’s argument for why we should continue watching. She worried that we would construct walls in our minds separating the unpleasant from the safe, and we would neglect the former until another movie, another book, another song made it impossible; such a concern is not unfounded. What I just described is something very human. At the same time, there are other ways to express the terrors that plague individuals every day without showing them directly. In many cases, these alternatives, are more effective by virtue of their ability to tap into the human imagination. The movie we turned on next, in fact, demonstrates this point perfectly. We ultimately chose to watch Forrest Gump, a film following a man across decades of his life and the ways in which he interacts with United States history and, in some ways, personifies ideals central to America. Implications of physical and sexual abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, and different forms of bigotry, among other serious topics, run their threads just under the surface, only occasionally explicitly mentioned or shown. This is what makes the movie so powerful. Through the lens of another human’s perspective, you see the struggles and failures of your loved ones, and of humanity as a whole without the impulse to cover your eyes.|~|
76110|~|With great privilege|~|   January 6 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jonathan Lu|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Privilege can isolate us from our responsibilities. For example, many Congressmen are privileged: their average net worth is over $1 million. Living in posh Washington, D.C., and funded by huge corporations and banks, they pass laws for special interests rather than for their constituents. A recent Princeton study found that the U.S. political system is closer to an oligarchy than to a democracy. CEOs are also privileged. However, many simply focus on making more money rather than using their power to help those who lack it. Ninety-five percent of 2009-12 income gains since the crisis went to the wealthiest 1 percent. Bankers and stock traders, too, are privileged. They would play games with people’s livelihoods and the national economy in order to help themselves. Why does this relate to Princeton students? Well, those lawmakers, those bankers, those multibillionaires? In 15 years, we will be them. More than one-third of Princetonians enter finance after graduation. Princetonians found and run huge businesses: just look at Jeff Bezos ’86 (Amazon), Steve Forbes ’70 (Forbes) and Meg Whitman ’77 (eBay). There is a whole Wikipedia page on Princetonians in government. Because many of us will become powerful and influential, our Princeton experience should teach us to recognize our own privilege and understand our responsibility to society. Only so can we fulfill our informal motto “Princeton in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations.” One possible policy to help us move toward this ideal is to build civic engagement into our graduation requirements. Just like most American high schools, Princeton can require us to complete a set number of hours of service. Community service at the undergraduate level could be even more important than at the high school level because, with the free time, freedom and superb resources in college, we could work on bigger and better projects. Moreover, service could influence our career decisions. Service would extricate us from the Orange Bubble, in which everyone is laser-focused on the next step: finance, graduate school, law school, medical school. By interacting with and serving those who lack our privilege, we would gain a clearer perspective on our motivations and goals. I suspect prestige, peers, power and parents’ wishes play larger roles in our career decisions than they should. Service reminds us of our higher calling as Princetonians. In the vein of forcing us to check our privilege, the University could also institute a distribution requirement specifically designed for us to consider others’ viewpoints. Princeton for Ferguson has advocated for distribution requirements in issues of identity and diversity, such as African-American studies or sociology. Engaging alternate and unheard viewpoints takes us out of our own insular world views. The University could also build a privilege-examining program into freshman orientation. For example, we could hold discussions on the privilege we have at Princeton, just as we did on diversity and the meaning of life. Such a beginning could drive us to take a new class or a new major, at the time most ripe for exploration. Finally, classes could be supplemented with projects that engage the underserved. Politics classes could assign research papers to investigate how local underserved populations are helped or hurt by certain laws. Economics classes could partner with local businesses and retailers to show how those without privilege earn their living. Science and engineering classes could investigate science literacy and perform outreach (projects, presentations, classes) to those who never considered STEM careers. Princeton is a superb place for academics, but we risk losing sight of our place in the broader social context if we don’t apply what we’ve learned. Official policy won’t be enough. On paper, we can say that we understand the world beyond our privilege, but we must truly take it upon ourselves to be aware. Through activism and dialogue, we should fight the blind self-interest prevalent on this campus. It’s a given that many of us will gain great power. However, we must take the responsibility that comes with it.|~|Jonathan Lu is a freshman from Fremont, Calif. He can be reached at jhlu@princeton.edu. 
76101|~|Reclaiming Winter Break|~|   January 6 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Princetonians, mark your calendars. Our 2015 winter break has been reduced to two weeks. The debate on the length of winter break is annual; the Editorial Board and many opinion columnists have argued for an adjusted calendar during years when the winter break was three weeks long. With next year in mind, I call for the University to decide what is best for students; if the policy of final exams after break is actually beneficial for students, the University should give students the full three weeks of winter break. The academic calendar is determined three years in advance and follows certain rules according to the Office of the Registrar: the fall term defines a “midterm recess of nine days and a Thanksgiving recess of five days.” The winter recess is defined “between seventeen and twenty-four days, beginning between December 12th and 18th of the ending year, and ends on the Sunday between January 1st and 7th.” Therein lies the discrepancy of one week. It is this metronomic rule that fluctuates by a whole winter’s week that should be reexamined. This reduced break will unequivocally hinder all students. Members of the faculty have argued that the best written work comes in the fall semester because of the break and the time it allows students to truly work through their essay topics. This may be true, but now, with only two weeks, students will be held to the same standards without the same amount of time. Further, seniors wishing to conduct thesis research over winter break will have less time than their predecessors did. (As a rising senior, this is my most immediate concern.) Finally, international students whose longer flights and farther destinations will suffer logistically from less time at home, especially because most international students do not return home during fall, spring or Intersession breaks. I personally believe our calendar should be revised to have final exams before winter break. There is no lack of examples of peer institutions whose calendars, once challenged, were changed. In 2008, Harvard moved its finals to December. Some point to the opportunity of reading period as a reason to keep exams where they are, that students can thaw the freeze-dried studying we avoided during the break. However, the strange schedule we acclimate to during winter break — juggling free time, holidays and the gnawing feeling of impending deadlines — cannot be helpful for our sanity or test scores. Some argue that reading period benefits students’ ability to recall information by having a week devoted to studying. I contend this, especially for students in language classes; the break is detrimental as most students do not have access to the face-to-face speaking and listening time of the classroom during winter break. Additionally, the month of January aligns with deadlines for internships and jobs, including many funding and fellowship opportunities offered by the University. While Princeton students are taking finals and working on independent work, our peers at other institutions are privileged with a head start on the search. If our finals are to remain after the winter break, there should at least be consistency in the length of the break. If administrators agree that student happiness should be taken into account, then they should work with the Undergraduate Student Government and take a comprehensive look at student reasoning to revisit the calendar. If administrators argue that students benefit from finals after break, then they should give them enough time to semi-enjoy it. Two weeks is not enough. Princeton, take your pick.|~|

76010|~|New year, new us|~|   January 4 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Here’s a riddle: What is meant to make but never to keep? Answer: A New Year’s resolution. According to psychology research from the University of Calgary, our efforts won’t come to fruition if results don’t come instantly. But we can’t always expect instantaneous results. We can’t reasonably expect to derive benefits immediately or affect immediate positive change. Sometimes it’s a marathon, not a sprint, as pointed out by University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan. She was talking about changing campus culture, and so should we. With the new year should come a more positive campus culture that encourages dialogue on campus regarding mental health, sexual assault, race, religion and politics. It’s time to finally make this resolution and to keep it. This is a marathon that we’ll be running not for the next week, two weeks, six months or year. It’s one we’ll be running for many years, but this indeterminacy should not daunt us. As a matter of fact, it’s one we’ve already begun, but one we have yet to persevere in, perhaps in hope of seeing the finish line. We’ve established the Mental Health Initiative Board, planned an annual Mental Health Week and most recently passed a referendum for greater transparency about withdrawal policies in relation to mental health concerns. We’ve lowered the burden of proof for cases of sexual assault and rape and put an extra $140,000 in funding toward Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources and Education this year. We’ve marched to protest the grand jury decision on officer Darren Wilson’s case, the largest student and faculty protest in years, as well as staged a walkout and die-in to protest both the Eric Garner and Ferguson grand jury decisions. We’ve sent around petitions to students, faculty and alumni to sign on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We’ve even taken it to social media, denouncing yaks on Tiger Microaggressions. We have reached a mile marker, but this marathon is far from over. More than ever, students remain wary, even fearful, of going to CPS, anticipating compulsion to withdraw due to mental health issues. No student should ever not be able to seek help. We successfully enacted policy reform. We held conversations between students and the administration regarding mental health, only to make more apparent the fears that students harbor about the issue. We have yet to engender security, openness and a campus culture that does not affix stigma to imperfection or vulnerability. The University was found guilty of Title IX violations back in November, and the school undeniably took concrete, efficacious steps toward protecting students’ well-being. But we still have a full marathon to run before we fully address the University’s explicit historical problem of sexual assault, dating back to 1987 with horrific backlash at a Take Back the Night vigil for victims of sexual assault. No policy measure will effectively put an end to rape culture and frat culture (or, rather, Street culture). But by eradicating the stigma to reporting sexual assault, and by thoroughly and impartially investigating each case — without regard to gender — there’s hope of reaching the finish line. There has been a reactivation of a spirit of protest and activism on campus, as with the march to protest Darren Wilson’s fate. Nonetheless, we see a preponderance of bigoted, condemning yaks on Yik Yak, ascribing fault to people solely based on race in light of the slew of protests. And we have many a mile to run before we can encourage even more students to be politically and socially active in protesting both police brutality and the killing of police officers. While each milestone should exhort us to push further, we’ve also taken regressed in some cases. We’ve raised our voice on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by writing and sending out petitions advocating for the University to divest from companies supporting Israel’s occupation of the West Bank on the one hand, and a counter-petition opposing the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement on the other. But people have proceeded to stifle our voice by vandalizing a Gaza memorial set up by the Princeton Committee on Palestine, honoring both Israeli and Palestinian lives lost. People have torn down posters spreading the word about both petitions. This sort of activism is deplorable, and our campus should be able to foster activism without harassment or antagonism. Then there’s the Facebook page “Tiger Microaggressions,” which reports instances of “microaggression.” Nevertheless, it offers no clear parameters for what exactly constitutes a microaggression. Hence, absolutely anything can qualify as such, and as Zeena Mubarak pointed out in her column, “[T]he potency of such [offensive] yaks is severely diluted when other less inflammatory statements are presented on the same page in the same manner.” We should be combating racism, sexism and prejudice, but we should also practice discretion in what actually qualifies as an “aggression.” The National Review listed “Tiger Microaggressions” as the number one most politically correct moment on college campuses in 2014, but this is no singularity. The status quo expresses a disconcerting level of comfort with political correctness, but when anything can be deemed offensive or marginalizing, it has gone too far. We can say anything and face being censured for being “politically incorrect,” be it as students in daily conversation or as administration officials reconsidering school policy. We’d rather preserve decorum and good manners over legal matters, such as rape and involuntary withdrawal, to evade brutal truths and to save face, just as the University of Virginia has done. And Princeton is far from inculpable. Undoubtedly, we’ve taken huge strides. But it’s not enough when our campus still remains generally averse to open, effective discourse. Our new year is the time for a new us and a reformed, more positive campus culture.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz. She can be reached at ssakha@princeton.edu. 
75995|~|The history of "wh": a microaggression|~|   January 4 2015|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|I love puns. My ninth grade classmates can attest to this, for I would begin each day with my corniest new discovery. Without fail, my jokes would set off a chorus of groans. Today I have a groaner to share with you: What did the grape say when the elephant sat on it? Nothing, but it let out a little wine. I never told this particular pun to my friends, because it doesn’t quite work in my part of Tennessee. There, “wine” and “whine” have distinct pronunciations. We say “wine” just as you might, but when we whine we /hwine/. There’s an /h/ sound before the /w/. You might think our way of saying /hw/ is backwards since the word starts out “wh,” and you’d be right. But /hwine/ is actually the traditional pronunciation. In fact, the Merriam-Webster dictionary entry for “whine” gives /hwine/ first and the newer /wine/ form second. This pattern carries through most “wh”-words. For “which,” Webster gives /hwich/. For “where,” it gives /hwer/. I can’t tell you why the pronunciation and spelling are flipped, but I can say that the sound came first. It made its way to Old English through the Gothic letter hwair. At the time, it was written in English as “hw” — just as you would expect. Somehow, the spelling flipped to “wh” in Middle English, and we’ve kept the inverted form ever since. The pronunciation shift from /hw/ to /w/ — causing “whine” to sound like “wine” — is a newer development. Linguists have appropriately dubbed it the “wine-whine merger,” and it may have started in thirteenth-century England. For half a millenium, the merger was shunned as a mark of low education. By the late 1700s, however, the /w/ pronunciation had caught on, and the merger is complete in most states today. William Labov writes in The Atlas of North American English, published in 2006, that only 17 percent of speakers preserve the /hw/ sound, most of them from a band that runs across the Southeast. There is a town in that band that I call home, so I say my “wh”-words in the traditional way. I never thought twice about it before coming to New Jersey. Here, my peers make a spectacle of it. “Say Cool Whip,” they’ll tell me, in reference to the Family Guy gag in which one character pokes fun at another for his /hw/ pronunciations. I’ll say “Cool Whip.” They’ll repeat it back to me with exaggerated emphasis on the /h/. I’ve been pulled into this conversation several times now, and each time I grow a bit more self-conscious. Very few people like to have their speech mocked. Now, I am sure the others never mean their offense. Therefore, I will play along and let them have their laugh. You wouldn’t know it from my columns, but I avoid confrontation when I can. Besides, this is not very important to me. I am a male and I am white, so I get less than my fair share of discrimination. I am ashamed to say that I have complained when I have had such fortune, but I must confess that I did. A friend of mine whom I quite like had put me through the “Cool Whip” routine, so I waited awhile and texted her this: “Making fun of regional speech is a microaggression.” Again, I am ashamed of that text. But I learned a lot from her response. “Better put that on TM,” she said, referring to the Tiger Microaggressions page notorious for posting inoffensive “aggressions.” There came no apology or retraction. She really did not understand that she had caused any offense, even after I had plainly told her so. That is fine with me, and I don’t blame her one bit. If I were her, I am afraid I would not have understood either. I mean it when I say I am afraid. I am afraid that I have spent eighteen years not understanding when I have said something offensive. I am afraid that I have unwittingly hurt the feelings of people so accustomed to microaggression that they did not bother to speak up. I am afraid that I would not have taken those people seriously if they had made a stand. And I am afraid I will do it all again. I am afraid because microaggressions aren’t harmless — there’s research to show that they cause anxiety and binge drinking among the minority students who are targeted. To become more aware of my own shortcomings is a debt I owe to others, so please send me a message if I have ever hurt your feelings. I will do what I can to make it up to you. In the meantime, I ask that my readers try doing the same. You might be causing people offense without intending to. Understanding how others feel is hard for those of us who do not suffer discrimination often, but with a little conscious effort, we can start correcting our mistakes.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn.

75997|~|Editorial: In support of inclusive student activism|~|   January 4 2015|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Student responses to the Michael Brown and Eric Garner grand jury decisions have challenged the characterization of the University as a community that shies away from activism. The Nov. 25 protest on Prospect Avenue and the Dec. 4 “die-in,” along with other student-led events, have brought students of all backgrounds into a discussion on the ways in which race affects students’ experiences at the University and how the University can create a safer and more supportive environment. While policy recommendations from the Council of the Princeton University Community have yet to be released, the effects of student activism have already been felt. Topics regarding diversity, inclusion and equity have entered into both precept debates and dining hall discussions, as students more than ever have taken it upon themselves to critically evaluate the behavior in which they engage and the norms they perpetuate, inadvertently or otherwise. The Board believes the discourse surrounding pressing social issues should continue and commends the students who, through their activism, have inspired a respectful and open campus-wide discussion. All too often, students here focus on their studies and extracurricular endeavors at the expense of engaging with important national and international events. The “die-in” following the Eric Garner grand jury decision, in particular, was tremendously successful at interrupting students’ regular schedules to draw attention to an issue that all individuals, especially those fortunate enough to receive a top-tier education, should engage with. The Board believes the “die-in” and similar events that force students to confront important questions from outside the “Orange Bubble” are an integral part of a Princeton education. Such events encourage students to apply the knowledge and analytical tools they have developed in courses to find solutions to the challenges of our society, making students internalize the University’s unofficial motto, “Princeton in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations.” In order to further develop this important facet of a Princeton education, the Board encourages students to continue looking beyond FitzRandolph Gate to find issues of social justice about which they are passionate. Furthermore, the Board appreciates that student activists communicated with the student body using a variety of platforms. Activists chose to balance more disruptive protests with more accessible town hall meetings and participation in a University-sponsored panel. The multitude of forums from which students could express their views gave students of all temperaments a home within the greater movement of students concerned with issues of diversity, inclusion and equity. Moreover, the campus’s willingness to hear multiple points of view has allowed all interested students to voice their opinions and contribute to the campus discussion. The Board appreciates this kind of open dialogue and encourages future activists to similarly operate in an inclusive manner. Finally, the Board is proud of the more transparent and expressive environment that has developed over the past month. Students making their voices heard has resulted in an awareness of injustices on campus and in the University creating a task force to pose solutions to the hurdles certain students face. Moreover, the Board believes that students’ willingness to participate in the dialogue surrounding Ferguson has only positively contributed to more active discussions of other campus issues such as the challenges women face within the eating clubs. Continued activism and dialogue are key to improving campus culture and improving the Princeton educational experience.

75811|~|Handling rape hearings on campus|~|   December 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Cameron Langford|~|None|~|On Nov. 19, Rolling Stone published “A Rape on Campus,” a now-notorious story about the alleged gang rape of University of Virginia junior “Jackie” at a fraternity formal event her freshman year. On Dec. 5, on the basis of further investigation by The Washington Post, which found that the alleged fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, did not host a formal event the weekend Jackie claims she was raped in their house, Rolling Stone published an even more notorious “Note to Our Readers,” casting doubt over Jackie’s account and apologizing for having put too much trust in her story. In the note, the managing editor, Will Dana, wrote that the magazine was “mistaken in honoring Jackie’s request not to contact the alleged assaulters to get their account.” The criticism was swift and fierce, with news outlets like Vox arguing that Rolling Stone’s failure to speak to the accused in the reporting process failed both accuser and accused and, rather than protecting Jackie, left her vulnerable to allegations that she was crying rape. I agree that Rolling Stone failed in its journalistic duty: to paraphrase Dana, the truth is almost always better served by getting both sides of a story. And I think that, ideally, universities would be able to do what Rolling Stone didn’t and, through a swift and fair adjudication process, let both accuser and accused have their day in court. Unfortunately, most universities do as poor a job adjudicating sexual assault cases as Rolling Stone did fact checking. If we want to get closer to the truth about rape on college campuses, and to protect, as fits the facts, the women who experience it and the men who are accused of it, universities are going to have to step up to the plate handed them by Title IX, which students from sexual harassment and assault. The first problem is that victims are rarely encouraged to come forward with formal reports, and an informal report rarely results in anything more serious than a no-contact order. (Jackie, reportedly overwhelmed by options and a lack of guidance from the head of UVA’s Sexual Misconduct Board, chose to do nothing.) Moreover, even when a formal complaint is filed, poor management of the adjudication process often favors the alleged assaulter and causes additional trauma to the alleged victim; trials are often called “the second rape” according to a study commissioned by the Violence Against Women Act. This summer, The New York Times detailed the story of a sexual assault hearing at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, in which the victim’s rape kit results were ignored. An Occidental College student reported another mishandled case to The Nation, claiming that members of the panel laughed and chatted with her alleged attacker during a break. Finally, even when guilt has been determined, universities have not always enforced punishments significant enough to make the victim feel safe on campus. A student attending Davidson College, a liberal arts college in my North Carolina hometown, wrote an article for Her Campus last spring detailing the minimal restrictions her attacker faced even after being found guilty: 20 hours of counseling and a ban from her Eating House, a social organization similar to a sorority. These mishandlings are egregious, given that rape on college campuses is all too frequent. About one in five college students will be sexually assaulted during their undergraduate years; at Princeton, that number is around one in six. Yet, nationwide, rape remains seriously underreported — only five percent of cases are reported to law enforcement — largely because victims fear the kind of treatment detailed above. The University has made a number of strides in recent months to bring its sexual assault policies in line with Title IX regulations that may help remedy these problems, including removing students from the advisory panel and using trained investigators as fact-finders and adjudicators. However, on a campus where only six rapes cases were reported to University officials last year, as part of the University’s agreement with the Office for Civil Rights, at least 11 previously decided cases will undergo review for violating Title IX. It’s clear that it will take more than policy changes to make a difference. Administrators will need to create an environment where victims feel comfortable coming forward because they trust that their story will be fairly heard and evaluated. I am sympathetic to the difficulties universities face in adjudicating sexual assault cases. The stakes are high: a wrong decision could devastate a victim’s college experience or, conversely, destine the wrongfully accused to a lifetime of stigmatization in, among other things, finding employment, for which one former student is suing Wesleyan University. Moreover, there are a number of difficulties in determining guilt. Defining consent can be tricky when alcohol is involved. Victims of trauma may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, confusing their timeline or other details, and physical evidence in cases of assault is ephemeral. But as long as rape continues to happen on college campuses, universities will have a duty to make campus safe for their students by giving sexual assault hearings a fair trial. When victims don’t have a voice on campus, they turn to off-campus outlets. Unfortunately, as the Rolling Stone incident demonstrated, those have failed them too.|~|Cameron Langford is a politics major from Davidson, N.C. She can be reached at cplangfo@princeton.edu. 
75833|~|Editorial: Internal eating club surveys |~|   December 11 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|In reaction to recent events, Tiger Inn underwent an internal dialogue and survey to determine how the environment of the eating club could be improved, and particularly how it could be made more welcoming to female members. The Editorial Board is glad to see renewed conversation about the culture of the Street, not only within the TI community, but also on the pages of The Daily Princetonian and national media, as well as at dinner tables and in classrooms. Nevertheless, the Board believes that this conversation should be expanded to all eating clubs. A great place for each of the clubs to start is by conducting internal surveys and dialogues about their own Bicker, pickups and initiations traditions. In general, steps ought to be taken to sustain this conversation, which has, in the past, often dissipated before it could produce any sustained effort towards cultural reform. Many students tend to remain silent on the issue of Street culture, even if they wish it would change. In many cases, this silence stems from the assumption that speaking out will not lead to any noticeable improvements or that voicing dissatisfaction might unsettle relationships with fellow or potential club members. Students can feel that they are not close enough to club leadership (officers and graduate board members) to make their voices heard, that there is no credible forum for expressing their concerns or that there is enormous pressure to perpetuate a harmful culture. Above all, Bickerees are frequently stifled by the social demands that accompany application to selective institutions; they are unlikely to challenge the practices of those who are weighing their admission prospects. Once they have been accepted or turned away and no longer invested in the club, Bickerees become less directly invested in scrutinizing Bicker and initiations customs. To rectify this problem, eating club graduate boards should issue surveys through which students can speak out (anonymously, but by name if they so choose) on such matters as Bicker and initiations practices that make them uncomfortable; which events, games and rituals were agreeable and which were troubling; and how clubs can cultivate environments that are more welcoming to current and prospective members. These surveys could give students the option of volunteering to speak directly with graduate board members and undergraduate officers to follow up on whatever thoughts they expressed in writing. Furthermore, the surveys should be accompanied by (a) the production and circulation among members of honest and thorough reports on the direction members wish to go and (b) meetings at which members and leaders could present and discuss their graduate board’s findings. Such measures would have the benefit of encouraging club members previously apathetic or uneasy about getting involved in the criticism — or defense — of their clubs’ cultures to reconsider. While many have dwelt primarily on punishments for the egregious transgressions at TI (and while such consequences may well be appropriate), the Board firmly believes that meaningful changes to the culture of the Street must ultimately come about through dialogue by encouraging students who disapprove of the ways their clubs operate to make themselves heard. For students who do not currently feel able to do so, anonymous surveys would provide a much-needed outlet. For students who are more comfortable about publicly sharing their positions, surveys and conversations would provide an equally valuable catalyst for reflection and dialogue. We are hopeful that the conversation instigated by the events at TI will continue and that, through such, Street culture up and down Prospect Avenue will become more respectful and inclusive.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief. 
75817|~|Don’t forget|~|   December 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Julia Case-Levine|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Twenty-two years ago, thousands of protestors flooded the streets of South Central Los Angeles, Calif. Days earlier, a jury had reached a verdict in a case brought against four police officers accused of brutally beating Rodney King, a black man pulled to the side of the road for speeding. The violence was captured on video which depicted excessive force on the part of the officers; after an initial striking, an incapacitated King was beaten with batons and kicked numerous times. None of this swayed the jury to convict. All four officers were acquitted. Rage, grief, pain, frustration; emotions were extreme and riots in Los Angeles quickly turned violent. Cory Booker, now a New Jersey senator, wrote in an opinion piece as an undergraduate at Stanford at the time, “I’m struggling to be articulate, loquacious, positive, constructive, but for the first time in so long, I have lost control of my emotions.” In 2014, these words still ring true. It’s hard to remain optimistic when 22 years breed little change. Rodney King, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice — we have seen the same cases over and over again for decades, the same dangerous mix of racism and law enforcement’s state-sanctioned ability to use force, the same broken justice system that lets police officers — most often white — walk free but sentences others — most often black men — to life in jail for nonviolent drug crimes. Last Thursday, a federal civil rights investigation into the Cleveland Police Department for the past two years unearthed a record of gross misuse of force against black men. From pepper spraying and tasering subjects who were already being restrained, to kicking a man so badly he later had to be treated for a broken bone in his face, the violence catalogued in the report was heartbreaking. Twenty-two years, and police brutality against black men is still making headlines. As disheartening, demoralizing and dehumanizing as these defeats are, now is not the time to give up. It’s time to ask how we, Princeton students, can institute meaningful change. How can we fix a broken law enforcement and criminal justice system that continues to be infected with bias and racism? This question can’t be answered succinctly or definitively. Student opinions diverge on how to respond to the Brown case; in an opinion column published in The Daily Princetonian on Dec. 9, Newby Parton expressed his reluctance to participate in student protests because he was “not angry at the grand jury’s verdict in the Michael Brown case.” The Brown case has been a polarizing issue on campus, and the details of precisely what happened may never be known. However, I would urge students to remember, regardless of their impressions of the Ferguson decision, that Brown does not stand alone. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Legal Defense Fund recently posted a series of tweets with the names of 76 unarmed black men and women who were killed in police custody in the past 15 years. The misuse of violence in the Brown case wasn’t an isolated incident. Rather, the Brown case was one of many instances of unjustified police brutality directed towards black Americans. Other pockets of students sympathetic to the protest’s message question its practical implications. How will protesting directly contribute to change? To these students, I would say not to underestimate the value of peacefully vocalizing anger. Do not underestimate the value of nonviolent demonstrations. Do not forget the tremendous steps forward made in this country inspired in large part by the student-led protests during the civil rights movement. Even more recently, we’ve seen the powerful impact protests have had on immigration reform. Powerful systemic change begins with a transformation of public sentiment; protests work to galvanize communities. Protests energize groups and mobilize leaders. They increase visibility; Princeton protests have already attracted media coverage. For some, seeing like-minded students stand together in protest helps heal the pain of senseless violence. And perhaps, most importantly, they keep us angry. Whether or not you attended the protest, what’s most important is to stay fired up and engaged. We must not become desensitized to these injustices; we must remain incensed. We must stay vigilant and continue to press and challenge authorities, the justice department, local officials, parents, teachers and friends to stand up. At Princeton, we learn values we will take with us into our future careers; let one of those values be persistence. We develop standards that will influence how we approach problems; let one of those standards be an unwavering demand for fairness and accountability. We refine our sense of justice that will impact whether or not we tolerate unwarranted violence; let that sense of justice burn against systematic oppression. We are granted resources that allow us to reach for the stars, to be the top of whatever profession we specialize in; let’s use that power to avidly demand reform. Don’t forget, Princeton. Let’s not let another 22 years pass without change.|~|Julia Case-Levine is a freshman from New York, N.Y. She can be reached at juliacc@princeton.edu. 
75581|~|Study abroad chronicles: journey over destination|~|   December 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|There’s a poem I always turn to before taking a trip somewhere: “Ithaka” by Constantine P. Cavafy. The poem presents a rethinking of “The Odyssey” by creating the  nostalgia Odysseus feels for his home but urging the reader to feel this nostalgia for the journey itself. “Keep Ithaka always in your mind/Arriving there is what you are destined for/But do not hurry the journey at all/Better if it lasts for years…” As I reflect on my study abroad experience, this is definitely the lesson I will take home: Wherever you go, whatever you do, cherish the journey over the destination. The months melt to weeks, which melt to minutes; every cool experience Princeton can offer will feel like it passed far too quickly. We are incredibly fortunate to have an ever-ready feast of domestic and international travel opportunities at our fingertips: study abroad, the International Internship Program, Breakout trips, classes with a fall or spring break trip, thesis funding, residential college trips to see Broadway shows, intensive language classes and more. There is no way to taste every piece of Princeton fruit, but there is a way to spend more time admiring the existence of the tree. For those of you weighing whether to study abroad, I encourage you to strongly consider it. Experiencing another university’s academic system and social setting not only complements the Princeton experience but also enhances it. There is much about the University I didn’t appreciate until leaving, and I have even more enthusiasm about coming back. We only have one chance at an undergraduate experience, so why not essentially double it by sampling life at a different university? Some argue that Princeton is such a unique, precious opportunity that going away for a semester or a year is wasteful. In missing a semester, however, I have refueled the freshman fire of curiosity and excitement that is too easily doused by junior year. But this column isn’t only about studying abroad. This is about reminding ourselves to prize the journey over the destination — whether it’s through a study abroad program or an average Thursday on Nassau Street. This sentiment extends beyond sparkly travel opportunities; it is equally relevant to our days on campus. We can begin treating our New Jersey days as journeys, as if Princeton is a sort of globe. It is easy to go through the week and see the weekend as the destination, go through a reading with dinner after as the destination, go through a problem set with sleep as the destination, go through a class with the distribution requirement as the destination or go through a day wishing it would end. We all have those days and those classes and those problem sets. We don’t have to enjoy every minute of every lecture. I don’t. We do, however, have the opportunity to make the best of it. I have learned to treasure my days abroad — not only because of fresh classes or the refreshing campus culture but simply because it’s a happier, healthier outlook. I read “Ithaka,” as always, before boarding the plane to London, and I’m going to read it as I return to Princeton. It’s easy to mistake Princeton-as-destination as the dream fulfilled when education-as-destination gives us the mindset that our Princeton experience is a journey in itself.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

75568|~|A case for cultural competency training |~|   December 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jonathan Lu|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|At the Council of the Princeton University Community meeting on Monday, University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 led a conversation on the measures that the University can take to curb the racism experienced by students of color on a daily basis. Several students challenged Eisgruber to make a statement on the set of student proposals, which include required cultural competency training for all faculty; additional distribution requirements on identity and diversity; and conversion of African American Studies, African Studies, Latino Studies and Latin American Studies into majors. Eisgruber’s main response was that such measures should not pass without a decision made by the faculty. He was concerned that these might impinge on the faculty’s right to academic freedom, a key consideration given our University’s emphasis on intellectual thought. I won’t speak to the suggested changes to the Princeton curriculum, but I argue that cultural competency training and the University’s values as a liberal arts institution are by no means mutually exclusive. As defined by the National Education Association, “Cultural competence is having an awareness of one’s own cultural identity and views about difference and the ability to learn and build on the varying cultural and community norms of students and their families. It is the ability to understand the within-group differences that make each student unique while celebrating the between-group variations that make our country a tapestry. This understanding informs and expands teaching practices in the culturally competent educator’s classroom.” Cultural competency training would probably take the form of an orientation program or session. Hospitals and education organizations constantly draw on trainings of this nature in order to provide effective services. Eisgruber framed the call for required cultural competency training as an attempt to mandate civility in intellectual discourse. This would censor faculty from making potentially offensive arguments or claims. However, it isn’t clear that cultural competency conflicts. By definition, cultural competence relates to human-human interactions, such as teaching, as opposed to the material being taught. Students and faculty can still engage with racist texts and stereotyped theories — what matters is how faculty interact with students while engaging with this material. Cultural competence does not delegitimize material; instead, it emphasizes communication. Cultural competency training — as well as the other proposals for legitimizing diverse perspectives — is, in addition to being a means to support students of color, also a means to improve student education as a whole. In that sense, it is completely in alignment with the University’s academic values. Cultural competency stems from a philosophy of cross-cultural communication and diverse ways of knowing. As an example: Young, white Teach For America teachers teaching low-income minority students in New Orleans often have trouble teaching because they fail to recognize their students’ cultural backgrounds as legitimate. The way that knowledge is delivered is flawed — it becomes a static object for teachers, the power-holders, to impart onto their students. A better teaching style recognizes the diverse resources among students themselves and elevates students to scholars who theorize. This doesn’t ruin the professor’s authority or respect. Rather, cultural competency emphasizes students’ legitimate stake in questioning and engaging with the material. Cultural competency can be labeled “civility,” but it really is about improved communication and critical thought. Thus, it clearly satisfies the University’s values because it improves the quality of undergraduate teaching and education. One professor in the audience voiced concerns about the effectiveness of such training. She stated that she had attended an LGBT competency training earlier this year that provided her with no useful knowledge on how to better communicate with her students of such identities. To be sure, cultural competency trainings must be rigorous and immediately practical. Such training definitely exists: Professionals in health care, primary and secondary education and social work constantly draw upon this training when working with individuals of different backgrounds. Thus, concerns about effectiveness should inform, not impede, the planning of cultural competency training. Finally, Eisgruber shied away from creating a “litmus test” for how committed faculty are to supporting students of color. Namely, if the training had an opt-out option, students might end up labeling faculty who opt out as culturally insensitive. This speaks to two necessities. First, the training should be mandatory, as diversity training is for any residential college adviser. Second, training should be so effective and worthwhile that the only legitimate reason to object to it is to, indeed, be culturally insensitive. Most importantly, as advocates emphasize, students of color at the University experience an ingrained, institutional racism that perpetrators are unable to recognize. Therefore, we should err on the side of too much change rather than not enough. Required cultural competency training represents a step in the right direction, and I’m glad that Eisgruber and his cabinet have agreed to take on cultural competency training. But as everyone at the CPUC meeting agreed, such a proposal is far from enough. Both professors and, even more so, students need to stay open and engage with those of different backgrounds. The institution should work with student organizations to support this by creating spaces where students from all different backgrounds can interact and learn from each other. We have the Fields Center, the Women’s Center and the LGBT Center; we have hosted events and panels. But it’s not enough. The conversations that happen in these spaces need to go beyond — to the general University community. We need to engage with and benefit from the diversity within our University. Cultural competency training is but one step in that direction.|~|Jonathan Lu is a freshman from Fremont, Calif. He can be reached at jhlu@princeton.edu. 
75579|~|Let's talk about 'Tiger Microaggressions'|~|   December 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|On Dec. 5, a few Princeton students revived an old Facebook page that started last semester called “Tiger Microaggressions.” The purpose of the page is to call out the microaggressions Princeton students face on a daily basis in an anonymous and safe way. The term “microaggression” in its modern use was popularized by Columbia professor Derald Sue to refer to “brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative racial slights and insults toward people of color.” It has now been generalized to include other minorities as well. Calling out these microaggressions could be hugely beneficial for Princeton’s campus. Unfortunately, the current page is severely undermining its own cause by mixing the harmless with the offensive. Most of the microaggressions featured on the page are screenshots from Yik Yak, the popular social media app that essentially allows you to send anonymous tweets to others in your immediate vicinity. Those messages, called “yaks,” are then voted on by other users. The tone taken on the app is generally very lighthearted, but the anonymity gives some users the ability to make racist or sexist comments that they would not admit to offline. Tiger Microaggressions has highlighted some of these. For example, a recent post featured a yak that responded to the recent election of Ella Cheng ’16 as USG president with, “Not only do we have a female president … She’s Asian too … Could this get any worse?” This yak clearly targets Cheng on the basis of her gender and race. It is aggressive and uncalled for. However, the potency of such yaks is severely diluted when other less inflammatory statements are presented on the same page in the same manner. Let’s look at another election yak featured on the page. Someone posting as “#thanksella” yakked, “Just ate an unripe fruit.” This one is clearly a reference to Cheng’s opponent Will Gansa ’17 and his popular campaign promise to personally ripen all campus fruit. Although it does lightheartedly target Cheng, it is clearly because of a desire to support Gansa, rather than to comment on any part of Cheng’s identity. Unless any support for Gansa must be considered racist and sexist, I personally don’t see how this can be a microaggression. There are two obvious solutions for this problem. First, whoever is running the group can be very careful about which stories and screenshots are featured on the page. As a minority student on campus, I do want people to be aware of my experience and the things that can make students like me feel unwelcome. However, I do not want these concerns showcased alongside harmless jokes as though the two are in any way comparable. Another possible tactic is simply to post explanations of why each story or screenshot was chosen. If the purpose of the page is to educate people about the experiences of minority students on campus, then there should be some sort of discussion. Obviously, presenting the stories without context is powerful and, in particularly egregious cases, it serves to raise awareness by showing the blatant racism and misogyny that still exists on this campus. However, in cases in which the offensive nature is less than obvious, the lack of context only serves to confuse. A reader is left wondering why the post is considered a microaggression, which is harmful because some might come to the conclusion that microaggressions simply do not exist and that minority students are only deliberately misconstruing certain jokes. I am not claiming that the posts whose inclusion I do not understand are all 100 percent innocuous, but that is how I see them. Perhaps there is a very strong reason for the inclusion of the “Just ate an unripe fruit” post, but personally, I will never know it. I know that I could simply ask a question in the comments. However, questions to minorities are often, no matter how sincerely they are meant, met with a request to “educate yourself.” As a minority, I do understand that answering questions about your identity can get wearying, but with neither an explanation for the posts nor a valid outlet for discussion, a page like Tiger Microaggressions is not meeting its full potential.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va.

75439|~|Michael Brown should not be the face of our protests|~|   December 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|African-Americans suffer severe discrimination from policemen and prosecutors, and I believe more University students should take an active role in fighting it. But I did not participate in the walkout last Thursday, because I am not angry at the grand jury’s verdict in the Michael Brown case. The grand jury’s decision to acquit Officer Darren Wilson was consistent with both the forensic evidence, which shows that Brown had scuffled with Officer Wilson and was moving toward him when shot, and the testimony of half a dozen African-American witnesses who appeared before the grand jury to corroborate Wilson’s account of events. The grand jury also heard testimony from witnesses who claimed that Brown was attempting to surrender, but their accounts conflicted with each other. The Washington Post, a newspaper not known for a conservative bias, reports that these conflicts made it “difficult to parse who saw what and who saw anything at all,” adding that eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable. Further, their testimony that Brown was shot in the back does not stand up to the blood spatter evidence or the analysis of the bullets’ trajectory. In spite of all the evidence supporting Officer Wilson, the student walkout participants chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” to affirm Brown’s alleged passivity and staged a 45-minute “die-in” to protest the four-and-a-half hours that Brown’s body spent lying on the street. But police negligence was not a factor in that long delay. Rather, Brown’s body could not be moved until evidence had been collected from the scene, and St. Louis County detectives on duty were responding to a gun threat at a hospital that morning. Because lives were still in potential danger, the investigators had to conclude that the hospital was reasonably secure before starting their thirty-minute drive to Ferguson. By the time they arrived there, the crowd had already grown violent. According to a St. Louis County newspaper, “commanders in charge stopped the investigation at points and directed investigators to seek cover” because protesters were throwing objects and screaming, “Kill the police.” It was the crowd’s violence, not police negligence, that dragged the investigation out for so long. I normally imagine students here to be informed when they speak vocally on an issue, so I am disappointed by our community’s distortion of the timeline and insistence on ignoring physical evidence in favor of the witnesses who tell the story we have decided to hear. But I am mostly disappointed because the Brown case is a bad example for the real and awful racial bias that minority communities face in the American law enforcement system. According to the Black Agenda Report, 60 percent of incarcerated Americans are racial and ethnic minorities. This reflects a systemic police and prosecution bias, not a higher propensity to commit crimes. For example, the same report notes that African-Americans “are 13 percent of America’s population and 14 percent of the nation’s drug users but are 37 percent of persons arrested for drugs and 56 percent of the inmates in state prisons for drug offenses.” Many people have lost their liberty to this bias, and some have lost their lives. Take the case of Eric Garner, whose death at the hands of police officers was captured on video. Garner was resisting arrest, but nonviolently, when Officer Daniel Pantaleo grabbed him in a chokehold. Officer Pantaleo was not trying to kill Garner, but the NYPD had banned chokeholds like his for a reason — they kill people. Officer Pantaleo ignored Garner’s repeated cries of “I can’t breathe” for 19 seconds, and Garner ultimately died. A grand jury failed to indict the officer. The Garner case is a clear example of unjustified force that led to death of a black male. It played a small role in Thursday’s walkout, but only as an afterthought. (The grand jury did not reach its decision until after the walkout had been planned.) Instead, the face of the protest here was Michael Brown, and he is dividing campus rather than joining us together. Using the Brown case to evoke an emotional response to race relations is a two-way street. Those who are upset about the events will press for change, but many people who are not sympathetic to Brown will not be sympathetic to the larger cause. I have spoken to students who either do not acknowledge law enforcement’s racial bias or do not understand its extent. In their minds, the problem cannot be too bad if our best example exalts a criminal who fought an officer for his gun and presented a real threat to his life. For readers who believe this way, I implore you: Look beyond the Brown case. Look at the data at large, and look at Garner. For readers who are already angry, please, let us choose a less polarizing face for our protests so that we can unite more people in the struggle toward racial equality.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn.

75453|~|Guilty until proven innocent|~|   December 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Coy Ozias|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Christian conservatives on the far right from the late Baptist minister Jerry Falwell to Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska, have been working to curtail sex on college campuses since the 1960s, with few results. But the liberal, feminist campaign against sexual assault has had more of the staunching effect on college students’ sexual behavior. For decades, the Christian right has preached biblical admonitions condemning premarital sex. Purity rings, exhortations about STDs and a push for abstinence have long been conservatives’ siren calls to hormone-laden college students. It does not appear that this group has been influenced by conservatives’ message. The Obama administration, along with women’s rights organizations and anti-patriarchal groups, have been a vocal force against campus sexual assaults. These groups say that 20 percent of female college students have been sexually assaulted. They demand that colleges take measures to end these attacks. The Obama administrations has ordered colleges to beef up their policies for punishing sexual misconduct or risk losing federal funding. Under Title IX, colleges have been compelled by the Obama administration to adopt adjudication processes that are meant to replace the criminal justice system. Under this new process, schools are required to use a “preponderance of evidence” standard to determine the alleged guilt of an offender in cases of sexual assault. This standard of proof is much easier to reach than the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard, the highest standard of proof and the one used in criminal cases. The University resisted to lower its own standard from “clear and persuasive” until last month, after it was charged with violating Title IX and agreed to accept the preponderance of evidence standard. Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer for several male students who have been accused of sexual assault, stated that “schools [are] treating young men as presumptively guilty, while bowing to pressure from the national dialogue.” Under these new University rules, men are guilty until proven innocent. Sexual assault and rape are wrong. Perpetrators should be punished. But the adjudication process should be fair for the accused as well as the victims. What is happening now is that many male students who thumbed their noses at the Christian right’s warnings of sin, disease, pregnancy and eternal damnation are now unsure and cowed about sexual contact with females because of these new University policies backed by the federal government. Normal, consensual, heterosexual sex on campus has become dangerous for males. The rule used to be “no means no.” That has changed. The new rule is “yes means yes.” The burden of “affirmative consent” has been placed solely on the male. A male must get consent from the female at every stage of their sexual encounter. However, even if he does get consent, he is still at risk if it is determined that the female was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Even if he himself is intoxicated, it is now his responsibility to assess the intoxication of his partner. The female has none of this responsibility. If a female says that she was raped or assaulted the next day, the male student can face expulsion, even if the sex was consensual and not forced. At Occidental College – according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a legal advocacy group representing a male student accused of sexual assault – a female student texted a male friend and asked him if he wanted to hook up. Both of them had been drinking. She next texted her female friends and told them she had the intention of having sex with him. Then, she texted the man and asked him if he had condoms. She met him. She willingly had sex. The next day, she accused him of rape. The male student was expelled from Occidental College. He was charged with violating Occidental’s “written incapacitation standard,” which says a female cannot make an informed and rational decision to engage in sexual activity if “she lacks conscious knowledge of the nature of the act or is physically helpless.” The police investigation determined that “[w]itnesses were interviewed and agreed that the victim and suspect were both drunk[.] [H]owever, … they were both willing participants exercising bad judgment[.] … It would be reasonable for [the male student] to conclude based on their communications and [the accuser’s] actions that, even though she was intoxicated, she could still exercise reasonable judgment.” This decision ended police involvement in the case. However, Occidental undertook its own investigation and found the male student “responsible” under the preponderance of evidence standard (a mere 50.01% certainty). FIRE Senior Vice President Robert Shibley said, “By classifying sex while drunk as rape and stripping students of due process protections, Occidental and the federal government have rendered vast numbers of students unwitting rapists — and ensured that being accused is nearly the same thing as being found guilty.” These cases have had a chilling effect on campus sexual behavior. Colleges need to take the protection of females on campus seriously. Colleges need to squash any form of rape culture. But males need to protect themselves as well. Will males begin to ask for written consent from potential female partners? Will they videotape this consent with a time stamp? Will male students ask females to take a breathalyzer test to ensure they are not incapacitated before having sex? Jerry Falwell abhorred the sexual revolution of the 1960s. As he looks down from the Big House in the sky at current University sexual policies of 2014, he is probably smiling.|~|Coy Ozias is a freshman from Christiansburg, Va.

75435|~|Unapologetically upset|~|   December 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Christian Wawrzonek wrote a column last week proposing that anger is a counterproductive response to bring to any campus discussion about gender issues. This was in reaction to the latest exposé of a blatantly sexist club culture at Tiger Inn. There is an almost wincing hesitation in his piece that made me initially reluctant to write a response: Anyone who publicly identifies himself among the “we” of a group on campus with a tendency to “shout down feminists” deserves an appreciative round of applause for broaching the issue in a mature and respectful way that nevertheless exposes him (as he knows all too well) to an onslaught of knee-jerk ad-hominem attacks. Still, he invited the shouted-down (and shouting) feminists to have a real conversation, so it’s only common courtesy to respond in kind. Several of Wawrzonek’s points indicate that after a thoughtful contemplation of gender issues, he still hasn’t quite grasped that foreign “female perspective” he describes so empathetically. Take his explanation of why men and women don’t see eye-to-eye on catcalling. In his adopted women’s shoes, he supposes that “having to deal with constant superficial attempts at flattery and kindness as attempts to gain sexual favors would become exhausting and annoying.” This is true, but so far from being the worst consequence of street harassment, that it is almost beside the point. Being called “sexy baby” on the street is not merely annoying because of its smarmy insincerity. It is a threat. If Wawrzonek had ever sat in a self-defense seminar where instructors advise him to carry a whistle wherever he goes, check behind his car before opening the door and always invite a trusted friend of the opposite gender on night walks, he would be much less likely to find sexualized comments from strangers neutral, flattering or casually irritating. They are a frustrating and too often frightening reminder that the object of the catcall is perceived as a vulnerable member of the “weaker sex.” Sometimes the threat is explicit and intended. Sometimes it’s buried under a veneer of misguided humor or friendliness. The message is always there. In attempting to disassociate catcalling from sexual assault, Wawrzonek misses the power dynamics guiding both. Sexual assault statistics make me feel insecure. So does the 20-year-old stranger making remarks about my appearance on the street corner. And yes, both make me angry. Which brings us to the other point I had trouble digesting in Wawrzonek’s column. He calls anger an unhelpful and self-perpetuating obstacle to real conversation on these issues. He asserts that given the dramatic differences in men and women’s experiences, “you can’t expect men to understand this disparity if many don’t even realize it exists.” He uses this understanding gap to explain why women should not let male insensitivity upset us. But I am upset, and I have not yet heard a compelling argument for reevaluating this reaction. I am upset that there are people (Wawrzonek’s division of feminists and anti-feminists along gender lines is utterly false) who fail to “understand” my experience of street harassment, and I am equally, if not more, upset that there are people who “don’t even realize it exists.” I don’t think this is an inappropriate or unproductive reaction. My anger is what motivates me to try to change the current social reality. Anger is what Wawrzonek is responding to in his piece. He may not like it, he may even feel repelled by it, but he acknowledges it and it’s making him join the conversation. True, flaring up when the man selling me tissues at the C-Store calls me “sweetie” is probably not helpful for the greater cause of equality. I recognize that and renew my resolution not to bite his nose off every time this occurs. Nose biting in general is a very poor tactic for spreading feminist gospel. Hearing about the sexist shenanigans on the TI listserv makes me want to scream with nauseous rage. There are multiple ways for me to channel this anger. Some are obviously unproductive. If I happen to lose my temper arguing over victim blaming with an insensitive acquaintance, I recognize that there is probably no constructive value to that interaction. The emotion behind the pointless shouting, however — that is what we cannot afford to lose. The day I can listen to a friend’s story of how she was sexually harassed in a club without feeling and expressing fury that we live in a society where this is “normal” is the day I stop fighting for a different kind of society. I suspect Wawrzonek agrees that the other society — the one where women enjoy equality, security and respect — is the ideal. In the interest of achieving it, I propose a deal: I’ll stop screaming if you stop telling me to calm down. And let the healing begin.|~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio.

75347|~|Waging a new type of war: a media war |~|   December 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|If you’re anything like me, then you like to get your news from the ranks of Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and “The Onion.” But I’m not the only one. For myriad people under the age of 30, Jon Stewart’s reliability as a news source is comparable to CNN, Fox News and NPR, and sadly, this comes as no surprise in an age where disillusionment with the media has plagued our generation. The recent barrage of reporting-gone-wrong has quite possibly marred the media’s credibility irrevocably. Media bias has become the norm with discernible bias in the entities interviewed, facts cited, headlines, scenes portrayed in photographs and trending hashtags. For example, #iftheygunnedmedown — that is, the social media campaign that raises the question, “If they gunned me down, what picture of me would the media show to the public?” was spurred by perceived media bias in the portrayal of Michael Brown in the media. It became a subject of contention in that the media chose a photograph of him in which he’s throwing up a peace sign, but which many would inevitably perceive as a gang sign. He had a plethora of everyday pictures, yet the media made the conscious decision of posting that one. Incensed masses took to Twitter, tweeting normal, innocuous pictures of themselves juxtaposed with pictures that could be interpreted as questionable, similar to the one of Michael Brown, with the hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown. Now compare the titles of different articles — CNN’s “Israel Shoots Palestinians” and the Associated Press’s “Palestinian kills baby at Jerusalem station.” The nuances of both titles present undeniable media bias toward either side of the Arab-Israeli conflict. While the U.S. media has historically cast greater credence to Israel, today the media has been casting greater credence to Palestine in the ongoing “media war,” according to Vox and as is evident by the recent allegations against AP of bias against Israel in its reporting. Then there’s simply biased reporting. As The Washington Post recounts, the writer of Rolling Stone’s piece about the alleged gang rape of a freshman specifically picked the University of Virginia and the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. Her rationale is entrenched in stereotype, purporting that the frat is “really emblematic in a lot of ways of sort of like elitist fraternity culture.” As writer Alexandra Petri pointed out in an article about the media’s newfound role in Ferguson, we need the media “to tell the story that does matter.” All of these stories undoubtedly matter, and the people behind these stories are fully cognizant of the impact and salience they carry, from institutionalized racism to a ceaseless, casualty-ridden conflict to sexual assault on college campuses. But often the media will disproportionately cover one event or news story more than other current events, inevitably grossly oversimplifying the story and allowing bias to permeate the reporting, as it did with both Ferguson and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ferguson certainly hasn’t been the only incident of arguably racial violence, and the atrocities committed by both Israel and Hamas aren’t singular incidents in the Middle East. The media should be an impartial, didactic force that seeks to pursue the truth, not to engender a twisted sense of ignorance. The media should more carefully scrutinize the picture of a victim that they are about to present. The media should be more judicious in titling articles. The media should realize that a certain degree of dubiety is necessary in trusting your sources and that corroborating your sources is crucial, even despite the interviewee’s will. But then again, maybe the solution lies in where we seek our news in the first place. Local investigative reporting is an underrated asset in news today. We should read from a wide array of news sources, both domestic and international. Nonetheless, while a third-party source may be ostensibly unbiased, such as the United States commenting on the Middle East, Western reporting has presented biases of its own. That being said, news necessitates objective reporting. Commentary and personal analysis are also integral to good journalism; that’s what op-eds and columns are for. Mainstream media, particularly Western media coverage of the news, needs greater accountability. The role of mainstream media should not be to change the way we think, but rather to give us the information we need so that we may choose how to think. It should not be to compel us to adopt the source’s viewpoint, but rather to allow us to formulate our own stance on the issues. The media is retrograding practically toward yellow journalism with sensationalist stories and unreasonably attention-grabbing headlines providing a biased, if not inaccurate, account. As the man infamously attributed to yellow journalism, William Randolph Hearst, said, “You furnish the pictures, and I’ll furnish the war.” And that is exactly the trend in the status quo — the media is furnished with pictures and stories, and in turn, they furnish conflict.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

75334|~|Who's to blame and why it matters|~|   December 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|When I first read the Rolling Stone article about rape at the University of Virginia, I was shocked and outraged, as most other readers were. Nearly unanimous national horror erupted at how UVA, which unfortunately is not unique in this matter, has handled sexual assault on campus. This outrage seemed to create enough pressure to finally spur significant changes. UVA temporarily closed fraternities as they pledged reform. Analyzing all of this alone would be enough fodder for a column: why did it take a gang rape to prompt the impetus for change, what are the right changes to make in response — both on campus and in legal procedures, etc. But the issue of sexual assault on campuses was quickly derailed. It soon became known that there were inconsistencies in the rape case in the article; the Rolling Stone editors and writers failed to do their required due diligence as journalists and confirm their interviewee’s story. Once again, I was shocked and outraged — not at Jackie, the story’s subject, but at Rolling Stone. Sexual assault is a major problem, especially on college campuses. Rolling Stone had the opportunity to draw attention to this and ignite some real change, but it squandered the chance. By not checking the accuracy of the story, Rolling Stone left the door wide-open for criticism, not just for itself but also for Jackie, all rape victims and all proponents for change. Given that people already question sexual assault victims’ reliability and the seriousness of their allegations, it should have been evident to Rolling Stone that it was imperative to get this story right. Otherwise, the consequences are just too devastating. Now, even if most of her story is accurate, sexual assault victims will be even more discouraged from coming forward and seeking justice. Even though the facts as they are now being presented appear to support that Jackie underwent some sort of sexual trauma, people will use the Rolling Stone article as fodder to discredit all sexual assault victims. Furthermore, blaming Jackie is unjust for a variety of reasons. It is a journalist’s responsibility to check the facts — especially those of a traumatized college student. Rolling Stone failed Jackie and its readers by not doing so. The reporter, Erdely, should have been upfront and honest with Jackie from the outset about Erdely’s responsibility to be able to confirm the facts, and she should not have interviewed Jackie if Jackie didn’t agree. Protecting Jackie means Rolling Stone should have checked her story and if fallout happened, as it did, Rolling Stone would need to take responsibility. Though statements by editors show they accept responsibility, the original official apology statement unfortunately seems to blame Jackie for being unreliable. At least after receiving criticism, Rolling Stone has updated its apology statement to state explicitly, “These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie.” As an advocate for sexual assault reform, I was devastated when I first read the Rolling Stone statement and all the news surrounding the inconsistencies. Based on what I’ve seen before, I figured this would most definitely set back the case for reform and return the discussion to victim-blaming. It’s been inspiring to see the overwhelming number of op-eds articulate why the blame falls on Rolling Stone and not on Jackie, arguing that we as a society should not let this unethical reporting stop the momentum for change. Even UVA has announced that despite the new revelations about the article, it will forge ahead with its planned reforms. Hopefully, this attitude will prevail. Nevertheless, the entire debate over who deserves the blame reminds me of recent conversations I’ve had on so many different issues. In the face of critics, whose responsibility is it to make a compelling case for social justice? These same questions arise in discussing issues such as divestment from Israel, women’s rights or affirmative action: To be an effective activist, do you have the right to be angry if you are wronged, or do you, despite this, have the onus to react calmly because that is probably more effective in persuading your opponents? Where you place either the blame or the onus and responsibility for change often seems to be at the heart of where people differ. While this difference may appear like a small nuance, it has huge implications in how one approaches any reform. Among the many instances where this matters was during the diversity panel last week. There were several problems with the argument presented by James Madison Program senior preceptor Russell Nieli GS ’79, including denying that racism still exists against all blacks, not just the poor. But one of the largest failings for me was his claim that because it’s possible that race-based affirmative action might lead to the affirmation of negative stereotypes, we shouldn’t practice it at all in admissions. But the onus to prevent any possible affirmation of negative stereotypes, thereby creating a welcomed, supported and diverse student body, falls on the University here, not on those who are subjected to these stereotypes. The other three panelists somewhat acknowledged this, and the last questioner hit the nail on the head. The University must support all its students fully and help everyone acknowledge the privilege they have to attend Princeton, thereby preventing people from believing these gross stereotypes. Where you put the onus might seem like a small difference, but it is an issue of ethics that ultimately must determine what policy to pursue. Be it affirmative action or sexual assault, I urge people to carefully consider who is to blame in all these various debates and what is the most effective strategy to achieve the ends you desire. This framing certainly does make a difference in where we go from here.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu.

75207|~|Princeton: Stop financing environmental destruction |~|   December 7 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|The University prides itself on being a leader in sustainability and environmental responsibility. From conducting groundbreaking green energy research to cutting waste in dining halls, the University has taken laudable steps toward a sustainable future. Despite these efforts, the University has failed to address a looming elephant in the room: our $21 billion endowment and the companies and practices that it funds. While the University does not disclose details about the composition of its investments, analysis of comparable endowments suggests that the University has around 4 percent of its investments in fossil fuels, not including companies responsible for other drivers of irreparable environmental harm. That is, the University provides an estimated one billion dollars in support of practices that counteract Princeton’s advances toward local and global sustainability. As a step toward resolving this regrettable inconsistency, a group of undergraduate and graduate students has prepared a proposal to incorporate environmental responsibility into the University’s management of its endowment. We intend to present this proposal to the Resources Committee – which evaluates proposed changes to University investment policy – in the near future. The Princeton University Sustainable Investment Proposal calls for greater accountability and the adoption of environmental standards in the management of the endowment. It provides a flexible and realistic framework for the development of environmentally and financially tenable investment strategies. The Sustainable Investment Proposal calls for the University to commit to the United Nations’ principles of sustainable investing, asks for an annual report documenting the environmental impacts of the University’s investments and outlines the steps by which Princeton can develop environmentally conscious investment practices. The crux of the proposal is the creation of a committee to evaluate Princeton’s current investment strategies and generate recommendations for financially and environmentally sustainable management. This committee will consist of democratically elected contingents of students, faculty, staff, members of the administration and members of the Resources Committee and the Princeton Investment Company. It may choose to engage with or shift investments away from companies with damaging practices such as fossil fuel extraction, deforestation and the distribution of anti-scientific climate misinformation; it may also choose to devote a portion of our investments to industries working towards green alternatives and ecological restoration. The committee’s recommendations will be applied to a subset of the endowment for a one-year trial period, after which they may be revised. Once finalized, these guidelines must be adopted by all of the University’s asset managers. Financing environmental destruction is an injustice that directly conflicts with the University’s stated core values. In its official Sustainability Plan, the University declares that it has an obligation to maintain environmental resources for both past and future generations, and investment in environmental degradation is a failure to adhere to this obligation. Moreover, it undermines Princeton’s standing as an institution committed to finding scientific and ethical solutions to pressing environmental concerns. The University has acted to align its investments with its values in the past: It officially ceased to invest in businesses involved in apartheid in South Africa and genocide in Darfur. In the current environmental crisis, it is both an unethical and a political act to continue to invest in the businesses whose practices are responsible for increasing food insecurity, water shortages, extreme weather events and ecological collapse. It is time that Princeton join the growing number of institutions, from Stanford University to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to the United Church of Christ, that have adopted principles of sustainable investment. The endowment is unlikely to be significantly affected by sustainable investment. Any change to investment strategy carries risk, but a growing body of evidence suggests that over the long term – as more companies enter the green energy market and governments take action on climate change – sustainable investment practices will carry great benefits. We recognize that short-term risks exist and that such benefits are uncertain, but we also must recognize that as the wealthiest university per student in the country, the University is uniquely able and obligated to take a bold step forward on sustainability. The University’s adoption of this proposal will have impacts that are both economic and symbolic. The growing student movement to address fossil fuel investments, most publicly in Stanford’s coal decision, has already turned heads. NRG Chief Executive Officer David Crane cited college activism when announcing his power company’s pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 90 percent by 2050. He told The New York Times, “I don’t relish the idea that year after year we’re going to be graduating a couple million kids from college, who are going to be American consumers for the next 60 or 70 years, that come out of college with a distaste or disdain for companies like mine.” Princeton can play a meaningful role in forcing a public shift towards sustainable solutions. The University community has already shown its commitment to sustainability, from the continued on-campus initiatives of groups like SURGE and Greening Princeton to the hundreds of Princetonians who attended the People’s Climate March in New York this September. Sustainable investment will be the logical and long overdue extension of our on-campus endeavors to include the endowment.

75209|~|Editorial: USG election lessons learned|~|   December 7 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|On Friday, nearly 2000 students voted to make Ella Cheng the next president of the Undergraduate Student Government. We, as an Editorial Board, endorsed Cheng and are pleased to congratulate her on her success in the election. We wish her the best of luck over the coming year. However, in addition to Cheng’s victory, we think this year’s elections have started conversations that are important to continue. The three presidential campaigns have asked us to consider how to promote women’s leadership, USG’s role on campus and the role of humor in our campus culture. For this, the Board would like to thank the three candidates that ran. If Cheng’s victory is the first thing that comes to mind in the wake of the election, the second thing is undoubtedly the impact of the Gansa campaign. Running as the only male candidate on a platform of waffle fries and dissatisfaction with USG, Gansa has become a polarizing figure on campus. To some, he is a symbol of dissatisfaction with the role of USG on campus. For others, he is a symbol of misogyny and the obstacles female candidates face when running for leadership positions both on and off campus. However, while many are keen to paint Gansa as an example of everything wrong with Princeton culture, we see him as a positive influence. He is a non-incumbent who chose to take his dissatisfaction with USG and channel it into action. While his campaign was centered on humor, he has highlighted real problems with the way USG communicates with the student body and the tendency for many students to feel as though they are not represented by student government. As a Board, we have consistently advocated for students to act on their convictions — and that is exactly what the Gansa campaign did. It takes courage to put oneself in the public eye instead of remaining part of the unactionable majority who complains about campus issues and institutions such as USG, sexual assault, lack of women’s leadership and more. While Gansa’s campaign may represent some of Princeton’s faults, it also represents many of the things that should be encouraged. However, Gansa is not the only one who deserves praise for taking action to tackle institutional issues. Both Cheng and Molly Stoneman were female candidates running in a race in which women have seldom been successful. Both women highlighted important issues in the Princeton community: Stoneman ran on a platform of women’s leadership and Cheng ran on a message of improving USG policy and communication. While the presence of two very qualified female candidates and Cheng’s ultimate victory will not end the gender imbalance that still plagues leadership at Princeton, it is an important step in the right direction that would not have been possible without the courage of both candidates. While Cheng does not begin her term until February, we hope that both she and the student body continue the conversations this election has started. We hope that, in addition to her own proposed policies, under Cheng’s leadership USG continues to work on women’s leadership initiatives like the ones Stoneman advocated for and the issues of incumbency and representation Gansa raised. This election is as much a triumph of Cheng’s ideas as it is a reminder of the other important issues that remain in our community. We hope that, under Cheng’s leadership, USG continues to work to lead the way.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief. 
75211|~|On anonymity and accountability|~|   December 7 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|Providing yet another piece of evidence for the thesis that there is a relevant XKCD strip for everything, an entry in the long-running webcomic depicts in its first couple panels two people engaged in an Internet comment war. In an unrealistic turn of events, a third person — an arbiter of sorts — flies to one of them and carries him all the way to the other. Finding themselves face to face, the two people have nothing to say to each other. The arbiter then flies the first person back to his chair, where he sits stunned, contemplating what just happened. This issue of the comic makes a valuable point: The computer can be a seemingly impenetrable barrier, a near-fully-protective line of defense against any affront or attack found online thanks to its culture of anonymity. Comments sections on blogs and news sites are typically full of people from all over the world commenting under a name which fully protects their identity. This can be a very good thing (namely, people who would feel uncomfortable expressing something under their real identity are given a chance to post from an anonymous perspective), but, by and large, this turns out to be a very bad thing. Freedom from repercussions can allow for wonderfully frank and personal comments from some, but it also allows for hateful, slanderous and venomous comments from others. I’m not going to argue for the destruction of anonymity in Internet commenting, because, firstly, that would be impossible to implement and, secondly, sometimes it’s a very good thing to say something potentially controversial without fear of attack. However, especially in light of recent tragedies inextricably intertwined with very touchy subjects like race and gender, the vitriol found in these Internet flame wars has seemed to increase drastically over the past few months. The comments become an endless circlejerk of both sides reaffirming their own opinion over and over again through the medium of, as XKCD so eloquently puts it, saying something over text that no one would ever say to their counterpart’s face. Furthermore, thanks to the near-total impunity associated with writing these comments, it’s almost impossible to actually confront an online opponent in a meaningful way. I’d like to be able to wave my magic wand and create some easy fix to the issue of meaningless and hateful conversations via Internet, but the only real solution comes on an individual level — commenters looking to improve the dialogue found online must practice what they preach. Taking down the culture of scathing exchanges requires everyone to put effort into considering the opposing viewpoint and where that view is coming from, then constructively breaking down why, exactly, people find that view to be incorrect. Christian Wawrzonek, in his column “Taking a breath, bridging the gap,” argues that in arguments about gender disparity, anger and dismissal stem from a fundamental misunderstanding about the different experiences a man and woman can have. As he puts it, “Becoming irritated by another person’s lack of understanding and responding with anger and criticism will solve nothing. If something does not make sense to people and the primary argument they hear is criticism of their lack of understanding, the response naturally will be more anger and frustration.” I’d like to be able to extend this logic to Internet-based comments. If we’re not actively being constructive — whether refusing to acknowledge we might be wrong or refusing to give someone else’s argument a fair chance — then we are contributing to a toxic environment. Accountability won’t automatically make our commenting habits more constructive or thoughtful, but it’s a step in the right direction. At the risk of feeding into the pro-Prince/anti-Prince circlejerk, I like that the newspaper’s code of ethics means I have to comment under my real name. When I’m held to my word, I feel obligated to present myself in a way I would want others to perceive me in real life. Accountability, at least for me, improves the comments I leave — I put more thought into my arguments and wording when responding to someone on our Disqus feed, even if they happen to be commenting anonymously. It’s yet to be seen if Internet flame wars would lighten or become less vitriolic if we as a society were to force commenters to use their real names (and therefore be responsible for what they say), and it’s likely we will never find out. However, there is so much anger in the anonymous facets of our society, and it’s impossible to say whether the detestation will ever subside. Change needs to come from every individual commenter, and though I don’t denounce hiding behind a generic username, I implore those ready to leave a hateful comment to think twice. If we can reframe our thoughts in a way which encourages nuanced, thorough discussion, then the Internet will be a safer and more satisfying place.|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

75183|~|An open letter to the Tiger Inn Graduate Board |~|   December 5 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|We are alumni of the Princeton University and Tiger Inn classes of 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, which were among the first cohorts that included women. We are writing to express our dismay and disgust over the behavior of club leaders and members over the past year, including the incident in the spring that resulted in damage to the clubhouse, as well as the more recent and disturbing incidents in which club officers engaged in misogyny, sexual harassment or worse. Although we were in the first few classes that included women —  and, indeed, women made up only a small percentage of each class  —  this was not our experience of Tiger Inn. Once it was determined that TI was legally required to admit women, it seemed that it was only older alumni who occasionally made disparaging remarks about the newly co-ed status of the club. Club members —  female and male  —  enjoyed the camaraderie, mutual respect and low-key atmosphere for which TI was known. It is therefore shocking to read about the recent behavior by club members, more than 20 years after the club began admitting women, and eight years after the club confronted allegations of sexual assault and suffered repercussions as a consequence. The majority of current club members were not alive during the period when TI was all-male, so it seems particularly bizarre, offensive and disheartening to read that some members may be wishing for a bygone era. It indicates a club culture that is unwelcoming and dangerous and has no place anywhere, let alone in the privileged confines of Princeton. The 2012 documentary “The Invisible War” about sexual assaults in the military cites a statistic that in military units where sexual harassment was tolerated, rapes tripled. These attitudes and actions by TI members should not be allowed to persist. While the Graduate Board appears to be taking these matters very seriously, and we appreciate the strong language that was used in the recent email to members, as reported by The Daily Princetonian, we are concerned that the actions taken so far  —  namely, the dismissal of club officers from their posts  —  are insufficient to alter the club’s culture and seem like half-measures at best. Such actions are similar to the responses of officials to incidents of sexual harassment and assault at the nearly 90 colleges and universities under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. The result has been a failure to make meaningful changes until a scandal occurs. To the Graduate Board, we would ask the following question: Should TI be permitted to remain open for the time being? If it should, under what conditions? We do not believe that this should be taken for granted, and we encourage the Graduate Board to consider all options for addressing the situation, which recent reports indicate it is doing. In light of the incidents this year —  and in light of the fact that one set of officers was forced out, only to be replaced by another set of officers who exhibited even worse judgment —  we believe that the prevailing culture of the club does not appear to live up to the standards of either the club or the University. Rather than hoping to address this through the least amount of punishment, the Graduate Board would do better to start from the other direction and consider whether the club should continue operating at the present time and, if so, what conditions the club and its members should be required to meet. Several individual alumni who have signed this letter intend to follow up directly with the Graduate Board with suggestions. As is often the case in situations involving groups, we would expect that there are many ethical members who will suffer the repercussions of the actions of others. The club will need to start valuing the example and leadership of such members before it can regain the spirit and integrity that are much beloved by alumni, including us. We are reluctant to associate ourselves with the club at this time, and we hope the Graduate Board makes a strong statement to the club’s past, current and future members about TI’s values. The Tiger Inn has an opportunity to demonstrate meaningful and potentially far-reaching leadership by addressing these recent issues in a manner that is direct, uncompromising and transparent to its alumni, the Princeton University community and the community beyond. The privilege and advantages that are bestowed upon students attending Princeton University cannot be overstated, and this fact needs to be acknowledged. If members of the Tiger Inn and its Graduate Board take swift and strong action to demonstrate that any kind of bias, harassment, exploitation or assault will not be tolerated, perhaps the current club culture can be reshaped into something worthy of the unique privilege that Princeton University students enjoy. Such actions will not erase the shameful events that have occurred recently at Tiger Inn, but anything less is not worthy of the Tiger Inn or of Princeton University.

75101|~|Get angry|~|   December 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Prianka Misra|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|On my way back from former President Jimmy Carter’s lecture, I spotted an abnormally rotund crow perched on top of the University Chapel. It was so large that a group of students had gathered to gawk at it. “It’s too big to fly away,” someone said to me. It stood there, repeatedly screeching its ugly, guttural caw as I walked toward Frist Campus Center. In the context of the bleak day, it reminded me of a death bell, ringing over and over again. In light of recent events, campus protests and public statements made by many of my peers, I have been impressed by the number of students who have highlighted the importance of recognizing that racial tensions and aggressions — in the University and the United States at large — still haunt us today. I appreciate the anger that I see every day on my news feed. I applaud those who continue to challenge our University’s administration on the matter of race relations on campus, especially in light of what I view to be an embarrassment of a diversity panel. But for those of you who are discussing this but not taking action, talking about these issues is simply not enough. While I feel that dialogue is important and essential to informing University students about the realities of being non-white (or holding other or multiple marginalized identities) here, I feel that we need to ask for more — more from each other and from the administration. The word “diversity” will only exist in quotes at the University until I can actually name more than two faculty members of my race. As a junior majoring in the Wilson School, I have had one black professor and one Latina professor during my time at Princeton. The rest have been white. The word “diversity” will mean nothing to me as long as I feel uncomfortable entering or getting a meal at a number of eating clubs here, solely because of how I look or the type of clothes I wear (read: brown and not Vineyard Vines). The word “diversity” will be a farce when women are ridiculed and hold leadership positions that are not as publicly prominent or influential as those that men hold. Diversity exists in many forms — socioeconomic, racial, gender, sexual. We must call attention to how many forms have not been integrated into our campus. With regard to faculty, I urge the administration to find faculty members of color in each department. Sure, there are South-Asian faculty members in the computer science department, but what about the Wilson School? While some might argue that there isn’t a great diversity of ethnic representation in certain departments to begin with (for example, Asian-Americans in the humanities), I would push back to say that this simply fuels the problem. Students are less likely to pursue an academic interest if they don’t see a role model in their professor. Role models aren’t solely based on race, but when you don’t see anyone in your department who looks like you, you begin to ask yourself if you’re doing something wrong. With regard to students, I urge women on campus to care and rise up about the widespread lack of acknowledgement of blatant acts of sexism as they do about racial injustice. Women, protest the fact that your eating club hasn’t seen a female president since god-knows-when. Protest the fact that you are seen not as an executive nor a chair, but a secretary. Go to Women’s Center events. Ask yourself why your male counterpart imagines himself a cowboy, a jedi, a workout bro, a fifteenth-century A.D. ottoman aristocrat, while you, a woman at the top university in the nation, are designated a “slut” or a “ho,” night after night. It’s not just a joke if you’re the one being laughed at every single time. To stop this, women need to hold more positions of power — in eating clubs, in the Undergraduate Student Government, in every aspect of campus life. We need to urge more women to run for election, and stop effeminizing certain lower-tier positions. And the responsibility to act certainly doesn’t just rest on women. Often, the most poignant messages of feminism are spoken by male voices — men urging their friends, peers and leaders to understand the urgency of this problem and to become allies and unabashed activists of this movement. The scope of activism that we need at Princeton is in no way limited to what I’m suggesting. However, there is a multitude of problems here that we need to continue to work on. For those of us who care about these issues deeply enough to work beyond dialogue and into activism, the protests, social media outbursts and other forms of campaigning cannot end. Get angry, folks. It’s time we catch up with 2014.|~|Prianka Misra is a Wilson School major from from Castro Valley, Calif. She can be reached at pmisra@princeton.edu. 
75050|~|Editorial: Expand Wintersession|~|   December 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|Last year, the Undergraduate Student Government organized Wintersession, a new program during Intersession in which students can take courses taught by other students and representatives from certain University resource centers, such as Career Services, with topics ranging from “Rubik’s Cube for Beginners” to “Intro Bulgarian.” The program was immensely popular, with over 1,300 students participating in 69 different courses. USG will be offering it again this Intersession. However, despite the success of Wintersession last year, the University lags behind some of our peer institutions in offerings during similar breaks in their academic calendars. The Editorial Board recommends that the University, particularly the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students, take a larger role in the administration of Wintersession to build on USG’s success and create a more robust Intersession program that is expanded to include courses and trips with University faculty and alumni. Programming of some sort during Intersession is important because it is a great opportunity for students to use the break between finals and the spring semester to learn new skills or explore interesting topics while they are on campus relaxing before classes resume, doing research for independent work or training for athletic teams. In order to expand the program, the University could learn from its peer institutions that have established programs similar to Wintersession. During the week before spring classes begin at Harvard, their Office of Student Life sponsors a wide range of classes, workshops and trips offered by Harvard alumni, graduate schools and student organizations, ranging from a trip to the United Nations to SCUBA certification, or a day at Harvard Law School. During their winter break in January, MIT offers a month-long Independent Activities Period during which students can take take advantage of short courses on various topics throughout the break. Expanding Wintersession to include more offerings similar to the Harvard and MIT programs would only be possible if it was run by ODUS, because USG simply does not have the resources or budget to expand Wintersession and should not use all of its resources on it. An ODUS-run Wintersession would allow students to have a wider range of Intersession opportunities beyond the current USG program. Putting the weight of the University behind the program could help organizers (which should still include USG and members of the student body) do things such as fund and arrange subsidized trips to New York or Philadelphia, or work with the Alumni Association to bring alumni to campus (or students to alumni) to facilitate courses or workshops focused on career preparation in various fields. Willing faculty members could offer short courses in topics that interest them or skills that they have, and they could also collaborate within their departments to offer courses or workshops that could introduce underclassmen to the department as part of the Major Choices initiative. ODUS could also expand partnerships with University organizations like Career Services, Campus Recreation and the Pace Center to offer more resume building and career planning workshops, sports leagues and athletic classes, or community service opportunities near campus. While some of these additions to Wintersession might be possible in subsequent years if it is run by USG, having ODUS run it would create the best Wintersession possible, with the most benefit for students and the University community because it would result in more resources dedicated to the program. Through a partnership between ODUS, USG and Princeton’s faculty, alumni and various centers and offices, the University could create a campus-wide Wintersession that could be a defining experience for University students by allowing them to explore new skills and subjects, as well as preparing themselves for their life after they graduate. Harvard and MIT have shown the feasibility of large winter break programs and the possibilities they offer students. The University should follow suit and create an even better program for its students during Intersession.|~|

75052|~|Changing USG election penalties|~|   December 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|With the amount of attention this election cycle has received recently, it seemed like a prudent idea to jump on the bandwagon and look into it myself. Although the platforms of the candidates, especially in the race for Undergraduate Student Government president, have been thoroughly examined (and which, to my chagrin, can be largely summed up with a few choice two-worders like “waffle fries,” “ripe fruit” and “bike reform”), very little light has been shed on the infractions that each candidate committed during the course of the campaign period. An email sent out by current USG president Shawon Jackson ’15 on Nov. 26 actually contained a link to the penalty points incurred by each candidate thus far – not surprising, only four of 28 candidates actually lost points, and none of the violations exceeded 10 points. But these numbers were, by themselves, relatively meaningless. So, at the suggestion of a friend, I looked at the USG Elections Handbook. As stated in section nine, candidates are allowed 19 free points before punitive sanctions are enacted. After racking up between 20 and 30 points, candidates lose the privilege to use “electronic campaigning messages,” and between 30 and 40 points, candidates can’t campaign online altogether, with the exception of their website. Between 40 and 50 points, candidates lose their right to have a website, and at 50 points a candidate is disqualified from the race outright. When asked, elections manager Amara Nnaeto ’17 stated that these policies have been in place since before her time (and, apparently, since before the time of anyone currently in the USG senate). As such, the rationale behind these policies is left up to personal interpretation. Ostensibly, they were intended to allow candidates wiggle room in the event of genuinely accidental mishaps that could occur during the lengthy campaigning process. At the same time, they seem to encourage knowledgeable, premeditated violations of the rules. If candidates are allowed 20 “grace points,” they can easily “accidentally” plaster up 9 posters in the predefined prohibited areas, incur the 18 penalty points (2 points per poster), yet still face no real action from the elections oversight manager. Given that over 85 percent of the candidates were able to get through the campaigning period without violating a single rule, and thus managed to stay at zero points throughout, it certainly seems doable. Understandably, the candidates, being honorable Princetonians, would probably try their best to avoid acting so calculating simply out of personal integrity (seeing as they probably didn’t have to sign the Honor Code before the election began). But, in the off chance that a candidate accrues enough points, the penalties seem oddly misaligned. For instance, no matter how candidates may rack up their first 20 points, they will lose the right to utilize electronic messages, such as email and Facebook messages. If, hypothetically, candidates covered up four or more of their competitors’ posters, incurring 5 points along the way with each instance, the penalty that results would have nothing to do with the type of infraction that candidate violated. Given this situation, it seems high time for USG to implement a systemic elections-process overhaul. The candidate races — especially the heated presidential contest — have shed light on the issues that the student body deems important (or not), but to make the elections process itself more efficient, fluid and effective, it might behoove USG to begin changing its approach. First and foremost, instead of a penalty system that basically encourages violations to a defined threshold, all student participants should be held accountable for knowing the entirety of the expectations held of them as legitimate candidates who have perused the Elections Handbook in its entirety. Moreover, infractions should not be penalized by a points system; instead, the USG elections manager should have greater discretion to discipline candidates in a per-case basis, which would ensure that the punishments that are delivered actually reflect the infraction. The candidates, their speeches and their platforms are undeniably the highlight of the election period. However, it is important to remain cognizant of the fact that, behind any good election is a framework driven by seemingly inconsequential logistics. However, it is this system of rules that ensures all candidates an equal opportunity to campaign. When there are archaic policies with ambiguous rationale that have been implemented since before anyone on the current leadership can recall, a reorganization is in order.|~|Jason Choe is a sophomore from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

74841|~|At Tiger Inn, women are the punch line |~|   December 3 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Alexandra Scheeler ’11 What do Ivy members and tampons have in common? That was the question printed on T-shirts designed by my eating club, Tiger Inn, in honor of the TI-Ivy Olympics my senior year. The answer, though, not written on the shirts, was: Both are stuck-up cunts. Olympics T-shirts made by the two rivals tend to rib jovially about club stereotypes — TI is full of meatheads, Ivy Club is full of snobs, at least we’re not in Cottage Club — nothing too serious or pointed, so I was surprised when I heard the plan for that year’s design. “Cunt” is not just a vulgar term; it’s a sexist term. Calling a woman a cunt is a way to dismiss her agency and individuality by reducing her to her gender. The T-shirt was supposed to make fun of Ivy members, so why did I feel like I was the punch line? I brought my concerns to the officers. I questioned their decision-making process and explained why I felt that “cunt” was a derogatory term that reflected poorly on the club. I pointed out that they would never imagine using a racial slur as a punch line. In response, I was told that I was being insensitive for drawing a parallel between the black and female struggles for equality. The T-shirts weren’t going to change. I was told that I should lighten up, that I shouldn’t take it too seriously — after all, it was just a joke. It was meant as a joke. I don’t think the officers, who remain my close friends, or the membership intended to demean women with those T-shirts. But they should have taken my concerns more seriously. What began as an ignorant and tasteless joke became a real problem when, after hearing a woman’s perspective, they then displayed a willful lack of empathy and understanding. Only about 10 TI members — all women as far as I can remember — refused to wear the shirt on the day of the Olympics. Most members slipped them on without a second thought. During the following Bicker cycle, the first anonymous joke that was read out to the assembled members went: “What do Ivy members, tampons and Alex Scheeler have in common?” I was motivated to write about this experience after reading about the far more troubling emails from former TI officers Adam Krop ’15 and Andrew Hoffenberg ’15 excerpted in The New York Times on Monday. I am encouraged to hear that they have been removed from their positions, but I want to make clear that this is not a case of a few bad actors in an otherwise functional system. A fundamental change must take place in the club’s culture. A culture that is demeaning to women can exist without anyone maliciously intending to demean women. It happens when female voices are ignored, ridiculed and told repeatedly that “it’s just a joke.” It happens when club-wide emails bemoan the burden of gender equality and encourage members to boo Sally Frank ’80. Women shouldn’t be a punch line, and I don’t want TI to be a punch line when we talk about sexism at the University. I am not advocating a politically correct police state. I joined TI for its rowdy, laid-back atmosphere and I want to preserve that sense of irreverence, but sexism cannot be its essential ingredient. Suits and Sluts, Cowboys and Sluts, Fifteenth-Century A.D. Ottoman Aristocrats and Sluts — this trope is tired and lame as well as sexist. We need to recognize that when jokes repeatedly and consistently mark women as second-class members, they are no longer funny. I loved my time at TI. I hope current and former members understand that my intention is not to shame the club, but to encourage members to speak up and advocate for an inclusive and affirming community, rather than shrugging off recent events as jokes or isolated incidents. Electing a female president would be a great place to start.|~|Alexandra Scheeler ’11 was a TI member from 2009-2011. She is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in religion at Harvard.

74836|~|Taking a breath, bridging the gap|~|   December 3 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|I’m going to take a huge risk here and attempt to discuss an issue that could arguably end in my mutilation. In the wake of Title IX, Shirtgate, catcalling videos and the newly renamed “Rape Haven” formerly known as the Tiger Inn, there has recently been a lot of discussion both on and off campus about the issue of gender equality. As a heterosexual, cis, white male from an upper middle class household, I’m pretty much the authority on discrimination and adversity, right? Perhaps not, but I do try to sympathize and understand the situation as best I can. Obviously, this is an extremely volatile topic, and the anger and outrage underlying these kinds of issues is ineffectual and ultimately counterproductive to resolving these conflicts. I hope we all recognize that Matt Taylor, a man willing to shed tears of apology on national television over a shirt, never had malicious intentions. This is not to say that what he did was right or wrong, but rather there is serious disparity between how men and women view the situation. If there is a legitimate disconnect in understanding, anger will not correct this disparity. Instead, we should understand that men and women’s experiences are different and focus on understanding that the criticisms are based on a narrow perception of the situation. Anger only serves to fuel the perception that the other side is simply uneducated and misguided. Let’s return now to the issue of catcalling. What is the fundamental difference in perception in this case? If you ask a man, “how would you like it if I called you ‘sexy baby’ on the street?” most men, myself included, wouldn’t care in the slightest. In fact, I would probably accept it as a compliment. But why? Why do men and women experience this so differently? Often, men use superficial flattery or kindness as a means to an end. I can imagine that, as a woman, this persistent barrage of compliments would eventually seem shallow and empty. Having to deal with constant superficial attempts at flattery and kindness as attempts to gain sexual favors would become exhausting and annoying. As a man, this is purely speculation, but I would guess that when a women hears, “Hey baby, looking good,” she immediately assumes a lack of sincerity. Yet, if I heard a similar compliment, I would feel valued simply because I have never felt used in quite the same way. This of course doesn’t even acknowledge that women must also deal with a legitimate threat of sexual assault, while the danger to men is less of a concern given the physical disparity between the two groups. Does this justify the outrage from women, arguably rooted not in frustration but motivated by a sense of urgency given that their physical well-being is at stake? While perhaps justified, anger will not lead to better understanding or constructive discourse. A significant group of men who catcall are not sexual predators, and eliminating catcalling will not eliminate sexual assault. This is a more serious and separate issue that is not a direct result of catcalling, though they are rooted in a similar problem. There is a fundamental divide in the experiences of men and women. Men might not recognize the potential harm in such practices simply because they haven’t had to deal with them in the same way. Thus, criticisms that target male entitlement or appeal to an institutionalized disrespect of women are misguided. A man wouldn’t mind being publicly called out for superficial characteristics in the same way as a woman, because men don’t experience this in the same way. At the root of this passionate divide there is misunderstanding, and the key to resolving this divide is compassion and consideration. While it is easy to dismiss people’s criticisms simply because you can’t see a justification for them from your perspective, understand that their criticisms are rooted in legitimate pain or discomfort that you may not fully appreciate. Becoming irritated by another person’s lack of understanding and responding with anger and criticism will solve nothing. If something does not make sense to people and the primary argument they hear is criticism of their lack of understanding, the response naturally will be more anger and frustration. We need to bridge the gap between our own experiences and the experiences of others. Before we shout down feminists, we should really try to listen to why they are upset. Before you become upset with men for being so rude and disrespectful, understand their experiences are different from your own. Some people argue that the burden of understanding inherently falls on men because they are the beneficiaries of this disparity. Sure, but you can’t expect men to understand this disparity if many don’t even realize it exists.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a computer science major from Pittsburgh, Pa.

74810|~|Tough conversations after Ferguson|~|   December 3 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|For many students, going home or visiting relatives for Thanksgiving  meant avoiding controversial topics like the events in Ferguson, Mo., only a few days before. This tact may be necessary on one special day of the year, but as harmful racial attitudes continue to persist in all circles of society, those of us who are not black must break the silence and challenge these attitudes in our hometowns, as well as at the University. I believe that the biggest factor preventing more people who are not black, Princeton students included, from becoming active allies is the cognitive dissonance of recognizing the attitudes and comments of friends, family and oneself that reflect or perpetuate racism. We feel that those whom we love and respect cannot be guilty of racism. Ultimately, we may all give in to and perpetuate the racism that is woven into the very fabric of society — but these mistakes, both macro- and micro-aggressions, are harmful and destructive, and must be responded to as such. We need to challenge the racist assumptions not only of strangers or acquaintances, but also of those close to us as well. We should respond to racist attitudes with sensitivity, even though I have recently come to believe that while the sensitive, civil approach is important, it is secondary to the urgency of the anti-racist message. In response to the horrific injustice faced by African-Americans, we cannot be overly concerned about appearing self-righteous or argumentative. In order to have these conversations, we must identify those ideas that are legitimate, if different from what might typically be considered progressive, and those ideas that are not legitimate, but reflections of deeply ingrained societal racism. It is useful to take a closer look at some of the talking points that have been used extensively in the wake of the grand jury’s decision last Monday. One such talking point is the idea of “personal responsibility,” which the Brookings Institute defines as “the willingness to both accept the importance of standards that society establishes for individual behavior and to make strenuous personal efforts to live by those standards.” This idea, which often comes from a more conservative perspective, is valuable in discussions about education, employment, etc. However, the belief among many that a lack of personal responsibility is to blame for issues like urban poverty and police brutality is highly problematic and only perpetuates racism. To begin with, it is one thing for blacks to advocate self-empowerment through personal responsibility and another for whites to preach responsibility as if completely unaware of their own white privilege. Furthermore, the implication that a black teenager is personally responsible for profiling, targeting and brutality by police, in a country where in recent years young African American males were at a 21 times greater risk of being shot dead by police than their white counterparts, simply because he dresses a certain way or acts “threateningly” is as absurd and incredibly harmful as blaming a victim of sexual assault for dressing “provocatively.” And in a nation where African Americans make up 13% of the population and 14% of drug users but 37% of the people arrested for drugs and 56% of the people in state prisons for drug offenses, the idea that personal irresponsibility among blacks is to blame for the high rates of incarceration is simply bald-faced racism. One cannot speak of law and order without first recognizing the countless daily failures of a justice system that has been failing for centuries. An even more insidious and offensive talking point that I have seen is the concept of the “Real Black American.” Those who use this phrase act as though they are simply acknowledging the already quite obvious fact that the vast majority of blacks are peaceful, law-abiding citizens. Instead, this phrase is a way of justifying the exclusion of African-Americans, often the urban poor, from mainstream society, implying that victims of police brutality are not “Real Black Americans.” It is an extension of the arguments made for disenfranchising blacks. In a country where, in 2011-12, black students were suspended or expelled at triple the rate of their white peers, this widespread, systemic marginalization and exclusion cannot be allowed to continue. As allies, we must assume the role not of leaders, but of vocal, active supporters in the movement against societal and individual racism. This means that we must challenge racist attitudes expressed not only by strangers and acquaintances but by those close to us as well. Until seeing the reactions to Ferguson and reading the excellent op-ed written by Destiny Crockett ’17, Khallid Love ’15, Briana Payton ’17 and Sol Taubin ’16, I was too reluctant to engage in conversation on race, unsure of what role I should take as a white student and how to contribute sensitively to the conversation. I recognize that this column is only echoing what wiser, more eloquent people have said already, black and white. But sometimes urgency trumps originality, because certain things need to be repeated. We must all recognize that, although we may make mistakes in our efforts, we must engage as self-aware, self-reflecting individuals in the complex process of understanding and combating the shameful presence of racism.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I.

74640|~|Successful dreams and failing realities|~|   December 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Logan Sander|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Often, reality doesn’t match our expectations. And, usually, that’s okay — it’s something we either learn to live with or work with. One such disparity, as brought to light by a new Harvard Business Review study, however, shows us that sometimes it’s not okay. In short, the study examined a total of 7,000 Harvard Business School graduates and analyzed their expectations for careers, child care and the balance of the two between spouses. Then, the study compared those expectations with how things actually panned out — with reality. The results clearly show that men’s and women’s expectations are both different from one another and different in how they size up against reality. Not so surprisingly, women seem to get the shorter end of the stick. According to the study of 32- to 67-year-olds as well as a New York Times article analyzing the data, roughly 60 percent of male graduates expected that their jobs would be of more importance than their wives’ jobs while only 17 to 25 percent of women thought that their husbands’ jobs would. In reality, almost 75 percent of the males found that their expectations met reality — that is, that their jobs took precedence — while the women found that their husbands’ careers took precedence 40 percent of the time, a much higher percentage compared to what they expected. Similar discrepancies showed up in child care — more men expected women to do most of the child care (which turned out to be true for most) while only half the women surveyed expected the same (but almost two-thirds of the women found that they were doing more than an equal share). Graduates aged 26 to 31 are showing similar discrepancies in expectations. The shocking part about this study is that most of the 11 percent of women who ended up leaving their jobs full-time did not do so because they prefer to care for children but because they “find themselves in unfulfilling roles with dim prospects for advancement.” And let’s remember that this study is of Harvard graduates, who should have pretty good prospects of advancing in their careers and are probably pretty ambitious. There’s one thing we’re doing right: facilitating growth in the idea of equality and encouraging women to aspire to whatever career goals they set their eyes on (and the study found career expectations between men and women after graduation were similar). Ideologically, we’re fine. What we’re doing wrong is stopping at expectations. Women can have all the expectations they want, but if the reality of social stigmas and constraints doesn’t match, then what good are expectations? The fact is that women are expecting equality in the workplace and at home, but reality just doesn’t match up.I’m tired of hearing the argument that more women stay home just because they want to or end up with “lesser” careers or more responsibility in child care just because they want to. Of course, that’s not to say some women don’t stay home by choice; there is nothing wrong with opting out of a career in order to raise children. The problem arises when mothers feel forced to do so or feel that their career is less important than their husbands’, especially when this doesn’t align with their original intent. Society is still pressuring mothers to stay home; if there is a need for a parent to sacrifice a career for child care, pressure from society dictates that it should be the mother. A 2007 study from Cornell found that employers see mothers as the least desirable employees — after fathers, childless women and childless men. There is an unfair cultural stigma against mothers in the workplace, and that needs to change. I can’t offer a perfect solution, but I can argue that we work to find one. At least, we need to change our mindset about how we view women in the workplace and at home. Women don’t belong at home and they don’t belong in the workplace — they belong wherever they want to be. Yes, expectations change, but they should be changing based on what is best for your goals, your life and your family. They should not be changing based on social “norms” or what society says most women want. They should not be changing based on men’s expectations of a woman’s role in a marriage or “dim prospects” offered in the workplace. Sometimes it’s OK to change your expectations to meet reality; we do it all the time. What matters is why you change them. Women now have the opportunity to expect whatever they want for their lives, but what they don’t have is the same chance to realize those expectations as men — that is one of those disparities that isn’t solved by learning to live with it or work with it. In this case, reality needs to meet our expectations.|~|Logan Sander is a freshman from Sylvania, Ohio. She can be reached at lmsander@princeton.edu.

74647|~|On Ferguson |~|   December 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|I do not have to worry about being too suspicious. I do not have to worry about the clothes I wear. I do not have to worry about people crossing the street to avoid me. I do not have to worry about storeowners carefully watching my every move. In fact, I have experienced the opposite. Whether it is true or not, as an Asian-American, people are disposed to think of me as more reliable, smart and hard-working. While I am subject to the occasional Mr. Miyagi joke, I live a “normal” life. As author Liz Lin beautifully puts it, as an Asian-American, I “do have some privileges.” And it is because of this, in light of the recent events in Ferguson, that I have been extremely hesitant to speak. After all, who cares what I have to say? I have my thoughts, but my experiences don’t even remotely compare to those of either black or white Americans. My family does not have deep, historical roots that have interacted with either side of the debate. As an adopted Asian-American male, I told myself I had no place, no authority to speak on such a pressing issue. But that’s where I was dead wrong. We need to care. Regardless of what one thinks of the trial itself, it is clear that we live in polarizing times. We live in a world where a segment of our society no longer has faith in the judicial system built to protect it. And it does not matter what side of the political, racial or societal aisle you’re on to realize that it’s clearly a problem. However, we often fall into the trap of dichotomies. You are either on one side or the other. Black or white. Rich or poor. Democrat or Republican. But most of us are not reducible to these simple identifiers. We are so much more. And many of us find ourselves not fitting neatly into one of the categories, simply falling through the cracks and ignoring the debate entirely. It’s happened to me, and I’m not the only one. But it’s not an excuse. Last year, I wrote an article titled “Forgetting I’m Asian” where I battled over my own issues of figuring out whether I fit in better with my adopted white upbringing or my Asian origins. On the basis of my skin, I felt that I had to self-identify as one or the other. To me, the choice was mutually exclusive; how could you be one without not being the other? But, in the last year, I’ve realized that life is not so binary. Yes, the world is full of zeros and ones, but it’s full of an infinite set of numbers in between, too. Granted, that’s not to dismiss the role of unity under a common goal or experience. It was only through the work of African-Americans that political and economic equality became less of an ideal and more of a reality. Today, black activists are rallying around Ferguson and fighting for significant and meaningful change, helping us realize that our world is far from a “post-racial” society. The views of those directly affected are undeniably essential to any discussion. But that does not mean that others should be ignored. Among those marching from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965 were not only Martin Luther King, Jr. and other black leaders but also Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and other members of the Jewish community. Additionally, Bayard Rustin, one of the founders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Dr. King, became a powerful advocate for LGBT rights in a time when same-sex couples were still heavily disparaged by society. History is — and has always been — more than just a two-sided conflict. It includes a plethora of actors from a multitude of backgrounds. At the end of the day, we do not live in a black or white America but a united one. It’s one of Anglo-, African-, Mexican-, Asian-, Indian-Americans and so much more. And, while the country is still divided and there is much left to do, we do not have a pass to sit things out just because we do not fall perfectly into one category or the other. Whether it be discussing the topic and spreading awareness among friends, donating to a cause or physically participating in a public rally as hundreds of Princeton students did last week, we are capable of meaningful actions that will collectively push us forward in the right direction. But it can only be done if each of us does his or her part. It is up to us to care.|~|Ben Dinovelli is a Wilson School major from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu. 
74631|~|Thoughts on freshman columnists|~|   December 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|The belief that freshmen should not write opinion columns is apparently widespread. It lurks in the comments section of The Daily Princetonian’s website, as Sarah Sakha noted in her column “Just keep scrolling.” On Yik Yak, I have seen the same post soar past 100 up-votes, so it cannot be written off as a fringe belief of angry Internet denizens. Reading the paper, I have even found myself agreeing: We freshmen suck at this. Sakha dedicated a brief paragraph to defending the freshman voice, but I want to justify it thoroughly. First, writing is the cure to our inexperience. My own first column demanded extensive revisions from an associate editor, and after that revision process, my writing was a little stronger. Hopefully, I have continued to improve with every article. Yet growth is slow. Newcomers to any field — be it singing, dancing, juggling or opining — start without really knowing what to do. If you judge them by their first few attempts, they’ll seem terrible. Their first few failures are necessary, however, for them to learn and improve. I suspect that my writing quality would have been no better if I had joined the ‘Prince’ as a sophomore, so writing as a freshman will allow me to produce better quality work for the next three years. In fact, I wager that if everyone joined as a sophomore, our website would be home to comments that claim, “Sophomores shouldn’t write opinion pieces.” Whatever our age, our writing will be a little below par when we’re newbies. Another argument that purports to justify anti-freshman sentiment goes like this: Freshmen just got here, so they don’t know what they’re talking about. For a lot of subjects, this holds true. Last month, in a comment to Logan Sander’s article “Privacy should be a right,” I wrote that men’s bathrooms should not have locks because men do not want them. Although this seems to be the overwhelming consensus among male freshmen and sophomores, another student informed me that men in upperclass dorms are frustrated with women frequenting their bathrooms. I had not known this. My freshman experience had precluded a viewpoint as nuanced as his. In spite of this, the perspectives that freshmen offer are worth hearing. By the same token that my voice should not matter with respect to locks in upperclass dorms, a junior’s frustration should not influence what happens to bathroom locks in residential colleges. The experiences of freshmen and sophomores aren’t less valuable; they’re just different. It is crucial that first-year students have a voice, too, so that fresh minds can puzzle through issues that our older brothers and sisters have accepted as inevitable inconveniences of life in the Orange Bubble. A 1967 study on the behavior of rhesus monkeys illustrates the pitfalls of ignoring the youngest group members. Five monkeys were put into a room where bananas rested atop a ladder. When a monkey tried to climb the ladder, they were all sprayed with a cold shower. Before long, they learned to avoid the ladder altogether. Then, one member of the group was replaced. The naïve monkey tried to climb the ladder, but the other four pulled him off and beat him in order to avoid the rainy punishment. Experimenters continued to replace the monkeys one-by-one, all of them beaten by their group when they reached for the bananas. Eventually, none of the four senior monkeys had been there to suffer the showers, but they still beat the new arrival who moved to climb the ladder. They couldn’t have known why they did it — they only knew that this was the way things were done. Silencing those with the least experience had created a culture where everyone accepted and perpetuated torment without knowing why, and this same phenomenon would cause progress to stagnate for student life if freshmen did not have a voice. I am not defending the quality of any particular piece nor do I believe that freshman writers should be shielded from criticism. Sometimes in our haste to meet the obligations of the article cycle, we settle upon a bad idea. Other times we execute good ideas poorly. Sometimes we’re just wrong. Whatever the reason for a bad column, our failures are part of a learning process that will see us become better writers for the next three years. We’ll get better, and in the meantime, some of us will think of incisive ideas that only freshmen could have. Prepare for us to make a few more mistakes, but know that our voice is valuable.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn. He can be reached at newby@princeton.edu.

She grabbed my hands in hers and held them tightly. She told me to be strong, not to lose hope and confidence and not to let anyone question my capabilities and intellectual capacity. She put down her head and began to pray and cry. My mother is a strong woman, and the only time that I’ve seen her cry is when she prayed. But this time, the words she was praying sounded different —heavier, more painful, more desperate. After she was done, she gave me a firm, long hug and whispered, “Don’t let them get you down, my son.” This memory came up in my mind when I stood with hundreds of other Princeton students in front of Robertson Hall to give four and a half minutes of silence for Michael Brown following the march down Prospect Avenue and the announcement of the Ferguson grand jury’s decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson. When the four and a half minutes were up, I looked up and saw some people around me crying. One person in particular — a black male student — was crying with exceptional passion. When I saw this, I began to understand the pain and desperation behind my mother’s words as she prayed for my safety in college. My mother knew that I, as a person of color entering a prestigious and predominantly white institution, would be judged based on the color of my skin. As a person of color, I’ve faced microaggressions since coming to the University. However, when I saw that student crying in front of Robertson Hall, I knew that there were bigger problems here in the United States. When I go walk around in public spaces, I might get a few peculiar stares here and there for whatever reason. But, unlike him and other black men, I won’t be outwardly avoided by people, followed around by policemen or have to worry about being shot because of the way society perceives me. After the four and a half minutes, a junior who helped lead the protest talked about how we, as Princeton students, must use the privileges that we have to help create change. At an institution with as many resources and opportunities like ours, it is easy to become complacent and to forget about the problems plaguing the world outside the Orange Bubble. At the protest, I noticed that there were collections of people from all ethnic groups. To me, this was significant because I’ve noticed that programs and campaigns run by the University or students, like “I, Too, Am Princeton,” which aim to combat minority issues, are almost completely composed of the groups at which they are targeted. However, we must take a more holistic approach by getting those students outside of these groups involved in order to efficiently combat these issues. Seeing people of all races at the Michael Brown protest shines a light on the fact that everyone, whether directly or indirectly, is affected by these things. As Princeton students, we should use our intellectual vitality to create a dialogue in which people from all ethnic backgrounds are heard. No longer can we ignore the police brutality against young black men in America and label it as a solely “black issue.” At the end of the day, it is as much of a white person’s problem as it is a black person’s problem. To further combat these issues, we must continue to keep the dialogue going and not let it fade into oblivion. Whether through more photo campaigns, events or discussions at home, it is important to let ourselves and the people around us be cognizant of these issues and to think about them critically.|~|
74494|~|The role of a university in handling rape cases|~|   December 1 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|If I had been deeply disturbed after reading the Rolling Stone’s article on the rape culture at the University of Virginia, I was even more so after watching the uncut interview video of Nicole Eramo, associate dean of students and head of the Sexual Misconduct Board at UVA. The article discusses the rape culture at this southern campus, where Greek life dominates the social life and where a girl, who goes by the pseudonym Jackie, was gang-raped by seven Phi Kappa Psi brothers as a freshman. This interview was conducted by a student media organization, WUVA, weeks prior to the publication of the article. The interviewee — Eramo — is who Jackie went to for support at the end of her freshman year. Jackie is currently defending Eramo from the attacks that the Rolling Stone article generated; she is one of the many signatories to an open letter to UVA’s President Teresa Sullivan, which aims to “advocat[e] for our advocate.” She believes that Eramo’s emotional support was crucial to her. She writes, “Dean Eramo has truly saved my life. If it were not for her, I do not know if I could be alive today.” And, of course, Jackie is entitled to this view. But to me, there is a difference between conceding that Eramo is an asset to UVA and arguing that the views she holds are beneficial to UVA. Eramo as a person may have been helpful, but as an administrator, she has failed the survivors. In the interview, the student interviewer asks in frustration why those who have admitted to being rapists are not expelled while those who are found guilty of academic cheating are. Eramo’s response: “I feel like if a person is willing to come forward in that setting and admit that they violated the policy when there’s absolutely no advantage to do so, that that does deserve some consideration. That they’re willing to say, ‘I’ve done something wrong, and I recognize that, and I’m willing to take my licks and deal with it,’ that’s very important to me. I think that shows a level of understanding of what they did that I don’t see in a hearing necessarily.” This is an outrageous statement. To begin with, I actually don’t know how they are taking their “licks” when they will only be suspended for one to two years maximum. While Eramo seems to believe that this is “stiff punishment,” a two-year suspension to punish a horrendous violation of someone else’s privacy is not sufficient. Her statement reveals a troubling thought process that universities maintain when handling rape cases. Academic institutions are not equipped to handle criminal cases. Failures by even top-tier institutions such as Harvard University, Columbia University and even our own Princeton University attest to this. Ideally, such cases should go to a court of law. However, given that this is a long, frustrating and costly process, this is often an unrealistic option. But with respect to cases of sexual assault, universities should have one and one role only: to ensure the permanent removal of danger from campus. Eramo doesn’t have the expertise to differentiate between a genuinely sorry person and a scheming criminal who has read records of how previous rape cases were handled. No university does. The university’s job is not to rehabilitate known dangers, but rather to create a campus that is as removed from danger as possible. Therefore, a suspension simply does not make the cut. The university can require completion of community service and sex education, but it will never be sure if it has successfully rehabilitated the rapists. And it will never know until that person graduates or commits another crime. This is a large risk to take when studies show that rapists tend to be repeat offenders. Expulsion is simply the most effective risk management. Eramo will say that such a measure will decrease the number of victims coming forward because survivors often do not want to punish their rapists. In her words, they only want to be able to look them in the eyes and say, “You have wronged me.” But Eramo needs to realize that her job expands beyond that. Her job is to ensure both that the victim has their say and that the campus is a safe place. And this is where her most egregious failure comes into play: As an adviser, she should encourage survivors to file complaints, both informal and formal. It is a university’s responsibility to make survivors aware of the consequences, both to victims and to the student body more generally, of allowing the perpetrator of a rape to remain on campus. Universities should make sure, even before rape cases occur, that students are informed that it is natural and right to seek retribution toward someone who has wronged them. And then the university should expel the rapists.|~|Erica Choi is a freshman from Bronxville, NY. She can be reached at gc6@princeton.edu. 
74385|~|Finding true love on the Princeton campus|~|   December 1 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By W. Barksdale Maynard ’88 May I offer you some advice? I think every undergraduate should make it a point to fall in love while they are here. That is, to fall in love with Princeton’s architecture. Hey, you might find yourself after graduation at Caltech or NYU, and then what kind of building are you likely to meet? It’s going to be some angular agglomeration of aluminum and exposed ductwork, sadly unworthy of your aesthetic sensitivities, and you will cry yourself to sleep every night remembering Holder and Witherspoon Halls. Don’t say I didn’t warn you! My spring course is ART251/ARC251: Architecture of Princeton University, where we will explore every corner of the campus and then debate the question of why, exactly, Princeton is so outstanding. “America’s Campus,” I call it in my book, because the word “campus” was first used here in 1774 and later spread everywhere. Never forget it: We are nothing less than the great campus prototype, a gloriously designed landscape older than the United States itself. What accounts for our seductive appeal, now that Forbes magazine has named us one of the most beautiful campuses in the world and tourists from Guangdong seemingly spend all day taking photographs of Cannon Green and the University Chapel? In part, Princeton’s charm lies in its sheer architectural variety, which borders on the bewildering. The same school that recreated Hogwarts at Whitman College using 6,000 tons of stone was simultaneously paying Frank Gehry to build Lewis Library out of stainless steel. I thought that was the most thrilling architectural duel in the country around 2006, especially when Gehry badmouthed the other architect for “mucking around in the past.” Fighting about Princeton’s architecture is nothing new: The gentlemen in powdered wigs who funded Nassau Hall probably threw snuffboxes when they debated using brick versus stone. Kudos, by the way, to the stonemason they finally chose, William Worth. His fieldstone walls are still worthy after 260 years, if reduced to a piebald stamp album by too many recent Class Stones. Surely Nassau Hall and Front Campus should be sacred. Class of 2015, can you show bold leadership and put to rest this clunky and cluttering Class Stone tradition — spending the money instead on some more pleasing embellishment of America’s Campus? After the Civil War, the fighting on campus was about Gothic Revival architecture, which some considered too British for Revolutionary Princeton. When sober old East College was knocked down to build Collegiate Gothic East Pyne Hall, alumni went berserk about the “Crime of ’96.” “Such a break with the past — with all the old college life and traditions — it seems to me would strike anyone as shocking,” Ellen Wilson told her professor-husband, Woodrow, who heartily agreed. How about you — would you be shocked if your favorite Princeton building were demolished tomorrow? Would you protest? Hardly any alumni complained when the University recently tore down the oldest building on Prospect Avenue, dainty little Osborn Clubhouse of 1892, to build the science center now under construction. Not one student chanted “Save the Victorian Streetscape!” through a bullhorn or valiantly chained herself to a backhoe. I have often wondered why not. Has today’s screen-riveted generation failed to fall in love with Princeton the way Ellen Wilson once did? Brimming with love of beauty, Ellen Wilson planted a rose garden at Prospect House when she lived there. Later, she created the Rose Garden at the White House, directing the gardeners from her wheelchair — afflicted with an incurable disease, she had only weeks to live. She told them, make it as beautiful as Princeton. An earlier resident of the White House, the amateur architect Thomas Jefferson, once stared at a stylish building in Paris “like a lover at his mistress.” I hope you will similarly gaze like a lover at Blair Tower or Foulke and Henry Halls some balmy spring weekend, trying to memorize every detail — not of eyebrows and lips but of mullions and niches, so full of swelling curves and voluptuous moldings. And then, in the last days in May before you finally graduate, run your fingers across the sumptuous granite and brownstone of Alexander Hall — so old, so beautiful and mellowing in the wind and rain of more than a century — and swear that you will remember it forever. Yes, that’s my advice: Let yourself fall in love with the Princeton campus, utterly and passionately. Give in completely. And do it now — before graduation brings sweet sorrow. W. Barksdale Maynard ’88 is a lecturer in the Department of Art and Archaeology. He wrote the book “Princeton: America’s Campus” and will teach the spring course, ART251/ARC251: Architecture of Princeton University.|~|

74387|~|Editorial: Implement beginner-level precepts |~|   November 30 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The computer science department recently announced that this spring’s introductory computer science course, COS 126, will offer two precepts for novice students with little or no computer science background. Instead of the usual 50-minute precept length, these beginner precepts will be 80 minutes long, “giving time to complete precept exercises and answer basic questions.” The Editorial Board strongly endorses this innovation and recommends that this precept model be implemented on a broader scale across University departments, specifically in introductory-level courses with non-evaluative precepts. There are good reasons for widely implementing this precept structure. No matter the 100- or 200-level course, there will always be students in a class with varying levels of exposure to the material presented. It is far easier for students with little to no exposure to fall behind (due to the rapid nature, short lecture lengths and infrequent exams of University classes), and these students should not be penalized for a lack of background knowledge. With longer precepts, brevity and speed will no longer be additional obstacles. Creating precepts of longer length would allow students with little or no background in a class’s material to ask more questions to gain additional reinforcement of class concepts. Given that most students in these precepts would be at the same beginning level, students would need not fear slowing the precept down or asking “stupid questions,” allowing for more thorough and gradual understanding across the precept. The implementation of these precepts will also promote intellectual curiosity as a whole; students will be reassured of additional academic support should they choose to venture outside their academic comfort zones and try something completely new. However, the Board realizes that the additional precepts are not practical nor necessary for every course on campus, so we offer some criteria. First, these precepts should only be implemented in introductory-level classes. If a course has prerequisites, students in the course all must have at least that background exposure, rendering beginner precepts unnecessary. Moreover, these precepts only work in classes with non-evaluative precepts; the structure works best in class-based sections where discussion and participation are not graded, preventing more advanced students from joining a beginner precept and monopolizing discussion in order to achieve a higher grade. Based on these criteria, courses like ECO 100: Introduction to Microeconomics and ECO 101: Introduction to Macroeconomics would be well-suited for adding these longer precepts, while ECO 310: Microeconomic Theory (with ECO 100 as a prerequisite) and HIS 383: The United States, 1920-1974 (with graded precept participation) would not. As for the precepts themselves, the material covered should be the same as in the shorter, standard precepts. This works both ways: First, students in the precept can guarantee that they will not be receiving a more basic version of the material; the entire purpose of longer precepts is so that students can learn the same knowledge, just at a slower pace. Furthermore, these precepts should not cover additional problems or material over that of all other precepts. There should be no advantage provided to students in a longer precept other than from the additional 30 minutes of asking questions and working through standard precept problems at a more gradual pace. Providing extra practice problems or previewing new material would be unfair. Again, the Board lauds the computer science department for recognizing the diversity of students in COS 126 and catering to their various needs by introducing longer, novice-oriented precepts. Consequently, we suggest a wider implementation of this precept structure across departments. These precepts would greatly benefit the learning experience at Princeton, especially for students looking to engage in new academic territories.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief. 
74337|~|Ferguson: Princeton's violent inactivity|~|   November 27 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|On August 9, 2014, an unarmed Black teenager named Michael Brown was shot at 12 times by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Six of those shots hit their mark. Brown’s dead body remained on the ground for four and a half hours before it was collected. In the four months since his killing, protesters in the city of Ferguson, Mo., have taken to the streets to demand an indictment. They have been repressed, brutalized and denied their basic human rights. Their voices have been censored; their bodies attacked with excessive violence and chemicals unsanctioned in acts of warfare. Protesters suffered the same violence after Ferguson’s grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson at 9 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 24, 2014. As Princeton students, we had the privilege to suffer no such violence. On the night of the “no indictment” verdict, we were able to protest on a campus where the local police force did not teargas us. Instead, they protected our rights to assemble as we marched in front of peers who chose to proceed with “Dranksgiving” celebrations on Prospect Avenue. Princeton has become a site for violence by inactivity. We have allowed it to serve as a safe haven for ignoring systemic injustices. This is no longer excusable. Yet, we do not protest now because we have suddenly realized that Princeton degrees do not make the Black students at our University any more bulletproof than Tamir Rice or Trayvon Martin were, their necks any less hangable than Lennon Lacy’s, or their skulls any less breakable than Tanisha Anderson’s. We protest now because Black bodies are still being perforated, lynched and broken because of their blackness. We protest now because we are sick and tired of the ongoing dehumanization of blackness; it is systemic, intentional and it demands our response. We are declaring war on these bigoted structures and ideologies that terrorize the human race. In 2013, 86 percent of people stopped by Ferguson police were Black. Once stopped, Black people’s vehicles were searched 1.77 times as often as White people’s. Their contraband hit-rate was less than two-thirds of White people’s, but they were arrested twice as often. Of the 12 individuals on Michael Brown’s grand jury, nine (coincidentally, the number necessary to form a verdict regarding his killer’s indictment) were White. This does not stop at St. Louis city limits. The U.S. criminal justice system is a race-based institution that directly devalued Michael Brown’s life, devalues the lives of protesters in Ferguson, and devalues all Black life. It not only fails Black people but works vigorously to target and punish Black lives more aggressively than white lives. Institutionalized racial inequality is housed in America’s local, state and federal courts, a phenomenon dating back to the Dred Scott case of 1857. Historically, protection of Black bodies has not been a primary concern for the juridical system. Racial bias is evident in virtually every aspect of the criminal justice system — from drug policies and legal representation to term lengths and parole. Yet it does not stop at our justice system. The notion that Black lives are worthless is entrenched in the psyche of America. Systemic racism continually damages our subconscious. A Black child — however innocent — will often be deemed guilty until proven valuable. Black boys, starting from around age 10, are judged by law enforcement as older than they really are. When a child is perceived as a man, that child is viewed as more capable of criminal activity. When a child is understood to be a Blackman, that child is assumed to be already involved in criminal activity, and perceived as violent. This only further embeds the implicit biases in law enforcement and the criminal justice system. We protest because we have to. We shout “Black Lives Matter” because the trope of the ever-dangerous Black child must disappear. We discuss, demand and criticize because the only way to break down systems and dismantle subconscious racism is to be fervently anti-racist.  Call to Anti-racist and Anti-oppressive Action Step 1: Get educated. Learn about people’s lived experiences by listening actively and openly. There is a time and place to play devil’s advocate — it is not when marginalized people are sharing their stories. Participate in dialogues and attend lectures hosted through CAF or by one of Princeton’s many cultural groups. Read the essentials, including Beverly Tatum’s “Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?: And Other Conversations about Race”, Michelle Alexander’s “The New Jim Crow” and James Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time.” Consider taking one of the following courses next semester: AAS247/POL382: The New Jim Crow: US Crime Policy from Constitutional Formation to Ferguson, WWS331/SOC312/AAS317: Race and Public Policy or SOC236: Race Is Socially Constructed: Now What? Step 2: Be an ally. Stand up for issues that do not directly impact you. Challenge the caricaturization of blackness, even if it makes you and other people uncomfortable. Remember that being an ally means amplifying the voices of the oppressed — not being at the forefront. Step 3: Fight in the trenches. Stop being risk-averse — continue past “dialogue.” Make fighting racism and oppression a priority — not having the time because of Princeton’s workload is not excusable. Participate in protests, rallies, boycotts and campus or organization-wide events. Step 4: Use your Princeton privilege. We as students, faculty and administrators have a responsibility to challenge inequitable ideologies, practices and policies … “in the nation’s service, and the service of all nations.” Authors Destiny Crockett Khallid Love Briana Payton Sol Taubin Editors Kovey Coles Yoselin Gramajo Terrence Fraser Asanni York Proofreaders Aisha Oxley Teri Tilman|~|Editor’s note: This article has been updated to capitalize the words ‘Black’ and ‘White’ at the request of the authors.

74273|~|Some thoughts on waffle fries |~|   November 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Schwartz|~|   Opinion Editor     |~|Tonight, I had a conversation with a stranger in a dining hall. About USG elections. I have never done this before. Not once, in my now almost four years here, have I given enough thought to the USG presidential candidates to engage in a heated debate over their respective merits — let alone a debate with a student I’ve never talked to before. I couldn’t tell you who I voted for in the past couple of USG elections. Truthfully, I’m not sure I could remember if I even did vote at all. This year, though, is different. This year, there is Will Gansa. If you have somehow missed the brouhaha surrounding this year’s elections, here’s the deal: there are three candidates for USG president — Molly Stoneman ’16, Ella Cheng ’16 and Will Gansa ’17. Stoneman is the current USG vice president, and she is running to, among other things, promote women’s leadership and improve events programming. Cheng, current University Student Life Committee chair, wants to emphasize policymaking over programming, and devote increased focus to projects’ execution. And then there’s Gansa. He’s unaffiliated with USG, and is running on a platform of waffle fries, hand-ripened fruit, bringing back ICE and “bike reform.” His campaign website features spoof endorsements and a video of him eating waffle fries. His candidacy shares a lot in common with that of Samuel Clark and Gus Mayopoulos, joke candidates who ran (and won) in last year’s Harvard Undergraduate Council election. There are many circulating theories as to Gansa’s motives. First, there’s his own rationale — that he’s combatting the USG’s “tyranny of incumbency.” Then, there’s the idea that his whole campaign is satire. In his overblown self-presentation, he’s mocking the pageantry and politics inherent in USG elections. In his seemingly inconsequential platform issues, he’s parodying the ineffectual changes that USG is able to, or decides to, effect. He may even be calling out Princeton’s collective hesitation to confront serious University policy issues, like sexual assault and transparency in mental health-related forced withdrawals. If satire is Gansa’s goal (and I’m inclined to think it is) then that’s good. Both Stoneman and Cheng have also acknowledged that USG is out of touch with students, and I know that many of my friends share that sentiment. Critique deserves to be taken seriously. And yet. I did not vote for Will Gansa. Whatever his reasons are for launching this campaign, however noble they may be, if he were to be elected there would only be two options for his presidency. He could follow the platform he set out and accomplish next to nothing of significance. Alternatively, as friends have suggested to me, Gansa would have an opportunity to address and remedy his more substantial critiques of USG and Princeton as a whole. He could begin implementing substantive changes to policy and student life. The problem is, we have no way of knowing what those changes would entail. We would not have voted for them on any platform. There would be no way to know whether these would be changes the student body would want to see. But, even considering all of this, I keep coming back to the dinner conversation I had tonight. I think it’s important. I have heard more conversation about elections — in dining halls, on Facebook, on YikYak, even — than I have ever heard on this campus before. And because of that, Gansa’s candidacy has tremendous power and relevance. Gansa is in no way a viable candidate. But he has us talking about USG. In observing the obvious inadequacies of a joke platform, we’re forced to critique the status quo. Gansa’s four platform issues don’t matter. But then, the obvious question is, what issues do matter?  In urging the Harvard student body not to vote for Clark and Mayopoulos in 2013, one of the other candidates wrote, “Satire can point out problems, but we’ll provide solutions.” Let’s use Gansa’s satire to rally around the problems other candidates have solutions for. Let’s keep the discussion going, and hold these other candidates accountable to their promises. Waffle fries, bike reform — none of it is important. So — what is?|~|Sarah Schwartz is a history major from Silver Spring, Md. She can be reached at seschwar@princeton.edu. 
74177|~|Accepting political differences|~|   November 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|As a Jewish student interested in politics, I’ve followed the divestment debate closely, and I’ve been extremely disappointed by what I’ve encountered. Don’t get me wrong: I love the fact that students are so actively engaged with the issue on both sides. Every time I walk by the tables in Frist Campus Center with the two competing sides, pro-divestment and anti-divestment, I can’t help but smile. I love reading the various columns about the topic in The Daily Princetonian. The fact that people are seizing the opportunity to raise awareness on causes they believe passionately in is an attribute I admire and respect. However, when I’ve participated in discussions on divestment, I’ve been both shocked and disappointed by the lack of tolerance and respect people grant to those who have different opinions than their own. I’ve yet to personally develop an opinion on divestment at Princeton, so I have not signed either student petition that has been circulating. As someone interested in international human rights, I have been following the Israeli-Palestinian conflict fairly closely and have come to the conclusion that I cannot for certain determine the “right” position, and have therefore not signed a petition. I think there are legitimate points on both sides, and even if one can reach a conclusion on where one stands on the issue, it’s hard to suggest the opposing view is completely invalid. Nevertheless, people are offhandedly dismissing those who disagree with their opinion without listening carefully — or even at all — to what they are saying, sometimes even judging their morality. This is disheartening because it halts the legitimate discussion to be had. Even if this discussion is not going to persuade one to change one’s mind, it is important for people to listen to opposing points of view. People should not be judged on a moral level simply because of their political stance. While I recognize that often the personal and political are tied, it is a shame that relationships are being threatened because of political differences. Regarding the divestment discussion, I’ve seen numerous examples of this. I’ve seen people make assumptions about my stance on the issue, based on other outspoken political beliefs of mine, and then refuse to talk to me about divestment. I’ve heard others explicitly say they are judging others personally simply because of the fact that they signed a petition with which they disagree. And then there was the letter to the editor published in the ‘Prince’ on Nov. 11 where the author described the writers of a piece on divestment as self-hating Jews — as if he knew their thoughts better than they did themselves. This kind of attitude toward controversial issues does not foster productive debate. I recognize it can sometimes be difficult to talk to people with different political opinions. This is especially true with issues that people take personally, like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Admittedly, I try to avoid discussing Israel with a friend from home because we have different opinions and she gets angry with me for my view. Often, I feel that it simply is not worth the emotional wear and tear on our friendship. However, that does not mean it isn’t valuable to have these conversations, and it certainly does not mean you shouldn’t continue to respect others simply because they have different political values. I’m not the obvious candidate to be giving this tolerance lecture. I certainly am passionate about certain issues and have a hard time remembering to let others speak. However, I know this is something I have to work on. When I’m not jumping down someone’s throat, I really enjoy hearing what others have to say (and rebutting their arguments). I was extremely fortunate to participate in an organization at my high school whose entire goal is to start casual debate among people with different political beliefs. It’s why I’ve gotten involved with the American Whig-Cliosophic Society at the University; it’s one of the few settings where discussion across the political aisle is encouraged and facilitated. Through these organizations, I’ve made some good friends who have radically different political views — people with whom I otherwise would not have befriended. Having non-political interactions with people has helped me realize how essential it is to have respectful discussions with those with different opinions, and how important it is to separate political beliefs from their personality. You don’t have to agree with everything someone says and does in order to be friends with them, nor do you have to agree with someone to discuss an issue civilly. Keeping this in mind and separating the two to treat everyone’s opinions with respect is imperative to treating others kindly. Maybe you might even learn something from them, whether or not you change your mind. As we break for Thanksgiving and return home to families who we likely differ with on certain political issues, perhaps we can practice tolerance with those we love. Then, when we return to campus, we can employ these values in our conversations with other students to propagate productive and respectful dialogs.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

74195|~|Homoexoticism is not acceptance|~|   November 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|“I swear I’m not homophobic,” a student said defensively at dinner the other day. “I mean, some of my best friends are gay,” he continued. Having just heard the insensitive remark he had made moments before, I didn’t know what to believe. To an extent, the purpose of his assertion made sense. After all, at a university where levels of image and self-identity are prized and therefore vehemently protected and monitored, no student wants to be called a bigot by his peers. However, his statement sounded a lot like the phrase “not to sound offensive or anything,” a common excuse for saying something that is irrefutably offensive. When we’re called out for being prejudiced, statements like these show that we don’t hold ourselves accountable for the things we say and perhaps even the ideas we subscribe to. Even more so, it shows how far we still have to go on the road to acceptance. When I heard the student say this at dinner, I found myself to be the only one taken aback by his statement. Whipping out the fact that his friend group included people from the LGBTQIA community as justification for the fairly offensive comment he made beforehand still seemed like discrimination to me. While this most likely was not his intent, it reflected the culture that still prevails today — an underlying insensitivity covered up by the appearance of acceptance. While his statement may have seemed harmless enough, we have to remember that no person ever signs up to be the token gay friend, or the token black friend, or the token female friend. Pulling out characteristics of people, like playing cards, for one’s own benefit is simply using them to feel at peace with the possibility of one’s own prejudice. It is merely an example of homoexoticism: exoticizing gay people as a platform to make insensitive comments in order to view them in a different light that is nonetheless offensive. In the 1970s, when policies regarding underrepresentation of historically privileged groups and affirmative action were being discussed and implemented, the definition for discrimination was extended to include the concept of reverse discrimination — the act of favoring individuals belonging to historically disadvantaged and discriminated against groups. However, in the simplest sense, discrimination, to me, is the act of putting people “in their place” and deciding exactly what “place” that is. For example, the term, “gay best friend,” coined and popularized by social media, has glamorized and exoticized the value of having homosexual friends compared to heterosexual friends. I find this phenomenon to be incredibly offensive because behind its illusion of acceptance, it forces people into a restricted niche beyond which any real personality or value system they have to contribute is not only unexpected, but to an extent, unwelcome. A friend once stopped me to draw my attention to a gay couple holding hands and said, “Wait, that’s so cute.” At first, I brushed it off as admiration for a public display of affection; however, I wondered if she would make a similar comment about a heterosexual couple holding hands. Would she have stopped me to take notice of an opposite-sex couple’s moment of romance as she had in this instance? In the modern context, words like “cute” and “adorable” often refer to things that entertain us with their vulnerability, and in this way, our comments have begun to have patronizing undertones. Therefore, when we use these to characterize a homosexual individual’s relationship, it is almost as if we are delegitimizing it, since “cute” and “adorable” describe things that we rarely take seriously. In a sense, by saying these words, we show how we have transitioned from a period of homophobia to one of what I call homoexoticism: acknowledging and applauding homosexuality for what we perceive as its unconventionality. However, neither homophobia nor homoexoticism is even close to true acceptance. True acceptance entails approaching people with non-mainstream sexual orientations or gender identities in the same way we would approach someone who is heterosexual. Even though I’ve heard students make homoexoticizing comments on campus, I do believe that the University and its student body have made exceptional strides with regard to the LGBTQIA movement. After all, just this past Sunday, students gathered for the memorial ceremony on the New Jersey Statewide Trans Day of Remembrance to honor those who had been killed due to anti-transgender hatred and violence. A little more than a month ago, the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Center released a video to commemorate National Coming Out Day — a day that marks the anniversary of the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights and continues to celebrate those who have come out as LGBT or to join the community as a straight ally. Despite these services that reflect the potential and solidarity of the student body, and the on-campus presence of institutions such as the LGBT Center, there is still so much personal work that each student must do, beyond the scope of what these events can do for them. Unless this happens, we will continue to find ourselves enabling a form of discrimination that our generation has conveniently fashioned in order to exonerate ourselves from any blame.|~|Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major from Irvine, Calif.

74178|~|A troubling definition of "equality" |~|   November 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|In this November’s issue of The Princeton Tory, Elly Brown ’18 attempts to dismantle the “false dichotomy” of the opposition between feminists and pro-life activists. There are a number of minor issues with the article, as with most pieces that attempt to tackle the sticky issue of abortion. Brown calls into question Emma Watson’s status as feminist. She implies that she will never change her views on abortion. She misrepresents the pro-life tendencies of early feminists, asserting that they were “largely pro-life”, in what Ann D. Gordon, a Rutgers history professor and leading scholar on the life of Susan B. Anthony, would term as “invented memory,” claims about history made without evidence for modern purposes. There are additional problematic elements in the article, of course, but I’d like to focus on the crux of Brown’s argument. Her main point seems to be that the feminist and pro-life movements are compatible because both view all lives as inherently equal. Feminists act to promote equality between men and women — and, in the case of early feminists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, between whites and blacks — and Brown would extend this argument one step further: born and unborn should be equal as well. She equates “allowing women to pursue careers and success” with the possible futures of fetuses, asserting that the concept of equal rights and opportunities is inconsistent with “the denial of countless opportunities for unborn children.” Furthermore, by misinterpreting an Emma Watson quote which utilizes the phrase “because [she] might give birth to a child one day” as a euphemism for “because [she] is a woman,” Brown contends that “having children does not destine a woman to a life of any less success than that of a woman with no children,” presumably to make the point that “abortion [is not] absolutely necessary” for the eventual equality of women and men. I don’t intend to cover the major fallacies inherent in the stereotypical conservative’s pro-life position — for example, being “pro-life” but opposing welfare programs and common-sense gun control laws while supporting the defunding of schools, implying that the potential opportunities and life value of an unborn child should only be fought for until birth. However, I do see a contradiction in Brown’s case. Brown identifies as a supporter of the pro-life movement. She supports equal rights for all, white and black (and, I assume, other people of color), male and female, born and unborn. However, I fear that Brown misinterprets the goals of the pro-choice movement. The pro-choice movement does not preach total equality for all, born and unborn, but rather the necessity for and equality inherent in bodily autonomy. The platform of said movement is not, as Brown implies, that “abortion [is] absolutely necessary for a woman to achieve at the same level as men.” As someone who is pro-choice, I fully support any woman who believes that abortion is not right — she should be free to carry unborn children to term. Rather, the goal of the pro-choice movement is just that — to allow all women to determine the future of a fetus which is not only wholly dependent on the woman’s body to live, but also emotionally taxing, expensive to support both in terms of financial and bodily resources, and physically painful. Obviously, there are plenty of women who have the resources and time to support children born and unborn, but the pro-choice movement points out that not all women can do this. The logical fallacy which arises from this pro-woman/pro-life stance is that by foisting an pro-life reality on all women regardless of each individual’s opinion, one necessarily claims that some lives are more important than others. Pro-coice supporters would support a woman who is pro-life and who refuses to have an abortion, but if that pro-life supporter enacts legal change which prevents woman who is pro-choice from having one, the former’s opinion would be considered more valuable under the law than that of the pro-choice woman. This seems to contradict itself — if one woman’s opinion overrides another’s, then how are the two equal in any way, shape or form? In supporting equality for all, as Brown argues she does, one must acknowledge that her personal belief or moral/ethical code cannot dictate what another can or can’t do. Otherwise, that person implicitly supports inequality of opinion, which seems anti-feminist and anti-equality. The alliance of the feminist and pro-choice movements is not a logical contradiction because both movements believe that the life and future of a woman are more important than the life and future of her unborn child. After all, as Seth Millstein argues for Bustle, “the ‘right to life’ doesn’t imply a right to use somebody else’s body” to survive. Thus, the major difference between the feminist and pro-life platforms, in terms of Brown’s article, is that feminism freely acknowledges that the attempt at total equality for all results in countless contradictions, whereas, as it is represented in Brown’s argument, the pro-life movement blithely contends that by crushing the voices of women who are currently allowed to choose the fate of a fetus which exists at their expense, equality for all follows immediately.|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

74072|~|The curious case of the 'academically able, politically confused'|~|   November 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Martin Cox I am proof of The Daily Princetonian’s global readership. Living in Oxford, I am a curious and sometimes confused onlooker where American politics are concerned, but I feel I can correct four serious and fundamental mistakes in Sarah Sakha’s recent article (“The curious case of socially liberal, fiscally conservative,” Opinion, Nov. 17). First, Ms. Sakha misunderstands the term “socially liberal”; second, she misunderstands what libertarianism is; third, an inevitable consequence of her first two errors, she mistakenly believes that to be liberal on social issues and conservative on economic matters is to be guilty of a grave, irreconcilable contradiction. To dispatch her fourth and strangest mistake first, though: Sarah Sakha is quite wrong to say that we couldn’t legalize marijuana without “fiscal liberalism.” In other words, she implies, not arresting, not judging and not imprisoning buyers and sellers of drugs would be terribly expensive. But whatever your views on drugs policy, it must surely be clear that it would be far, far cheaper to declare a truce in the trillion-dollar War on Drugs. The same is true in respect of another example in the same article, so-called gay rights. Or it would be if the writer thought of this as some liberals and many libertarians do, which is that marriage — gay, straight or otherwise — is no concern of the government’s at all but rather a matter for consenting adults to make such choices as they see fit, in the context of church, synagogue, temple or mosque, or indeed of none of these. How expensive would it be for the authorities not to interfere, not to regulate, not to favour one life choice or morality over another? In her article, Ms Sakha also says such “socially liberal” aspirations as a welfare state and universal healthcare are impossible without “big government.” This may, for all I know, be true. But for the libertarian objects of her scorn, Soviet-style socialist health and welfare provision is not what they mean by social liberalism. Libertarians want freedom, in all areas of life. Freedom to marry (or not to marry) as they please, freedom to smoke, eat, drink or inject what they want, freedom to own private property immune from forfeiture, freedom to buy and sell and give and exchange without the need to ask permission from anyone not properly concerned. Not because libertarians necessarily take a particular view on sexual ethics or marijuana. Libertarians take a particular view on liberty. And if a libertarian disagrees with you, on any of these questions, she will try to use persuasion to appeal to you rather than legislation to force you. The error stems from a false division between the social and the economic realm. Is healthcare a social matter or an economic one, or both? A more useful taxonomy is between consent and coercion, and using this language, it is clear that, far from representing a “glaring paradox,” libertarian principles are elegant and consistent. Here it is interesting to compare British and American English. (Two countries divided by a common language, George Bernard Shaw is supposed to have said.) In the UK, the word “liberal” means, or used to mean, “concerned with limiting the scope and power of government so as to enlarge the freedoms individuals can enjoy.” So we still scratch our heads in this country when we hear of “liberals” in the U.S. who want the government to tax things more, to take more of people’s money, to constrain more choices, to ban more things, to regulate more of people’s behavior. In an earlier time, your philosophers and statesmen taught the world that we could throw off the oppressor’s heavy boot; that governments ought to rule for the people’s benefit; that we must be vigilant to withstand the natural tendencies of governments to overreach the just and proper limits of their power and expand their claims and dominate their citizens. You sent your young men to die in our European struggle against tyranny. “Socially liberal, fiscally conservative” seems an awkward, clumsy designation, but it is entirely consistent. More than this, it is a noble aspiration. Let freedom ring. Martin Cox|~|Director, John Locke Institute, Oxford 
74005|~|The selfishness of success|~|   November 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Coy Ozias|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“To be successful, you have to be selfish or else you never achieve. And once you get to your highest level, then you have to be unselfish. Stay reachable. Stay in touch. Don’t isolate.” —Michael Jordan I’m a selfish person. In fact, I think many of us had to be selfish in order to become students at the University. The highly competitive Ivy League schools accept only a small fraction of students among a pool of superstars. In order to become one of the lucky few admitted, we had to spend a lot of time developing ourselves. To get the grades and SAT scores that we needed to get in, we had to spend hours locked up in our bedrooms poring over textbooks and practice tests. Could this time have been spent in the service of others? Probably. Rather than taking the SAT five times, we could have used those weekends to tutor less fortunate students. Instead of practicing our sports for hours every day, we could have used that time to volunteer at soup kitchens or with Habitat for Humanity. Society seems to support the idea that selfishness is an inherently bad trait. Starting when we are very young, our parents urge us to share with others and not be selfish. Many times, narcissistic people are labeled as selfish. However, I think one can still be a moral person while being selfish. People often measure others’ moral character based on how generous or selfless they are. But I have come to realize, as Michael Jordan’s quote states, that selfishness is needed for one to be successful, and it shouldn’t be looked down upon. Selfishness motivates individuals to achieve their goals. If they want to get to the top, or if their goals are to be exceptional athletes, they need to be selfish. To be at Princeton, you have to be the best in whatever you do — athletics, music, creating a company when you’re still in high school — whatever it is. In order to do these extraordinary things, you have to put yourself first. These goals need to come before all others in order for you to achieve. Once you build yourself up in terms of education and then later career and financial stability, you are then better equipped to contribute to others. Our previous selfishness for the sake of success is largely justified so that we can become better at being unselfish later. If we never think of ourselves first, we will never make it to leadership positions that may actually allow us to help others on a broader scale. However, there is a distinction between a selfish person and a mean person that often gets blurred in society’s view of selfishness. Mean people take any chance they can to exploit others and advance themselves. Selfish people put themselves and their goals first without taking advantage of those around them. While a degree of selfishness is needed for admission to a place like Princeton, I think once we are here, we can begin to turn our attention to others. As Michael Jordan stated, once we achieve success, we must become unselfish. It is easy to be admitted to the University and quickly begin the selfish drive to achieve admission to grad school or a high-paying career in the same way that characterized some of our high school days. While I do acknowledge that many students volunteered extensively in high school, I believe there are still some, like me, who focused mostly on their own success. A recent column in The Daily Princetonian by Ryan Dukeman urged students to take advantage of the “honeymoon period” while on campus. In many ways, once freshmen begin classes, we have achieved the success we so desperately worked for. This doesn’t mean we stop being motivated and end our desire to succeed. I simply suggest spending a little more time in the service of others during our time at Princeton. As Dukeman noted, junior and senior years are largely filled with the typical selfish pursuits of finding a job or internship. Albeit selfish, these pursuits are necessary for one to achieve their high personal and professional goals. However, as freshmen and sophomores, I believe we have an opportunity to enjoy our success and give back to the community at the same time. So if you want, go on a Breakout trip, volunteer to tutor local kids or become a Community Action leader. Sure, this may take time away from your studies, but during this honeymoon period, I think this sacrifice becomes acceptable and necessary. Within a few years, we will be back to the rat race of finding a job. So for now, enjoy the honeymoon, and use this special time to give back.|~|Coy Ozias is a freshman from Christiansburg, Va.

74002|~|Just keep scrolling|~|   November 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“And this is why freshmen should be forever banned from writing opinion pieces.” This type of comment frequents the comments section on the The Daily Princetonian website below articles written by freshmen. A single opinion piece that presents an argument that is completely incongruous with your own opinion seems to warrant such a comment. And the easiest leverage over the author turns out to be an attack on an extraneous factor — being a freshman. Surprisingly enough, freshmen do write, and we do have opinions. And we have as much a right — and should have as much an opportunity — to share these opinions. Undoubtedly, our perspective may differ drastically from that of someone who has attended the University for four years, but that difference does not and should not discount our perspective. In fact, our different perspective is important to be heard in that we present new, fresh views on issues accepted as norms. Such disparities in opinion are expected and welcomed and should serve as the basis of discussion and debate. After all, the purpose of writing — not limited to just opinion writing — should be to encourage discourse, and the comments section on online pieces provides the perfect platform where constructive criticism and opposing viewpoints can be shared. But in the status quo, constructive criticism is a rarity. If you scroll below any ‘Prince’ article online (particularly in the opinion section) and read through the comments at the bottom of it, chances are you’ll run into a couple of really condescending, contemptuous even malicious comments, at the very least — comments that choose not to criticize the argument(s) being made in the piece, but to denigrate the person making the argument. That being said, such comments are not singular to the ‘Prince.’ They pervade news sources and forums all over the Internet. Nonetheless, we have the capacity to address — and decrease — the frequency with which such comments appear within the University community. I have one question for people who make such personal attacks: Why? What purpose does your derogatory comment serve? What point do you hope to get across? Is such a comment even necessary? Ad hominem attacks on the author are completely unwarranted and can be excessively disparaging. Writers can be (and have been) censured for being misguided and/or simply unintelligent with pejorative comments that unfairly cast aspersions on their characters, and if it’s a freshman writer, then on their age. Often, this can border on cyberbullying. If the argument and person making the argument are to be considered one entity as the subject of criticism, then criticism is invited only if it has a fair warrant. Differences in belief and perspective are important, arising from differences in our diverse backgrounds, experiences and upbringings, which is why they should be shared. And, well, the Internet is free, and you have the freedom to say what you want. However, writers are held to a certain standard; likewise, commenters should be held to such a standard. The language of criticism is important to consider. An article coupled with the comments below it provides for a pseudo-forum, and a certain degree of civility and decorum is expected. Everyone — writers and commenters alike — should exercise respect and judiciousness in what they say. Comments are an asset to journalism and discussion as unfiltered opinion, helping to facilitate discourse and invite variance. But the ability to offer dissent anonymously should be viewed as a privilege — a privilege people exploit far too often by using abrasive language and/or vilifying the author. Personal attacks not only detract from the articles (and from the comment itself), but they can polarize and negatively influence audiences. This ultimately engenders a negative comment culture and harms the University community when we strive for an open campus that supports and fosters multilateral conversation, whether it be in speech or in writing.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

73999|~|Editorial: Bring back the campus pub |~|   November 23 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|It is high time that the campus pub of old be restored. From 1973 through 1983, what is now Chancellor Green Café was a popular place for Princeton faculty and students to go for a pint after class. Of course, back in those good old days, the drinking age in New Jersey was 18 rather than 21, and there wasn’t the inconvenient upperclassman-underclassman divide there is today. It is no coincidence that the campus pub was closed in 1984, the same year that New Jersey upped the legal imbibing age. Yet closing the pub was a mistake, and today there seems to be no disagreement: Princetonians — students, faculty and administrators — hope for the return of the campus pub. In the spring of 2011, the Working Group on Campus Social and Residential Life issued a report unanimously recommending the reestablishment of the campus pub. Only the logistics remained to be negotiated. A steering committee was formed. Locations were discussed. Café Vivian in Frist Campus Center was selected. In November 2012, the University sought a license from the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control for the project. And then things fizzled out. Two years have elapsed, and no additional progress appears to have been made. This is disappointing. Allow us to help with the logistical minutiae to accelerate the process. We propose that the campus pub be restored to its former glory in the same location it occupied 30 years ago. Chancellor Green Café is the best location, certainly better than the formerly proposed Café Vivian location: Chancellor Green Café is central on campus, has a healthier distance from the Street than Café Viv and isn’t in that monolithic and multipurpose structure known as Frist, which would fog much of the potential benefit of the creation of a special gathering space. The atmosphere of Chancellor Green Café seems most conducive to a pub, provided the appropriate renovations to give it the right wood-paneled tap-room feel. As a part of East Pyne, it would have a neat, old-school location, and, unlike Café Vivian, it wouldn’t be swallowed up by the campus center circus. There are other worries. The current drinking age is still a general nuisance but one that must be accommodated — at least until New Jersey asserts its right to change it back to 18. All Princetonians should be welcomed at the pub. The chief appeal of the campus pub, of course, is the provision of fine alcoholic beverage. Nevertheless, we suggest that pub food and non-alcoholic drinks be offered as well, making the pub an attraction for all University students. As with residential college upperclassman socials, two forms of identification (prox and state-issued) should be required to purchase alcohol. We further suggest that Princetonians be able to welcome two non-Princetonian guests. The campus pub should ideally open around 4:30 p.m., just in time for students to take a professor or preceptor to happy hour, and remain open until midnight or so. Thursdays and Saturdays should have later closing times, given the nature of the University’s weekly social schedule. During the rest of the day, the location could continue to function as a café. To ensure reasonable pricing for good quality beer and wine, the pub could be operated chiefly by well-trained student bartenders. This would allow the University to hire more student workers as well. The reinstated campus pub would be more than just another nice Princeton amenity. It would contribute to two important University ends: community and virtue cultivation. The University is a community of scholars sharing in intellectual engagement and friendship that are only fully possible through personal interaction. A campus pub would provide an excellent place to foster such communal conviviality among students and faculty outside of the classroom. Second, the pub would encourage virtue though responsible social alcohol consumption. It would stand as a healthy alternative to the binge drinking that often results from dorm pregaming. As a venue for the intermingling of classes, clubs, faculty and students and for responsible drinking, the campus pub would serve the University well. Today begins Undergraduate Student Government elections, and on the ballot, you will notice two referenda. The second asks, “Shall the undergraduates urge the administration to reestablish a campus pub?” Naturally, the answer should be a resounding “yes.” We hope that the University will move the ball forward, so we won’t be writing this same editorial yet again in another two years.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief.

73871|~|When it's okay to be offensive |~|   November 20 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I recently learned how to play Cards Against Humanity, and anyone who has ever played the game can probably attest to the perverse nature of the topics that inevitably arise. Many (actually most) of the cards are mildly (or more than mildly) racist, offensive or demeaning. In my particular game, several of the more memorable rounds involved the Three-Fifths Compromise, midgets and plenty of not-so-subtle sexual innuendos, none of which is suitable for print in a respectable publication like this. And yet, in spite of the obviously offensive nature of the game, we were able to laugh the hardest at some of the most blatantly distasteful rounds. Lo and behold, in the midst of holding back tears, no one called us out for being discriminatory bigots, or for being uncultured philistines who took pleasure in abusing irreverent topics. On campus over the past few weeks, there has been a lot of talk about the relatively recent movie Dear White People, which, I admit, I have yet to see; but from what I’ve gathered by talking to others (and from reading IMDB), the film employs satire and comedy to discuss racial identity and to highlight the discriminatory racial undertones that still plague our modern society. To me, this seemed similar in nature to Cards Against Humanity. In both the film and the game, players and audience members are able to get a good laugh at the expense of a traditionally taboo topic – whether it be race or some other equally sticky, generally avoided subject. And, while the viewers or the players are having a good laugh, the reality of the problem is also brought to light, albeit in a comical yet nonetheless effective way. After all, how better to spread a memorable message than to have people laugh about it? In this way, there seems to be an increasingly polarizing effect on our society in general. On one hand, there are people who are overtly willing to express their offensive and bigoted beliefs with the sole purpose of insulting; they want to shock and titillate, and they don’t care about how others feel about it. Case in point: YouTube commenters, or any anonymous Internet user in general, for that matter. On the other hand, the specter of political correctness and the need to appear as deferential as possible has, for most of us, encouraged us to watch and inhibit our more extreme sentiments in favor of more watered-down but safer expressions and statements. We say “African American” instead of black, “Native American” instead of Indian; we are not supposed comment on people’s weights, ages, appearances, habits or beliefs; and so on and so forth. While this may help us avoid conflict, it also hampers honest conversation of the topics that are suppressed. In today’s world, it can be difficult to distinguish when we cross the border between being funny and being mean. It’s hard to tell which topics we can safely make fun of, and which ones we should avoid at the risk of appearing insensitive and cruel. But as the hilarious game of Cards Against Humanity showed me, and, I suspect, as the film showed many others, humor is a great medium through which to broach typically distasteful topics. What’s more, humor is ubiquitous – there is something (probably offensive but nonetheless funny) to say about everyone; about every culture, every race, every religion and every creed. And when we try to avoid or isolate specific groups of people to protect them, we may be acting counterproductively. Instead of moving them out of harm’s way, we may be hurting them more by isolating them, rendering them untouchable, and as a result, unable to bring to light the individuality (and, yes, the funniness) of the differences that make them so unique. If humor is a tool, it is one that should be used freely by everyone, against everyone – when that becomes realized, humor will cease to be the oftentimes awkward and offensive concept it is today. Dialogue, debate and discussion are all certainly important ways in which we can strive to identify and ameliorate the problems that face our world. But maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to throw in a stand-up comedy routine along the way.|~|Jason Choe is a sophomore from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. He can be reached at jasonjc@princeton.edu. 
73781|~|Editorial: Cheng for President, Czulak for Vice President|~|   November 20 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The Undergraduate Student Government will be holding general elections from Monday Nov. 24 to Wednesday Nov. 26. Our student government is a resource with great potential, but USG can only have an effective presence on campus if we as students take the time to select the representatives who will earnestly engage with the needs of the community and work effectively to follow through on the tasks undertaken on behalf of the student body. This year there are three candidates for president: Ella Cheng ’16, William Gansa ’17, and Molly Stoneman ’16; and two for vice president: Aleksandra Czulak ’17 and Dallas Nan ’16. Every year, this Board endorses one candidate for the office of president and one for vice president. This year, we endorse Cheng for president and Czulak for vice president. The office of the president calls for vision, in order to set the direction of the student government, and for effective management, in order to make sure it stays on track. Cheng has the experience and competence necessary for the position. Cheng has served in the USG Senate since freshman year and currently serves as the University Student Life Committee Chair. In this capacity, she has managed dozens of different projects, from improving residential common areas to running the summer storage initiative. Her broad administrative experience has helped her form a vision of what USG can do to better serve the student community, including encouraging informative communication between USG and students and vice versa. Cheng has centered on a plan to “put the ‘U’ back in USG” by improving communication between USG and students, both to make sure that projects are addressing real student issues and to keep USG accountable by showing students the progress on policy projects that are underway. The vice president is in charge of maintaining the internal structure and operation of USG and has to be able to keep project members accountable, and Czulak demonstrates the energy and insight needed to carry out this task. She has spent the last year as Executive Secretary of USG, which was an opportunity to work side-by-side with the current president and vice president while playing an active role in weekly USG operations. In her current position, she has had the responsibility of preparing the agenda for weekly USG meetings and has attended biweekly Executive Committee meetings, all of which have provided the exposure necessary for familiarity with the role of the vice president. Czulak has set three main goals – feedback, visibility and accountability – and has targeted practical points such as improving internal communication between elected and appointed USG members and producing more visible and engaging midyear reports. There are many other contested positions on this year’s ballot, and we encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with the candidates and their ideas and to vote in the upcoming elections. Next year, we need a USG that has the perspective on how to improve its services for students and that will keep these efforts active and accountable. Ella Cheng and Aleksandra Czulak have the necessary skills and experience, and we urge you all to vote for them. Note: Gansa declined to speak with the Editorial Board. Jeffrey Leibenhaut ’16, Cydney Kim ’17, Kevin Wong ’17 and Connor Pfeiffer ’18 were recused from the presidential endorsement due to conflicts of interest. Mitchell Johnston ’15, James Haynes ’18 and Connor Pfeiffer ’18 were recused from the vice presidential endorsement due to conflicts of interest.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief.

The authors, anticipating such criticism, write that “the State of Israel has been singled out as the recipient of unparalleled amounts of unconditional U.S. military aid, and American diplomatic support effectively exempts Israel from compliance with international law.” They added that “many governments violate human rights, but in few other cases do Americans and American institutions have such leverage to enact positive changes on the ground.” But is it true that Israel is more susceptible to U.S. pressure than other human rights violators? Or perhaps the companies that profit from Israel’s crimes have unique leverage over Israel? The petition is silent on these critical questions. Meanwhile, Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Morocco, Jordan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Qatar, Iraq, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Honduras, the United Arab Emirates and Kyrgyzstan all routinely receive diplomatic, military and financial assistance from the United States. Many are close allies. Most are ruled by dictators who imprison, torture and kill political opponents. In Bahrain, peaceful, pro-democracy activists gathered at the Pearl Roundabout in Manama in February 2011, demanding the government put an end to torture and discrimination and release political activists. In response, the Bahraini government, with the assistance of another critical American ally, Saudi Arabia, slaughtered dozens, arrested more than 2,900 people, at least five of whom died from torture. Twelve peaceful, pro-democracy activists are spending the rest of their lives in prison. Meanwhile, in 2012, the United States government decided to resume arms sales to Bahrain. In Egypt, on Aug. 14, 2013, the military raided two protests at al-Nahda Square and the Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.  They slaughtered at least 817 people in a few hours, in what Human Rights Watch described as “the most serious incident of mass unlawful killings in modern Egyptian history.” And yet, even after the mass slaughter, nearly 2,000 tons of critical U.S. military equipment continued to flow to Egyptian ports, while the U.S. 2014 fiscal year budget included $1.5 billion in aid to Egypt, $1.3 billion of which was earmarked for military spending. (The U.S. gave $3.1 billion to Israel in 2014.) The U.S. itself has killed an estimated 258 to 951 civilians in Pakistan alone, including 168 to 200 children. Amnesty International has “serious concerns” that many U.S. drone strikes have constituted war crimes, including extrajudicial executions, arbitrary deprivation of life and deliberately attacking civilians rescuing the wounded. So why single out companies complicit in Israel’s crimes but not Egypt’s, Bahrain’s or the United States’? Is the University is an institution whose mission it is to promote peace and justice in Israel and Palestine? Is the University more likely to support divestment there rather than elsewhere? Are the authors of the petition  part of the nonexistent Department of Palestine Studies, or an Israel-Palestine studies reading group or carry Israeli passports, thus granting them a special obligation to focus on Israel? Is the University located in Israel and therefore carries a special obligation to divest from companies who profit from its own government’s crimes first?  If the answer to any of these questions had been yes, then I might have supported the petition. But in each case, the answer appears to be no. Again, why Israel? And why does the petition target only tenured faculty? Why did the authors of the petition wait until they got tenure to write it? If this is about human rights, then why did their activism have to wait until they received tenure? Obviously divestment only from companies that profit from Israel’s crimes is not just a human rights issue but also a political issue.  The authors of the petition knew this very well, which is why they waited for their tenure decisions to write it. This is, fundamentally, why divestment initiatives continue to meet with failure on every college campus in the country, as universities tend to avoid politicizing themselves. (This differentiates them from churches, for instance.) The authors cite successful divestment initiatives in South Africa and Sudan but fail to realize that Israel is not the same kind of international pariah that South Africa under Apartheid and genocidal Sudan were, like it or not. It might be in five or 10 years, but it is not today. Ironically, divestment initiatives have flourished, in part, because even in the occupied West Bank, where the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement first originated, there is a modicum of freedom of expression. One wonders what would happen to Egyptian, Bahraini or Saudi Arabian activists if they were to launch a similar initiative. So let’s be smart about divestment. The international climate is not where it needs to be to single out Israel in the same way universities singled out South Africa and Sudan. I applaud the authors and signatories of the petition for making Israel’s human rights violations a matter of public debate at the University, but as individuals who have benefited immensely from the size of our endowment and the prestige our apolitical university affords us, we need to think much more strategically about ethical investing. As for faculty in the Near Eastern Studies department, why not start with the Middle East? That would silence the criticism of singling out Israel but still keep the petition focused on specific targets. And, as authorities on the Middle East, the University will respect your concern for the Middle East rather than wonder about which ulterior motives led you to single out Israel. Why head down the well-trodden path of failure? If you failed to convince me – an ideological ally – do you think you are going to persuade the University to politicize itself?|~|Zachary Foster is a Ph.D. student in Near Eastern Studies.

73674|~|Making time to meet new people|~|   November 19 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jonathan Lu|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|After letting the first few weeks of the semester slip by from procrastination, I realized that I had to work more efficiently. I camped out in the library. I began power walking to classes. I reduced dinner to 15 minutes of shoveling food in my mouth. I rethought this behavior after a conversation with a sophomore friend. “I don’t think that people should act so busy all the time. People should make time to talk over dinner. What’s worth more: a few extra minutes of studying or the company of another human being?” At Princeton, we all block out time. However, after getting accustomed to allotting half an hour for this problem set and 50 minutes for that paper, we risk quantifying people and experiences as well. Study break? Nope, not when there’s a computer science problem set I could be doing. Murray-Dodge Café? I need to do extra reading for my seminar. Student event? Is that productive in any way? Despite the other words, meeting new people is productive, if not in an academic way. Spending time with new people is a way of learning that goes beyond reading Chaucer or chatting with old friends. It helps us better understand ourselves and learn to interact with different people. Spending time with people in the same major or with the same interests never forces us to question our priorities. Why am I a physics major? Why do I want to go into medicine? Whether choosing a class, an activity or a career path, we always benefit from the perspective of an outsider. Meeting people forces us to rethink our priorities. Studying is easy. Busy work is easy. Holing up in our comfort zones, surrounding ourselves with like-minded people, is easy. Searching to better understand ourselves is much harder. Moreover, every activity, every problem, every theorem, every thesis, every paper, every job or career, was thought up and created by humans. We can drown ourselves in our books, but we need to work with others in order to accomplish anything of merit. These people won’t have the same personalities or motivations as we do. Meeting people isn’t being unproductive — it’s preparing ourselves to work with others and to make an impact. Finally, and most importantly, we have the wonderful opportunity at Princeton to meet people with all sorts of interests and cares. However, being in such a diverse place is pointless if everyone self-segregates. This is the only time in our lives that meeting such different people completely will be so easy. Where can we meet people? In a survey I conducted with 11 people, the majority mentioned Frist Campus Center — particularly Late Meal — and Murray-Dodge as “cool places to hang out” and “get to know people.” Relaxed atmospheres, happy people and lots of calories — no better conditions for striking up conversations with random people. Other places mentioned were the dining hall, residential college common rooms, the gym, study breaks, the Street, the University Art Museum, the Pace Center for Civic Engagement and student-organized events. Aside from specific places, one senior told me: “Try out new extracurriculars and reach out to people. Sit down with random freshmen at lunch. You’re still in the high-acceptance phase of freshman year, so take advantage of that!” Freshmen: we have the time and freedom to meet new people. Before we throw ourselves into the race for success in classes, research, internships and job applications, let’s keep exploring. We’re only one-sixteenth of our way through Princeton, but we are nowhere close to knowing one-sixteenth of our fellow Princetonians. Let’s make time to be open. Let’s make time for new people.|~|Jonathan Lu is a freshman from Fremont, Calif. He can be reached at jhlu@princeton.edu. 
73573|~|The mindfulness of micropractice|~|   November 19 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Significant change is scary. Whether it’s the new year or the old year, it’s hard for us to commit to changing. I’ve consistently sworn every new year to read more, lose weight, stress less and study harder. I commit to big things. Run three miles every day! Read a book every month! Meditate for an hour every night! Get straight As! However, as soon as I break the new and improved — and imaginary — cycle, I blame myself and resolve to do better — 365 days later. I set my alarm dutifully, write cleanly on neon Post-its I’ll stick in plain sight and put reminders into my calendar. I write resolutions in my notebook or on the corner of my laptop because, theoretically, those are places I can’t avoid. I can. I’ll keep them about a month, until finals week hits, and I brush away my confidence and admit defeat. We are all striving to keep our sanity, kindness and sleep balanced. Instead of viewing lost commitments as failures, why not treat commitment the same way we’ve learned to be successful in every other area, by starting small? I call it “micropractice,” although it’s not my copyright. I learned it from a workshop hosted by Chris McKenna, program director of Mindful Schools. Micropractice is simple: believe you can better yourself during minute-long intervals. Basically, don’t settle for a self-imposed status quo. Snap yourself in and out of mindfulness and, in the process, train yourself to commit to better practices. If the journey of 1,000 miles begins with the first step, so does the journey of achieving any goal. We should commit to appreciating one’s ability to breathe, running for five minutes, reading one page, instead of getting frustrated with unrealistic expectations and hating ourselves if we cannot cross far away finish lines. As the semester’s impending end fills us with self-doubt, let’s remember to give ourselves a break. Micropractice can work for anyone, as it suggests setting your commitment to yourself and to no one else. Appreciate the vivid, fleeting color of the leaves, the smell of (relatively) fresh coffee in Frist Campus Center or the patience of a teaching assistant who replies to a frantic email. Understand and forgive yourself for oversleeping, skipping the gym or putting off that essay to daydream an hour longer. Believe that small changes beget medium changes which beget big changes, and that domino effect is yours to tip in your favor if you begin, humbly, with one. Of course, I cannot say that meditation is for everyone, but I do believe that micropractice is. Whatever your goals are, be they running marathons, reading novels or applying to jobs, start small. Micropractice is both about setting reasonable goals and forgiving yourself for not achieving the big ones. I argue these are one and the same. Sixty seconds of mindfulness per day sustains me for, at the very least, the forthcoming couple of minutes. If I remember to emotionally photograph five minutes of my day, I feel like a rock star. If I forget, well, remembering that I did forget reminds me to remember again in the first place. Every person owns the forthcoming moment; it is in our power to ask what it wants. It wants to be remembered for brightening your day, for reminding you to take a deep breath of Blair Arch air, for closing your eyes to the insecurity of feeling smaller than your peers, for enjoying the unintended nap in those dangerously soporofic East Pyne chairs. Feel indulgent about small changes in order to pride yourself with the bigger ones, because our time here is too short to keep feeling like we are less than we can be.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

73593|~|Steps in the right direction|~|   November 19 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|The Princeton Perspective Project was recently launched in effort to combat the perception of “effortless perfection” on campus. This is an important step that the Undergraduate Student Government has taken to resolve an issue that was never heavily addressed before. However, there has been a lot of backlash and criticism directed toward it. Perhaps it is imperfect in execution, but it deserves to be seen as a positive addition to our culture rather than a mistaken endeavor. As a freshman, I wrote about the disparity I saw between the image people project and the reality they are living. People were, and are still, saying that they wrote papers at the last minute when they were actually working on them for a week. People are still talking about how much they go out and party without worrying about their schoolwork, and how they really didn’t try all that hard for that test they aced. When people waved their seemingly effortless achievements like flags, it was easy for me to think, “What am I doing wrong?” And even worse, what was wrong with me? It’s true that a lot of people here have a natural proclivity for certain subjects, or writing papers, or taking tests. But to think that the majority of people could do what I poured my efforts into without a second thought is wrong. There is a certain normality on this campus to concealing how much effort we put in or how much work we do so that we aren’t seen as try-hards, but as effortlessly perfect. That kind of attitude may give the appearance that we are flawless and that everything is under control, but it is only counterproductive because it does not motivate or inspire — it demoralizes. Instead of showing us that struggle is common and that it can be dealt with and overcome, it encourages us to bury it. As a junior, I’m more used to distinguishing what is real and what is fake, but it was not so easy for me as a freshman. And, going through freshman year — my first year experiencing college classes, my first year living away from home, my first year being thrust into a dorm of strangers and trying to make some friends — thinking that I was undeserving of being here because I couldn’t be as perfect as everyone else, was difficult. The Princeton Perspective Project is a real, concrete step that our campus has never taken before. There have been retreats during school breaks that focus on facilitating open dialogue between students, but never a school-wide effort, and never an initiative to bring this seemingly intangible, wishy-washy, feelings-laden issue, to the forefront of things we should actually be addressing. Just because the “normality of perfection” is immeasurable, doesn’t mean it isn’t important. There are still ways that the Princeton Perspective Project could improve upon its method of spreading its message. Currently, one method it is employing is having volunteers put up Facebook profile pictures in support of the project. The pictures are all attractive, well-lit pictures of people smiling — just tilted a few degrees. Sure, the pictures do show a new, rotated perspective, but the picture itself still looks pretty perfect. It doesn’t symbolize a new perspective to me, just the old perspective, sort of shifted. It’s just part of the social media campaign to bring awareness to the project itself, but it also sends a different message to people than it intends to, which may be a reason that people are hesitant to welcome the project immediately from the start. Another way the project tries to change campus culture is by having people share their stories on videos on the website, which is good because it features real people sharing their real experiences. On the other hand, the videos are self-selective. Upperclassmen who are brave or outgoing enough to propagate their stories to the entire student body are present in the videos, but that’s not relatable to introverts or underclassmen who don’t even know where to begin. I think a major step the Princeton Perspective Project could take is allowing anonymous essays. They would be edited to ensure that they are respectful, but they would also be more truthful because people would be more willing to share their honest experiences. The Princeton Perspective Project is new, and perhaps students are not accustomed to it yet, or the members of the project are still figuring out ways to convey a concrete message, but it’s still an important — and very welcome — step in the right direction.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

73454|~|Student silence on pending mental health lawsuit |~|   November 18 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|Last month, The Daily Princetonian published University documents from a pending lawsuit against the University for its forced “voluntary” withdrawal of a student with mental health issues. And there was little to no student reaction. Unfortunately, by now it isn’t astounding to me that Princeton students are largely ignoring important, student-related issues in their regular conversations. But even so, it is strange to see how little student attention has been given to the ongoing lawsuit against the University regarding discrimination due to mental health concerns given that students have already identified this as a critical concern. Given how salient an issue mental health has been on campus and nationally in recent months, I figured that this would be an issue about which people are passionate and engaged. Last March, when the student filed this lawsuit alleging discrimination by the University on the basis of mental illness, another student wrote an op-ed criticizing the University’s policy that requires students to waive confidentiality in order to be readmitted after leaving for mental health reasons. In fact, there were numerous ‘Prince’ columns on the University’s flawed policies. There was enough discussion that even the administration was prompted to do something — they hosted town halls on mental health around campus. Yet despite the recent news coverage of the developments of the lawsuit against the University, there seems to be little discussion, either inside or outside the ‘Prince,’ other than about whether the student filing the lawsuit should be allowed to remain anonymous. (That story did result in a number of student comments, mainly in favor of the student plaintiff remaining anonymous. There have been no response opinion columns on the lawsuit this semester, however.) There has been nearly no attention regarding the student’s initial decision to represent himself or the publication of the documents the University sent to the student. The publication of similar documents last spring created such a stir — why didn’t these? These documents appear to demonstrate that the University has a “one-size-fits-all” policy regarding required withdrawals for mental health issues, draconian rules for lack of contact with the University while on leave and a broad-brush requirement for the waiving of confidentiality in regards to mental health records for reinstatement to the University. I’d love be able to suggest that perhaps the reason we aren’t paying more attention to this is because we are too busy talking about other critical issues, like the changes to the sexual misconduct policy, but I, unfortunately, know better than that. Perhaps it’s the reality that a ruling in this lawsuit in the student’s favor has the potential to create drastic changes. Writing in the ‘Prince’ is a great form of activism and has the potential to spark conversation among students and administrators, like what happened last spring. However, it doesn’t really have the potential to spark major policy changes that the University might oppose due to rational self-interest. Winning a discrimination lawsuit does. Regrettably, students here just don’t want to align themselves with a radical overhaul of University policy — not until after it wins at least. People are not willing to put their heads on the line, even if in a supportive role. The University has a reputation for adhering to the norm; students generally do not create waves in social and cultural standards. Those who do choose to take action tend to be ridiculed. So, really, this apathy should not be all that surprising. In fact, it was the same way in the 1980s when Sally Frank sued Ivy Club and Tiger Inn for refusing to admit women. She faced ridicule from her peers for doing something that could — and eventually did — make a difference. Now, of course, Sally Frank is treated as a hero by most of our generation — someone to admire and respect. And perhaps the same will occur with this student and this case if the student were to win and the University’s mental health policies were adapted to better serve students. Perhaps this case will even lead to a new standard policy nationally. I, for one, hope that the student wins and that the University overhauls its mental health policies. We should be voicing our support for the student for speaking out and trying to create change, but no matter how one views the case and the issue, it’s imperative that students at least realize that this is potentially a huge game changer and that it deserves their attention and consideration. Hopefully, the upcoming Undergraduate Student Government referendum to urge the administration to publish the detailed and official policies for undergraduate withdrawal and readmission for mental health reasons will pass, rekindling the mental health reform efforts around campus. And, hopefully, the administration will see this as a mandate and that publishing this information will lead to further engagement and change.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

73464|~|We need to be able to leave our colleges |~|   November 18 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|In 2007, the University started its expanded residential college system, which entails that freshmen and sophomores must live in the residential college assigned to them in the summer before they arrive at the University. Additionally, they must buy the associated meal plan (although anyone with a meal plan can eat in any college). The intention of this system is to foster a sense of community among smaller subdivisions of the Princeton population. It is my belief that allowing people to change residential colleges before their sophomore year would help to realize this goal more effectively. Princeton students stay in their colleges for two years so that they continue to eat and attend study breaks with the same people in order to build a community. However, different colleges have dramatically different levels of community spirit and loyalty. For example, Butler College is centrally located, so people from all colleges use its common areas. This means that students in Butler are not necessarily always seeing the same faces the way a student in Forbes College might. Essentially, the college system is not enough, on its own, to build a community. Other factors, such as geographical isolation, are also apparently necessary. If students picked their own colleges after freshman year, there would be a stronger sense of community by virtue of the fact that the colleges were deliberately picked. A student in a college would know that most other sophomores had chosen to be there with them. Students would also feel a greater connection to their colleges because they would have picked the one most suited to their personal needs. For example, someone might value the up-campus location and Gothic architecture of Rockefeller College or Mathey College, or they might decide they like the central location and amenities of Butler or the small, homey feeling of Forbes. Of course, there are limited spots in every college, but this problem could easily be decided through the existing lottery system. The only difference is that all rising sophomores would enter the same room draw rather than being divided by college. People would receive favorable or unfavorable positions purely by luck, just as they do now. If the University still wanted to have the continuity of living in the same place for two years, it could incentivize staying in your native college by giving people who remain in their colleges better spots on the list. In this way, if you don’t feel like your college fits you, you can still easily leave. However, there is also still a good reason to stay. Either way, you would have a choice, and choosing is what would make the community stronger. This change would also give more people the opportunity to make the best choices in roommates for sophomore year. Although the small size of the University’s student population combined with the advisee group system ensures that almost all students have friends in their respective colleges, that doesn’t mean that everyone finds the best roommate in their respective colleges. It is not uncommon to have a best friend in another college. It could significantly improve some people’s standard of living if they could choose from a larger pool of potential roommates. It seems unfair to limit arbitrarily the people with whom students can live to people who happened to be randomly placed in the same residential college as them. In any case, continuing to mandate the meal plan for freshmen and sophomores would ensure that there is an underlying sense of community. Most underclassmen eat in all of the college dining halls. The way we use the dining halls to socialize and connect would not significantly change if we were allowed to leave our colleges after freshman year. We could only benefit from being allowed a little more freedom in our choice of location. The college system itself could only benefit from having engaged residents who chose to be there.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va. She can be reached at zmubarak@princeton.edu. 
73466|~|On catcalling|~|   November 18 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|I grew up in a suburb of New York City, about 15 minutes from uptown and 45 from Midtown, factoring in a plausible amount of traffic. My childhood was punctuated by dinners on the Lower East Side with my family or field trips to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with my class, but I didn’t start going into the city by myself until high school when I had to trek up to Columbia University for classes or coffee shops downtown for interviews. I don’t think I was prepared for what walking alone in New York as a female is like. I was 15 or 16 — still passably a kid — but, all of a sudden, much older men were leering down at me, making kissing noises, whistling. I’d hold my bag tighter to my body and keep walking, eyes trained down on the cement, but I’d still hear a “Hey, baby” growled under their breath. This had never happened before; when I was with my family, New York was idyllic and exotic. Alone, I felt suddenly like prey. Even nowadays, I forget what catcalling is like in the city until I’m there again. Hollaback, an organization committed to ending street harassment, recently posted a video of a woman silently walking in New York City for 10 hours. Over the course of the video, the woman receives countless catcalls from dozens of men though she isn’t doing anything particularly evocative. At first glance, it might seem absurd that a woman could warrant so much lascivious attention for doing nothing, but the video actually accurately reflects the extent of street harassment in New York. Almost any woman familiar with the area would feel it hit home. Unsurprisingly, many men were not pleased with the portrayal of catcalling as predatory. A notable example was Steve Santagati, self-proclaimed guru for women’s thoughts and desires, who defended catcallers in a CNN segment aired about the video. “There’s nothing more that a woman loves to hear than how pretty she is,” Santagati maintained. His statements, though misguided, reflect the rationale behind most men who catcall. Most men don’t mean to be lecherous creeps. They think they’re being nice. What isn’t nice, after all, about being told that you’re beautiful by a stranger? The problem is really twofold. The first is straightforward. A city street isn’t a museum, and women aren’t pieces. Women aren’t on display, asking to be evaluated. A man’s opinion on a woman’s aesthetic on any particular day is unwanted and unwarranted. It’s arrogant to think that a woman needs to hear what a man thinks about something she’s not offering for public consumption. Further, even benign complements aren’t benign — if they were, there would be more heterosexual men approaching other men with, “Let me see that smile,” or “Nice jeans.” The second follows from the first. The problem with catcalling isn’t the what so much as the where. It’s not that all women hate being complemented. After all, flirting is the basis for any romantic relationship. At a bar or a party, it is socially acceptable to say many things that would be unacceptable on the corner of 42nd and Broadway. That’s because, at a bar or party, there is an opportunity for repartee. A woman can respond and signal whether she is interested or not. There is a purpose — the potential to further an interpersonal relationship. A crass comment — or even a relatively benign comment — hurled at a woman from a car window or bench as she’s walking along is offensive because she has no time to respond. In fact, a response is often not even desired. The man isn’t trying to pursue further interaction with the woman; he’s just passing judgment on her appearance without her having the ability to turn him down. And it’s this reason that catcalls are more gritty and vulgar than a pickup line that would be used in a different context: There are no repercussions for the catcaller and no risk of rejection. A lot of this ties back to the way society has ordered heterosexual interactions: Men pursue women, and women doll themselves up to be pursued. The problem with this is that it gives men a sense of entitlement. Because of the way society is structured, men feel as if it’s their right to catcall women. This explains the more violent responses to the video, wherein men threatened to kill or rape the woman for daring to pass social commentary on the trend. Hopefully with changing times, the seemingly pressing need for men to catcall will subside as well. But, in the mean time, there’s a shockingly easy fix: If you’re a man, and you’re compelled at any point to hit on a woman walking down the street, just don’t.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a molecular biology major from Cresskill, N.J.

73324|~|Israel, Palestine and pluralism|~|   November 17 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The pluralist tradition has long been an important part of American history. Leaders have used the pluralist approach to resolve conflicts both at home and abroad, choosing to act as mediators between different groups. Rather than imposing solutions, these leaders allowed the stakeholders to mutually decide on their own answers to issues. In this way, the pluralist approach is an effective, long-term and fair way to address issues. Successes include Franklin Roosevelt’s mediation between workers and employers to end labor unrest in the 1930s and Senator George Mitchell’s role in negotiating peace in Northern Ireland in the late ’90s. Both Tigers for Israel president Sam Major ’16 and the directors of the Center for Jewish Life have argued in op-eds this year for fostering dialogue between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel advocates. In principle, this position reflects an admirable commitment to the tenets of pluralism. However, in reality, the “pro-solution” defended by Major and the CJL directors fails to promote a truly pluralistic answer to the Israeli-Palestinian controversy by continuing the anti-pluralistic status quo. In response to this issue, activism on the part of consumers, students, academics and institutions is necessary to achieve a pluralistic framework for negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Currently, the United States as a whole is far from a neutral mediator between the two sides. Instead, it is a strong advocate for Israel, providing consistent diplomatic support as well as massive military aid in the amount of approximately $3.1 billion per year since 2012 (nearly as much in one year as the $4.2 billion that the United States has provided to Palestinian organizations cumulatively since 1994). The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is obviously complex and requires a complex response from the United States. I fully realize, especially having grown up culturally Jewish, the sensitivity toward actions that may be considered harmful to Israel’s welfare. Some degree of American aid to Israel is surely necessary to ensure security and emphasize the legitimacy of the state of Israel. The state of affairs, however, calls for a meaningful change to the status quo. Today, 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza are confined under an act of war under international law to what the Princeton Committee on Palestine explains is essentially a massive open-air prison. The United Nations, working on the ground and supervising human rights groups in Gaza, estimated in August that 1,462 of the 2,104 Palestinians killed this summer (69 percent) were civilians, including 495 children and 253 women. In the West Bank, Palestinians are denied freedom of movement and face a fundamentally unfair and arbitrary justice system. Grassroots activism, like the movement to boycott, divest and impose sanctions, is necessary to counterbalance the massive, guaranteed U.S. aid to the Israeli government and the continuing profits of companies benefiting from violations of international law and violations of Palestinians’ human rights. I support specifically the calls to boycott and/or divest from those companies and academic institutions (not individuals, as Tehila Wenger inaccurately asserts in “Is Professor Weiss suppressing Israeli academia?”) that profit from the illegal occupation of the West Bank and the siege on Gaza. Most importantly, I want to emphasize that the kind of activism espoused by the BDS movement is necessary to create a pluralist framework for negotiations. As students, faculty, alumni, trustees, etc., we are not asserting a pluralist position by refraining from activism and sticking to moderating discussions. Until we take action to hold companies and institutions responsible in some way for taking advantage of violations of international law, we can only give the Palestinian perspective a symbolic seat at the table. The pro-Israeli occupation perspective continues to hold all the political and economic leverage. This situation does not allow any form of meaningful pluralism. I am aware that the directors of the CJL, an invaluable campus resource for Jews of all different backgrounds, are simply following the guidelines of Hillel International. Hillel considers any meaningful change to the status quo in U.S.-Israeli relations as “harmful” to to the state of Israel, a guideline that is intentionally vague. However, the recent faculty petition to divest specifically from “all companies that contribute to or profit from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank,” similar to the petition signed by Professor Weiss to boycott Israeli academic institutions, is an effort to reach productive, pluralistic discourse. Like the students who wrote an open letter to the CJL community and Hillel International, I find some statements made by the CJL directors troubling, such as the implication in a letter to students that the recent faculty petition supporting divestment creates an unsafe environment for Jewish students. As the writers of the open letter explain, many Jewish students are, on the contrary, afraid to voice support for divestment because they fear repercussions from the CJL community. The decision by some at the CJL to promote Hillel’s red lines in this way shuts out meaningful campus dialogue and excludes productive activist perspectives. No less important than leaders like Roosevelt and Mitchell are the grassroots activists who struggled to alter the status quo and create a truly pluralistic framework for conflict resolution — from the leaders of the bus boycott in Alabama that forced companies and officials to reconsider segregation to those who worked to spur divestment from the apartheid regime of South Africa to labor leaders whose strikes led to fair pay and reasonable hours. By embracing activism and promoting truly pluralistic discourse, we have the opportunity today to lead the way to a resolution decided upon by both the Israeli and Palestinian people.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I.

73358|~|The curious case of the 'socially liberal, fiscally conservative'|~|   November 17 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The stereotype of the “socially liberal, fiscally conservative” student is no novelty. Many students in college ostensibly ascribe to this political stance. Plus, this stereotype fits with the stereotype of the affluent student at a primarily liberal arts school popularly known as Princeton University. To a degree, this stereotype is rooted in truth. In this ever-volatile political climate, millennials are changing their views as more and more of them move toward nonconformity from their parents and an immutable two-party system that has engendered polarization and disillusionment with American government and politics. This is ultimately compelling them to turn away from explicit political parties and to adopt a propensity for looking specifically to the issues that concern them the most. They are moving more toward the center of the political spectrum, many of whom are forming a new voting bloc called the “Young Outsiders.” According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Group in 2010, there is a discernible trend among this generation of moving toward this sort of dualistic ideology. Younger people remain liberal on social issues, including but not limited to the environment and LGBTQA rights, while they remain conservative on fiscal issues, such as spending, the economy and the notion of the welfare state. But this self-identification is contradictory. This juxtaposition of social liberalism with fiscal conservatism is a glaring paradox. It is impractical and unrealistic to fully seek social liberalism — gay rights, the legalization of marijuana, a welfare state, universal healthcare — without big government, without spending, without taxes, without fiscal liberalism. On one hand, social liberalism refers to the compromise of freedom in search for social justice and greater civil liberties while, on the other hand, fiscal conservatism refers to cutting government spending and debt while pursuing small government. It is not feasible to have to seek social programs (like the Affordable Care Act), which necessitate government spending while simultaneously seeking small government with curbed powers. It turns out this centrist ideology has a name — libertarianism. And yet, many people who constitute this new bloc of voters aren’t even aware of that. The manner in which this title is used by so many today is inaccurate and misconstrued. It’s important to know what “socially liberal” and “fiscally conservative” entail. Myriads of people associate social liberalism merely with “letting gays marry” and fiscal conservatism with “lowering taxes for the rich.” However, these two ideologies connote more than that. Social liberalism is the belief that champions the alleviation of poverty, the expansion of education and universal healthcare. Fiscal conservatism is a policy that opposes deficit spending and supports the reduction of the national debt and overall deregulation of the economy. Just like many who identify as liberals, conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, many who identify as socially liberal but fiscally conservative don’t fully understand — or even know — what they are supporting. Perhaps if more people who identify this way actually knew what such a stance meant, they wouldn’t actually ascribe to such a title in the first place. Nevertheless, this title has evolved into a new fad across college campuses — duly noted, an even more conspicuous trend at Princeton – and it’s easy to see why. There is a particular allure to it. As a young constituent in the United States today, it is more “attractive” to dissociate oneself with the stigmas attributed to both political parties and ascribe to this political affiliation. It presents a seemingly centrist ideology, which allows voters not to have to fully conform to either party’s platform. It’s even more attractive as a pretense for the incognizant and/or apathetic college voter. It’s never been easier to elude censure as the uneducated, indifferent kid of voting age than by embracing the mob mentality behind this title. But this self-identification is irksome. As much as I share in my generation’s disgruntlement with a strictly two-party system, which impels people to conform to the party’s views or risk not having their voices heard, subscribing to the “socially liberal but fiscally conservative” stance doesn’t exactly ameliorate the current climate. Don’t conform to a party’s platform out of a perceived necessity. Formulate your own opinions and views on individual issues based on your own convictions. Do research on the issues and take an active civic and political role. But don’t heedlessly attribute this paradoxical, misguided title to yourself, particularly if you don’t even know what this title specifically refers to.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

73369|~|Study abroad chronicles: When teachers strike |~|   November 17 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The lack of activism on campus is a serious discussion, one which columnists have written about and students have commented on in casual conversation. I, too, have wondered why this might be. This article will focus on an alternative. Here at The School of Oriental and African Studies, the professors parallel, if not exceed, the level of activism of the student body. Professors here can be seen alongside students at various protests — from raising the minimum wage in London to demanding the release of a former SOAS student from an Iranian prison. The most radical activism I’ve yet seen, though, would be absolutely unheard of at the University: professors boycotting a national policy by refusing to grade examinations and papers. A professor of mine walked into class on Wednesday and explained his participation in the “Marking Boycott.” Professors all throughout London and even the entire United Kingdom, are refusing to give comments or grades on assignments as a means of protesting a devastating cut to their pension plans. Universities UK, the British universities’ employers’ body, has recently announced a cut in pensions payable to staff between 11-27% (a cut of between £3,000 and £12,000 per year). As a result, the Universities and Colleges Union has pledged a boycott after a vote that showed that 78% of the members of the union (the biggest union for staff in higher education in the United Kingdom) were willing to strike against this new policy. Other universities have challenged other aspects of the pension issue through various other boycotts, including University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, the University of Essex and the University of Warwick. As a study abroad student, I won’t be treated any differently from local students — my professors have told me they are all dedicated to the boycott and will gladly meet with me to discuss my work but will not offer any formal comments or grades for anything until the boycott is over. This is inspiring in a few ways. Firstly, I admire my professors here for standing up for what they believe in, and especially in such a visible way. It’s exciting to know that they are part of a boycott they see as important, and most of the student body is very supportive of their professors by protesting outside the school, signing and circulating a petition to the SOAS management and sending supportive messages. Some professors participated in a “Teach-Out,” in which they taught classes outside to represent the importance of teaching despite the constrictive policies a university might impose. Secondly, I enjoy the sense of liberation that comes from a learning experience without grades. Inspired by Damaris Miller ’15 who asked her professors to not show her her grades, and articulated her experience in this column, I posit that removing grades actually increases a motivation and love for learning we so often forget. Whether forcefully, due to a marking boycott, or voluntarily, due to self-motivation, it has been rewarding to rediscover learning for the sake of it over the perceived satisfaction grades can bring. The University is not an icon in terms of activism, and I always believe it’s up to students to spark change on campus. It’s up to us to change that stereotype. However, it’s worth thinking that there are places where students and staff can join together in speaking up for what they believe in. Who knows? Maybe inviting your professor to participate in a protest for something you both care about will double the impact. Marking Boycott.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

73161|~|Editorial: Create a First Generation Center |~|   November 16 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Over the last several decades, Princeton has become a more diverse place, matriculating a student body that includes women, students from diverse cultural backgrounds and students with a wide array of socioeconomic experiences. As Princeton has diversified its student body, it has made steps to become more inclusive. The University strives to be a welcoming community for all students and to provide all students with the resources that will help them succeed, regardless of their background, interests and needs. To this end, several centers that provide resources to specific groups of students have been created, including the Women’s Center, the International Center and, most recently, the LGBT Center. However, one growing voice in the student body has not been represented: first-generation college students. The Editorial Board believes more could be done to support first-generation students on campus and advocates for the creation of a First Generation Center. Last spring, 13.8 percent of students offered admission to the University would be the first in their families to attend college. It is a testament to the efforts of our Offices of Admission and Financial Aid that more students from first-generation and low-income backgrounds have the opportunity to attend Princeton. However, this is not enough. First-generation students often face unique challenges when arriving at college. Beyond this, unlike many of their peers, they may not have the same access to advice and support from their families, simply because their parents cannot relate to their college experience. This can put first-generation students at a disadvantage in making important decisions such as selecting courses, searching for summer internships and seeking post-graduation opportunities. Creating a center for first-generation students would allow the University to organize many pertinent resources in one easily accessible location. The Center would provide opportunities for students to meet and share their experiences with other students from similar backgrounds, providing a support network for their time at and after Princeton. It would also provide resources and advising that would help first-generation students. This could include academic support and advising as well as assistance in searches for jobs and internships, with which many students receive informal help from their parents and families. The Board believes that the ideal location for the center would be Frist Campus Center — the location of the Women’s Center and the LGBT Center. Being in such a neutral and central location, helps to eliminate concerns that such a center would have the isolating effect of the old “Third World Center.” Because students go to Frist frequently, they would have exposure and easy access to the Center. Creating a center would also bring more awareness to the challenges faced by first-generation students. A center would help increase the dialogue surrounding class and socioeconomic background on campus. In addition, it would bring more understanding of the issue to campus leaders such as residential college advisers. During training, RCAs listen to presentations from various groups and centers on campus, including the Fields Center, the Women’s Center and the LGBT Center. Each group explains their mission and the resources they can provide to students. If there was a centralized resource for first-generation students, RCAs could learn more about the challenges that first-generation students face, how to support them and what resources are available to them. Princeton is no longer the homogeneous community it was only decades ago. While the University has played a commendable role in making that possible, it is important that the University uses its resources to support the needs of all members of a diverse student body. Creating a First Generation Center for students who are the first in their family to attend college or are from low-income backgrounds is an important step toward a more inclusive and supportive Princeton.

73152|~|Handing down our crowns |~|   November 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Yesenia Arroyo  In a recent opinion article titled “Why working on Wall Street hurts the economy,” Coy Ozias presents an economic argument that suggests pursuing a high-paying job after graduation will increase the income gap in America and hurt the middle class. Ozias’ argument is limited because it does not take into account a perspective that is so often overlooked on this campus: that of the lower-income, first-generation minority student. I speak for students who understand they do not have the luxury to pursue only their personal fulfillment. I speak for the students who know that their lives, their Princeton journeys and their professional careers are not solely about themselves and never have been. My grandmother was illiterate. She signed her welfare checks with Xs and would take my 9-year-old mother with her to the welfare office to translate her Spanish into English. My grandmother and many of my Puerto Rican ancestors struggled because that was the only life available to them. Though I have never met my grandmother, I feel that her struggles are a part of me. My ancestors were hated for the color of their skin, scorned for being uneducated, judged for having too many children and for staying in and perpetuating social and economic situations they were incapable of escaping. Two short generations after my grandmother’s time, I walk through the campus of Princeton University. I am the first generation in my family to go to college. On my shoulders I carry the weight of my race, my gender, my low-income status, everything that has ever signaled to me that I should not and could not be a Princeton student. I have a responsibility to all those who have sacrificed so that I could be here to do something substantial with this opportunity. I am here for my father, who spent his entire life working as a New York City construction worker, who is treated as inferior and looked down upon despite the fact that he is one of the most hard-working and honorable people I know. One of my greatest aspirations is to be able to repay my parents for all of their hard work. I dream of the day I can tell them, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you.” My responsibility to give back is not limited to my parents, but also extends to those who do not have the privileges that I have. Economic stability is an important part of why I am here because I know that money opens doors. It provides access to opportunities that are out of the reach of many in my Bronx community. My hope is that, through my success, I can make the road easier for others like me. Students who aspire to high-paying jobs should not be demonized. The desire for economic stability or advancement is a reasonable motivation for any Princeton student. Instead of deterring students from joining the ranks of the 1 percent, Princeton should instill a sense of social responsibility in each and every student so that once we are in positions of power, we will feel compelled to give back to communities and people who may not have had the opportunities and resources we have been given. Perhaps those who say money doesn’t matter are not motivated by the psychological bruise left by the instability of poverty. Perhaps they do not know the limitations lack of money can have on a life, on whole generations of people, on whole races. I have been given an opportunity to advance my family’s social and economic status, and I will take it. I know there are other students on this campus who are driven by the responsibility they owe to those who have paved the way for them. I also know that I am not the only student on this campus who understands deeply what James Baldwin meant when he said our crowns have already been bought and paid for. Let us extend Baldwin’s call to wear our crowns and work diligently so that we may pay for the crown of another.|~|Yesenia Arroyo is a classics major from Bronx, N.Y.

73184|~|Melting the polarizing ice caps on climate change|~|   November 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Cameron Langford|~|None|~|Two weeks ago, Republicans took back the Senate and promised a wave of conservative reforms regarding issues like healthcare (shrink it), reproductive rights (limit abortion but provide over-the-counter birth control, maybe) and immigration (bolster border security). But they were notably silent on one issue: climate change, about which several Republicans merely shrugged, “I’m not a scientist.” That much is obvious. But that doesn’t mean Republican politicians can’t ever make policy decisions that require some understanding of science, particularly when the stakes are as high as they are with climate change. Science is inseparable from our daily lives. As laypeople, you and I must make scientific decisions despite imperfect knowledge all the time. When we elect to undergo surgery, when we vaccinate our kids, even when we decide to eat less meat, dairy or soy for health reasons — all are decisions we make based on the expert testimony of doctors and other scientists. In policymaking, science plays an even bigger role. Making national decisions often requires some amount of technical understanding, without which there is no way of determining the best course of action. As Republican energy lobbyist Michael McKenna put it, “Most politicians aren’t scientists, but they vote on science policy. They have opinions on Ebola, but they’re not epidemiologists. They shape highway and infrastructure laws, but they’re not engineers.”  So why is it climate change that shuts down the conversation? When Republicans or any other politicians say they are not scientists to brush off the climate change conversation, what they mean is that they don’t want to talk about it. But when an issue is time sensitive, as is the case with climate change, inaction is decisive. Whether motivated by laziness, fear of science, or simple ignorance, such inaction is impermissible for a politician on either side of the aisle. Not all science is conclusive, but the evidence on climate change is pretty clear. Both federal and international groups of scientists have compiled reports just this year on the growing threat climate change poses to our planet and our way of life. The effects of human activity on our planet are not only likely to have an impact on the future; increasingly extreme temperatures, water scarcity and torrential rains are already affecting American agriculture, economy and daily life today. And constituents agree: Over half of Americans think human activities are to blame for climate change, according to a March Gallup poll. Scientists, to their credit, are trying to make their field more accessible to the average person. Just take a look at the National Climate Assessment’s easy-to-navigate website, Neil deGrasse Tyson’s average-Joe-oriented show “Cosmos” or even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s handy “Summary for Policymakers.” Policymakers should use these tools, as well as their unique access to scientists as Washington’s elite, to educate themselves. This doesn’t mean they necessarily need to passively receive their information from scientists. But the benefit of user-friendly tools like those mentioned is that they create an opportunity for skeptics like Senator James Inhofoe (R-OK), author of “The Greatest Hoax,” to insert themselves into the debate around climate change, rather than to simply insulate themselves from it.  If Republicans are going to deny climate change, they should do it upfront and based on reasoned evidence rather than hiding behind the excuse that they aren’t qualified to talk science. Of course, in Congress, there’s not always time to do one’s homework. That’s why scientists are especially important in policymaking. This is the notion of legitimate authority advanced by legal philosopher Joseph Raz: Appealing to authority makes sense when it allows us to better act in our own self-interest — to make better decisions — than if we went at it alone. Climate change, with its often-impenetrable models and technical jargon, seems the perfect example of a case where we might be better off taking the scientists’ word for it. Still, there could be a danger in blindly accepting science as if it were a testament of truth handed down from the research gods. Scientists have their own biases and a desire for self-preservation, which means ensuring a steady flow of government funding for the sciences. That need for government funding is perhaps one reason why Republicans are so reluctant to confront the issue. Moreover, scientific truth is different than capital-T Truth; like surgery, it is always marked by an amount of uncertainty, and that gray area is where things get tricky. Climate change is no different. We don’t know exactly what will happen when global temperatures and sea levels rise. We can’t predict the future down to which real estate will go from waterfront to underwater, which animals will go extinct or which crops will be decimated. But we can get pretty close to the answer, and as policymakers now at Congress’s helm, Republicans ought now to take a look — or to at least phone a scientist.|~|Cameron Langford is a politics major from Davidson, N.C.

72998|~|Privacy should be a right |~|   November 13 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Logan Sander|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The number of bottles grew over time — first shampoo and conditioner, then hair gel. “This guy must really love his hair,” my friend told me after finding such hair products crowding the men’s bathroom on multiple occasions. A few days later, he walked in to find a girl, fresh from the shower — naked — in front of a mirror lined with those very same products. Whether the showers in the women’s bathroom’s were already occupied or were just less clean we will never know — there are a multitude of reasons why girls use the guys’ bathrooms. Easy access without a bathroom code makes it quite convenient for both guys and girls. Not having a code for the men’s bathroom, however, is a double standard. The codes for the women’s bathrooms were put in place in the 1970s after undergraduate women on campus lobbied for their installment for their own safety and privacy (females were still largely outnumbered by males on campus, as this was only a few years after the University became co-ed). Even now, with a nearly equal divide between male and female undergraduates on campus, women still have this privacy — and so should men. Both men and women deserve to feel safe and comfortable in their respective bathrooms; all bathrooms should have codes in order to better protect students’ privacy. I have actually talked to a number of guys who say they wouldn’t want a bathroom code (apparently, remembering and punching in four digits is quite difficult), but that doesn’t change the fact that any guy who does care about his privacy in the bathroom has a right to it. By labeling men’s and women’s bathrooms as such, we have an agreement: Girls will use the women’s bathrooms, and guys will use the men’s bathrooms. Even if only one guy feels better knowing that girls will not be in the bathroom when he walks out of the shower, he should be able to have that safety just as much as girls should. The right to privacy, especially in the bathrooms, should always take precedence over convenience, and we cannot hold this as a double standard for guys and girls; guys deserve privacy and comfort just as much as girls do. This discrepancy in privacy also has larger implications, both symbolic and practical. Why is it OK for a girl to be in a men’s bathroom, but if a guy walked into a women’s bathroom, he would probably be met with horror and a few screams? With a bathroom code only on the women’s bathrooms, does that imply that girls are in greater need of safety from guys walking in than guys are of girls? Do guys not need a similar protection? Guys can be victims of sexual assault, too, and it’s not entirely uncommon. People of any gender can be harassed or violated. Mitchell Hammer, in his column from spring 2014, discusses this issue in depth. The discrepancy in bathroom codes leads to unfair ideas about sexual assault and denies men the right to feel safe in their own bathrooms. Having a code for all bathrooms provides more security that the only people going into the bathrooms are ones who should be, whether they are people of your gender or just, in general, people within the University community who have explicitly been given the bathroom code. It is worth noting, as well, that having bathroom codes does not restrict those who are non-gender conforming, as there are also gender-neutral bathrooms and numerous single-stall bathrooms located all throughout campus. Similarly, the gender-neutral bathrooms should also have codes; though people of any gender can use them, having a code helps to ensure that the people using the bathroom are ones who should be. This gives all people maximum safety and peace of mind as well as the opportunity to make their own decisions about where they feel most comfortable. Many would argue that it is not exactly difficult to get ahold of the bathroom codes anywhere, which is often true. Having codes for all bathrooms, however, provides a peace of mind that whoever is entering the bathroom was given the code, hopefully in good faith, and that they are using it properly. Having bathroom codes for all bathrooms is only fair; it allows every person to feel comfortable, regardless of gender. It is unfair that guys have to deal with girls using their bathrooms, whether they generally don’t mind or they do. Every person should have equal opportunities for privacy and comfort, and that includes not accidentally walking in on a girl’s after-shower rituals in the men’s bathroom.|~|Logan Sander is a freshman from Sylvania, Ohio.

73007|~|Editorial: Implement broader placement testing |~|   November 13 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Over the past few weeks, members of the freshman class experienced their first set of midterm exams. As a rite of passage in the Princeton experience, freshmen are often disappointed with their first set of midterm grades. This disappointment is perhaps most palpable for students aiming to concentrate in engineering or the hard sciences, who are compelled to take physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science courses as prerequisites. While the challenge that some students taking these courses inevitably face is appropriate, other students may find themselves in courses for which they do not have the proper prior preparation. Though, in some cases, students may be able to alter their schedules by dropping to a lower level of the same class, some students have no other option besides remaining in their sections. The Board believes that this problem could be solved with broader placement testing as well as advising that takes into account the results of this testing. Currently, recommendations for placement into engineering and hard sciences courses are based almost solely on standardized test scores. This is problematic for several reasons. First, standardized test scores often reflect mastery of topics within a subject only covered in that exam. Undergraduate courses at the University may cover different topics within a subject, and allowing incoming students to take higher-level courses on the basis of test scores could force students to learn background material taught in Princeton introductory courses while learning more difficult material. Further, since high school courses cover subjects with different levels of rigor, even high standardized test scores reflect different levels of mastery. Finally, since students take advanced high school courses at different times throughout their high school careers, students may not remember the background material needed for upper-level classes. Department-developed placement exams could more accurately give students the information they need to plan an appropriately challenging freshman fall. Placement tests for technical classes could improve advising for incoming students. First, faculty advisers could better advise students on the courses they need to take to fulfill requirements and prerequisites. Course placements would give students a better idea of how challenging courses will be, allowing advisers to more accurately suggest a course schedule that strikes an appropriate balance between academic and non-academic life during freshman fall. While the Board understands that freshman fall is a time of self-discovery, we believe that improving the advising process could give students more guidance on their strengths and weaknesses, improving the freshman fall experience. Departments could adapt existing infrastructure to administer placement tests. These tests could be administered on Blackboard before students arrive on campus as well as on campus before classes begin, just as language placement tests are. While placement tests do exist within departments, these are often used either when students want to move past introductory courses entirely (as in the case of physics) or for students who either did not take the appropriate standardized tests (as in the case of chemistry). Placement testing in spite of Advanced Placement scores could more accurately place all students, allowing for differentiation among students who received the same score. While the logistics of placement testing would be difficult, given that test scores currently fulfill prerequisites for several courses and departments, the effort is an appropriate sacrifice to ensure that students’ freshman years do not result in large setbacks for their grades, morale or course progression. Testing will help ensure that students’ freshman year courses appropriately reflect their coursework prior to coming to the University.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The Board answers only to its chair, the opinion editor and the editor-in-chief. 
72801|~|Pro-Israel; Anti-Occupation|~|   November 12 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By The Board of J Street U Princeton In recent weeks, the controversial tactic of boycott, divestment, and sanctions has been thrust into the center of our community’s conversation on Israel and Palestine. A faculty-driven petition calling for the University to divest from companies directly profiting from Israel’s occupation of the West Bank has surfaced. Even before the full text of this BDS petition was released, student leaders of Princeton’s Center for Jewish Life (CJL) began circulating a counter-petition, categorizing the movement as aiming to “demonize or assign absolute blame” to Israel. The statements above — and the order in which they were put out — strangled an honest conversation about the underlying challenges facing Israel and Palestine. Ultimately, they have put a false choice in front of students: you can either choose BDS, or you can choose silence on the occupation. As J Street U, we believe there’s a better way. J Street U Princeton is an affiliate student group of the CJL, and we oppose the BDS movement. We are also opposed to the occupation and settlements. And we believe that if the CJL is willing to take a political stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by condemning BDS, it should denounce, with equal force, Israeli policies that perpetuate conflict and injustice. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to vastly expand the illegal settlement enterprise in the occupied West Bank, despite the opposition by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union. According to the UN, Israeli settlements have doubled in the last four years alone, including 14,000 settlement homes approved during the American-led peace negotiations last year. These settlements are not only illegal under international law but are immoral and wholly antithetical to Israel’s stated desire to build peace with the Palestinian people. By entrenching the occupation further, a two-state solution, which is in Israel’s interest, becomes further and further away. As violence returns to the region in the form of terror attacks on Israeli civilians, it is all the more important to redouble our efforts toward peace. And as individuals who are deeply concerned for Israel’s Jewish, democratic future, we see it as our duty to speak out about this policy. The CJL should as well. The CJL’s Israel Policy Statement declares its commitment to Israel as a “Jewish and democratic state.” The settlement institution directly undermines and will certainly preclude such a future for the State of Israel. Continued settlement expansion in the West Bank inevitably provides Israel with two choices: either allow Palestinians living in areas occupied by Israel the same democratic rights afforded by settlers, at the risk of eroding its Jewish character; or, maintain the status quo, whereby only Jewish residents of the West Bank have legal and political rights, a reality that is inherently undemocratic. Some who oppose the divestment advocated by the faculty’s petition argue that the BDS movement aims to single out Israel as if it were able to change its own path unilaterally and without regard to external circumstances. In a sense, this argument is justifiable: A mutually agreed-upon solution to the conflict remains the best possible outcome for the region, and international ostracism of Israel is not conducive to that goal. However, we must also acknowledge Israel’s power and responsibility in ending the occupation itself. In kowtowing to the wishes of a powerful pro-settlement right wing, the Israeli government is acting like nothing if not a “unilateral actor,” choosing its path without heed of risks. Our community’s deep ties to Israel are a great resource to the anti-occupation movement, and our values command us to use those ties to better the situation. The CJL is a place special to hundreds of Princetonians, and a critical voice in our campus dialogue on Israel and Palestine. Thus, it is all the more important that the CJL leads our community to fight against the occupation – not just disparage those with whom it disagrees. J Street U will continue to seek a political solution to the conflict. We challenge the rest of the CJL to join us.|~|Natasha Madorsky ’17 and Justin Vogel ’17 are the presidents of J Street U Princeton, and can be reached at natasham@princeton.edu and jhvogel@princeton.edu.

72772|~|Improving residential college Broadway trips|~|   November 12 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|I am the reason my friend almost did not get to see “The Lion King” on Broadway last night. She had joined the line at the Whitman College Office an hour early; I joined 10 minutes after her. We were among the first 25 to stake a claim in line, and the office had 45 tickets to sell. We were set. Five minutes before the office opened, we weren’t quite set anymore. Inexplicably, we had moved back several places in line. A good handful of those ahead of us had not been there waiting at any point in the last hour. Days later, I voiced concern to a member of the office staff, who assured me that no cutting had taken place: These students were simply handing their proxes to friends who had held their place in line, and because each student is allowed to buy one ticket for a friend, everyone had played by the rules. I might grant my peers this favorable judgment, except that I know it’s not true. I saw a friend from my zee group let another friend join her, and the pair walked away not with two tickets but with three. Surely we all realize that cutting to the front like this will get us a ticket only at the expense of someone else who has been waiting longer. Why good people brazenly rob other students of tickets, I cannot say. But I can say that I feel like a robber, too. Nervous that tickets would run out, I passed my prox up the line to a roommate who had arrived earlier. What I did was okay, technically — the college office allowed my roommate to buy two tickets. I didn’t give it a second thought until I texted my friend who had joined line ten minutes sooner. When I asked if she had gotten a ticket, the answer came with four wailing emoji. She told me she was the first person turned away. Had I stayed in line behind her, I would not have gotten a ticket — but she would have. Although my sleight of prox might have complied with rules, it was unfair to my friend. The staff member with whom I spoke told me that, in light of this logistic fiasco, Whitman will distribute tickets via a lottery system in the future. Winners’ tickets will be withheld until they board the bus, in order to prevent reselling. The office’s quick response delights me, and I really do believe that a lottery system will be better (as the Editorial Board recently suggested). Still, scores of students who want to go will be denied. The mission of the residential colleges’ Broadway trips is to provide students with the opportunity to experience world-class art and turning away interested students is fundamentally at odds with that mission. I think there’s an easy solution to this, which is to encourage students to buy their own tickets. Residential colleges currently pay around $120 per seat after a paltry group discount is applied; however, student tickets to “The Phantom of the Opera” and other big-name Broadway shows can be had for $34 online. They’re in the rear mezzanine, sure, but I’d rather see two shows from there than see only one show from the orchestra. Students who independently buy tickets should be allowed to ride on the college trip bus, and colleges should explore their options further to see if they can buy student-rate tickets themselves. If so, they will be able to afford two or three times as many tickets; then, students won’t be left out anymore. This story has a happy ending. My friend ultimately snagged a ticket when someone sold theirs back to the office, so she was, in fact, present for “The Lion King.” Plus, the speedy action taken by the Whitman College Office in reforming ticket distribution shows they are able and willing to respond to students’ concerns. They are a heartwarming example for the rest of the University to follow when distributing high-demand tickets. Hopefully, they continue to lead by exploring options to purchase higher quantities of heavily discounted tickets. Until broader reform takes place, I implore you: Don’t cut in line. If it’s benefiting you, it’s hurting someone else.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn. He can be reached at newby@princeton.edu. 
72797|~|The trust deficit|~|   November 12 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Ask a room full of people what they think when they hear the word “deficit” and the words “economy,” “government spending” or “taxes” may quickly come to mind. In a post-recession world, the phrase “deficit crisis” has become synonymous with government dysfunction, even used as a rallying call to criticize government largesse. However, Washington, D.C., may not be the only source of concern. Last week, Harvard faced public scrutiny when it was revealed that school administrators secretly photographed students without their permission. In a study to monitor attendance, administrators had installed cameras in several lecture halls, without informing either the professors or students. The study caused anuproar on campus, sparking a debate over the potential violation of student privacy. Yet, in doing so, the controversy also struck at the heart of a more fundamental issue: the trust deficit. Trust is an essential part of society. From the emotional support of friendship to the enhanced bargaining power of collective unions, trust allows us to build relationships to accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible to do on our own. Trust even has an economic rationale. When we can trust others, fewer resources need to be dedicated to monitor compliance, reducing transaction costs and making exchanges more frequent and fluid. Trust truly benefits everyone. However, throughout our lives, our generation has grown to be more and more pessimistic about many sources of authority, whether they are political, educational or social. As the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche succinctly put it, “I’m not upset that you lied to me, I’m upset that from now on I can’t believe you.” While trust opens many doors, it takes little to lock them forever. Trust is built upon one’s ability to rely on another, violating that trust inherently impedes that ability, poisoning the well. Unlike a broken object, trust is not something that can be repaired or replaced. But trust is not always black and white. There is no rulebook dictating what is and isn’t trustworthy (although it’s probably not a good sign if you’re trying to find one). It may not always be clear to both sides that trust has been broken. However, rules are different. We are pretty good at following them to a tee and knowing when they are and aren’t broken. After all, in a technical sense, Harvard committed no wrong. They clearly checked to see no rules were broken in their process of monitoring, even having the school’s institutional board approve the study. The University’s intentions, albeit misplaced, were clearly not malicious. But that’s the problem. Harvard never broke any rules, yet this abuse in trust still occurred. And therein lies the rub. In the past decade our fundamental relationships with major institutions and sources of authority in our lives have slowly been whittled away. From governmental abuse through the National Security Agency program, to Facebook’s subliminal psychological study, no rules were ever broken. It may be naïve and idealistic to hope that no institution would ever abuse our trust, but schools, out of all institutions, have a primary obligation to protect that trust-based relationship. Schools have a premier role in our society. Through education, we are able to gain the knowledge and skills to be productive members of society. This relationship is entirely built upon trust, both in the practical sense of being able to rely on the administration for any problems that may arise and on a more theoretical level of being able to trust someone else to instill us with the right lessons and information. If we are not able to trust those in charge of educating us, it defeats the purpose of education entirely. Granted, there is an argument to be made that trust, in the case of Harvard, was violated for a greater good. After all, the data gathered would allow professors to learn more about how to raise or maintain attendance, allowing more students to be able to benefit from the experience of learning from top-quality professors. However, this short-term positive goal benefits Harvard only through the sacrifice of a longer-term relationship. It may be this deep-rooted mistrust that has led to the deep apathy that many in our generation feel today towards most sources of authority. The implications of this are vast. If we don’t care about our education, our politicians or our society as a whole because we do not have faith in those in charge to change it, then we only allow these things to worsen and for them to further abuse our trust. I’m not advocating for some strict authoritarian law to mandate only trust-preserving practices in order to fix this lack of trust. (Ironically, forcing someone to be “trustworthy” would probably prevent you from trusting them to begin with.) However, I think that leaders, across all spectra and areas, must realize that their actions have consequences. Even if an action isn’t illegal or against the rules, it can still break trust. Acknowledging this would go a long way to resolving the trust deficit.|~|Ben Dinovelli is a Wilson School major from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu. 
72761|~|An open letter from Jewish students to the CJL community and Hillel International|~|   November 12 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|We, the undersigned, are Jewish students on this campus who were troubled, most recently, by Executive Director of the Center for Jewish Life Rabbi Julie Roth’s letter, emailed to all students affiliated with the CJL, that laid out the CJL’s institutional response to a faculty petition calling for the University to “divest from all companies that contribute to or profit from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank until the State of Israel complies with UN Resolution 242, ends its military occupation of the West Bank and lifts its siege of Gaza.” The letter states that the CJL is “taking the best, positive strategic approach to defeat this action,” including a direct link to a counter-petition open to all members of the University community—as though taking such action is a foregone conclusion for our community. Last week’s letter is emblematic of the larger bind into which Hillel International forces the CJL and our community. Hillel International has specific Standards of Partnership that dictate a single-line stance on Israel, and while we understand that the CJL must conform to those standards, we are disappointed by the decision to take a political stance on the ithis issue on behalf of the entire community. Doing so excludes the many Jews who do not share these views. Jews on college campuses have widely divergent views—we need to make our Hillel — and every Hillel — an open Hillel to make room for these views. There is no consensus within the American Jewish community on the issue of West Bank settlements. According to a recent Pew survey, 44 percent of American Jews say ongoing settlement construction “hurts Israel’s security.” At the University, many Jewish students share this view. We regret that Jewish students who support divestment from companies that profit from or enable Israel’s continued settlement construction and human rights abuses in the West Bank are outside the bounds of what Hillel International considers to be acceptable opinions. Our branch of Hillel professes “a commitment to a pluralistic Jewish community.” It cannot uphold that important commitment properly while ascribing one view to the entire community or equating our community’s interests with a single political stance. Though we do not here express support for or opposition to divestment, we believe it is important to clarify the meaning and language of the faculty petition, which the CJL has misconstrued. The petition does not target exclusively Israeli companies, nor does it call for a boycott of Israel; rather, it specifically refers to all companies that profit from or contribute to continuing settlement construction and human rights abuses in the West Bank. This is not an extreme position. Many liberal Zionists, including political expert Peter Beinart, have come out in favor of a limited boycott, which according to a recent J Street poll is also supported by 49 percent of American Jews under 30, including some of the signatories of this letter. (J Street is also a group affiliated with our Hillel and many other schools’ Hillel chapters.) It must not be out of bounds for Jews at the University’s Hillel, or any Hillel, to ask that Israel comply not only with statutes of international law but also with the State Department’s position on settlements, which reads: “The United States has a clear policy—we do not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity. We oppose any effort to legalize settlement outposts, which is unhelpful to our peace efforts.” The CJL letter articulated the need to take action to “ensure that every Jewish student at Princeton feels comfortable with his or her Jewish identity and safe to express their feelings about Israel,” implying that the faculty petition has created an unsafe environment for Jewish students. We are frustrated by the suggestion that the faculty boycott petition might somehow make some students “unsafe” without taking into account the effects Hillel International’s own stance will have on those Jewish students whose political views do not conform to Hillel’s narrow ideological boundaries. We have spoken with a number of Jewish students who decided not to sign this letter because they feared repercussions within the Jewish community. The University is a place for the free discussion of ideas; even if we disagree with those ideas, discussing them and reading about them does not make us “unsafe.” A letter sent this week by the National Lawyers Guild, the Center for Constitutional Rights and other civil liberties groups to 140 university administrators voiced concern over the use of language such as “safety” and “civility” to chill political speech on campus. “Private universities … risk undermining an environment that fosters open debate and critical thinking, ideals that most institutions of higher education profess,” the letter emphasized. Our CJL’s Israel Policy Statement reads that, “when controversy arises on campus on questions concerning Israel, the CJL will encourage a full and open discussion of the issues with all its stakeholders, including students with conflicting views.” However, by providing institutional support to oppose the faculty divestment petition, it closes the door to further communal discussion of this issue. Consequently, we are missing out on a vital opportunity for substantive debate. Debate is an integral part of the Jewish tradition. The CJL and Hillel International would best fulfill their purpose by allowing the current discussion of boycott and divestment to proceed within the University’s Jewish community without taking a side on its behalf. There is no political litmus test for being Jewish. There should be no political litmus test for being part of the Hillel community.

72547|~|Let's do long-distance|~|   November 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|“Don’t bother befriending any visiting students,” says Creative Director and Deputy Arts & Lit Editor of The Oxford Student, Natalie Harney. “Yes, they’re unbelievably exotic, but too late will you realize that they aren’t in it for the long haul, and before you know it, they’ll have abandoned you for their ‘real’ friends back home.” Ever since this statement was published in an OxStu article on Oct. 17, Harney has received substantial backlash for advising matriculating students to avoid associating with visiting students. Harney thereby insinuated not only that friendships with exchange students are temporary but also that they are, frankly, shallow. It’s hard to figure out who the victims would be, considering both visiting students and matriculating students would suffer from an attitude that basically shuns a valuable minority of a college’s student body. If we consider the premise of weighing the pros and cons of a relationship, Harney’s statement implies that we’re judging and, even more so, setting a value on a group of students before we’ve had the opportunity to get to know them. To me, this seems like outright discrimination. This outlook reinforces the flawed approach of making friends in college with the sole motive of making connections. While college is one of the first entry points at which young adults can independently network, this doesn’t mean that every interaction you have should be quantified by its potential return. Even if we do consider that many of the relationships students make in college are connections, then wouldn’t it be in their best interests to broaden these horizons, regardless of how they do this? From Harney’s perspective, we’re almost assuming that our careers are limited to the opportunities and people who are available to us in our immediate geographical vicinity in our four years as undergraduates. As students with majors sweeping from global health to international relations to politics and economics, shouldn’t we make an effort to learn more about different societies from the very people who are experiencing them firsthand, rather than only having an understanding based on class readings from humanities textbooks? And this doesn’t just apply to students in the social sciences. Even majors that don’t explicitly advertise international collaboration, like science, technology, engineering and mathematics, they inevitably demand that their professionals have an ability to network internationally and have an understanding of the sociological and historical factors that impact their work. Furthermore, I personally resent the word “exotic” in characterizing a student’s value in any relationship. I can almost guarantee that no admission or study abroad committee accepts students to their university based on the criteria of “exoticism” — a word that in and of itself reduces the personal worth and academic merit of an entire demographic of students to an inappropriate and undeserved stereotype. In fact, it’s really not even appropriate to say that the main value of befriending international and visiting students is that they can bring their individual cultures and stories to the table. After all, this inconsiderate expectation would basically demand that they limit themselves to talking about their countries without being acknowledged as an intellectual being beyond this contribution. Most of all, Harney’s quote highlights the temporality of the relationship as her reasoning for why it’s not worth it to befriend international students. This is problematic on many levels — the first being that compared to the grand scheme of our careers and our lives, most of our college interactions can be seen as temporary. However, this hasn’t meant that students have just stopped trying to bond and network with even the matriculating students. Her concern with the potential impermanence of friendships with visiting students puts an unreasonable pressure on a relationship that can actually endure if it is not approached with this kind of skepticism and reluctance. After all, just because we’ve gone away to college, doesn’t mean that we’ve stopped talking to our friends from high school — it only means that we have to use different means to continue the communication and that we have someone to visit if we ever travel. The opportunity to meet people and form a different kind of relationship is often a major reason why international and visiting students choose to study abroad in the first place, which means that it’s even more necessary that we welcome them rather than shun them based on the fact that they’ll reliably leave at the end of their program — lest they leave our institution regretting the experience. While Harney’s statement might have been a reflection of a bad experience or even a statement regarding the difficulties of enduring and maintaining a long-distance friendship, I certainly hope that this isn’t an outlook that the majority of students have toward international and visiting students. After all, should we ever choose to participate in study abroad — whether it last for a semester or a couple of years — wouldn’t we want to be welcomed into an environment that treats us as assets both personally and academically, rather than potential heartbreaks? After my four years at the University, I certainly hope that the last advice I can give isn’t for students to keep their distance from visiting students but to appreciate these students’ presences while they’re here and to sustain the relationships once the visiting students leave.|~| Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major from Irvine, Calif.

72657|~|Content over professor|~|   November 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Matthew Choi Taitano|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“That sounds like an interesting course, but who teaches it?” When I was signing up for classes at the beginning of the semester, I asked upperclassmen for recommendations. All of them, I noticed, recommended courses to me based on the professors rather than the courses themselves. One class in particular fell in line with many of my interests, but when the upperclassmen saw who was teaching the class, they said, “Oh, I wouldn’t take it. I heard bad things about the professor.” At first, I thought to myself that I would take the course anyway because it matched my interests. However, when the time came for my academic advising meeting, I ended up choosing a course that did not sound as interesting as the other, but that was taught by a professor who received good reviews on easyPCE, an evaluation website for University courses. Now that I am halfway through the semester, I have mixed feelings about the decision I made. On the one hand, I really enjoy my professor’s teaching style, but on the other hand, I find myself struggling with every paper since I don’t find the topics interesting. This sometimes makes me wonder what I would be going through had I chosen the course in which I initially wanted to enroll. Would it be more interesting? Even though the professor did not have as good of a reputation as my current one does, would the topics discussed make the class more bearable? The thought of having a professor who might not teach as well or who might be a harsh grader scares many students at the University from taking courses they find genuinely interesting. This is understandable, since taking a class in which the professor is unenthused or disorganized may seem useless. However, the content of such a class is placed at jeopardy, as students go through course listings, see one they think will stimulate their curiosity, but reject all thought of taking it once they see the name of the instructor. This fear of bad professors instills a fear of academic exploration in students. As freshmen, my classmates and I do not know the reputations of many professors, which forces us to take courses based on subject matter. A friend taking a course that interested her despite the professor’s reputation ended up enjoying the course purely because of the content. Her passion for the subject transcended the poor reviews the professor received; she simply pushed herself to work harder in the class, which she did not mind because what she was learning was pertinent to her. This is the attitude we need to take, as Princeton students. Although it is important to ensure that a professor’s teaching style matches our learning capabilities, it is also important to take classes whose content calls out to us. A senior with whom I recently spoke brought up an important point to factor into our decision-making process when it comes to selecting courses. “The content is much more important if you intend to put a fair amount of work into a class. Just thinking about it from a time perspective, you’ll be in lecture for two hours a week for most classes, but you’ll be dealing with the subject material for much longer in the form of readings, problems sets, essays, etc. Good professors make sitting in lecture a little nicer, but I’d take an interesting course with a bad professor over an uninteresting course with a great professor any day. Taking classes for content is especially important for underclassmen still trying to figure out what department major in.” This is the attitude that we must take to maximize our potential as intellectuals. We must all take advantage of the richness of the education available to us. We must not let the fear of bad professors discourage us from enrolling in courses that entice our intellectual cravings.|~|Matthew Choi Taitano is a freshman from Yigo, Guam.

72532|~|Offer introductory language courses year-round|~|   November 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|One of the best parts of the University’s undergrad curriculum is the freedom to explore during your first two years (and to some degree, even after you’ve selected a major). We don’t have standard general education courses that every single freshman or sophomore has to take, like at Columbia. While writing seminar is required, the topics differ dramatically from class to class, and students are given the ability to rank their preferences, and even the distribution requirements we do have are, in my experience, extremely broad and flexible. The Admission website advertises Princeton as a place where undergraduates are “encouraged to explore the curriculum” and take classes unrelated to their prospective majors. The across-the-board high quality of the University’s departments means that it’s perfectly reasonable to come in as a math major and graduate with a comparative literature degree and expect a high-caliber experience in either department. This freedom to explore, however, is significantly curtailed by the University’s language offerings. By offering 101- and 103-level language courses only in the fall, the University has created a system in which many students ‘miss the boat’ and are unable to try a language they would be interested in. During freshman and even sophomore year, students who discover a potential interest in a language or have a desire to become proficient in it can easily be left behind just because their interests shift during the school year instead of over the summer. This problem is not self-contained, however, because many certificates in content areas (e.g., Contemporary European Politics and Society as well as East Asian Studies) have a language component/requirement as well. Other classes in these content areas can trigger an interest in pursuing the certificate, but the inflexibility of the language requisites may make it impossible for students to fulfill this interest because they simply can’t afford to wait until the next fall to start the language. For example, consider a student who — for any number of reasons or for no reason at all — decides to take an EAS class on modern Japanese politics in the fall of sophomore year. He becomes enamored by the subject and hopes to pursue an EAS certificate to further engage his interest. Now, while it’s conceivable that he could begin Japanese 101: Elementary Japanese I a few weeks into the add/drop period, in practice there is enormous incentive not to do this since being a few weeks behind in a 101 language class is far harder to catch up from than in most content classes. Therefore, whether or not the student decides to begin Japanese during or after the add/drop period, odds are in both cases he’ll instead wait until the following year. This places the student at an enormous disadvantage since he’ll have to take introductory language classes during each of his last four semesters at the University and won’t have the language ability necessary to conduct primary source research for the content classes taken for the certificate. It is unfair to this student that because of University scheduling restrictions, he is arbitrarily worse at Japanese (and therefore worse at EAS research) than other students in the certificate program and especially than he himself could have been. By allowing students to take 101- and 103-level language classes in either term, the University could allow them greater flexibility in catching up to their fellow students. Rather than waiting to begin a language until junior year, students could take 101 at the University in the spring, the equivalent of 102 over the summer and then join the ‘normal’ progression (i.e., join 105/107 depending on the language) in the fall of the following year. This would mean that by the fall of that second year, students would have taken three of the (usually) four required semesters of a language, instead of only one. The students could then continue in higher-level classes with everyone else or use their now ‘free’ course slots in their schedules to take the content classes required for that certificate or any other course that interests them. The University’s flexibility of curriculum is one of the strong points of its undergraduate program. Yet to further encourage exploration all the way through sophomore year (before majors are declared), the University would do well to offer 100-level language courses in both their traditional and ‘off’ semesters. To truly be a school where one can come in as a biology major and graduate with a degree in French (and tons of other majors and certificates that have language components) without having to change one’s mind during first semester of freshman year, introductory/100-level language courses should be offered year-round.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

72501|~|Be part of the solution |~|   November 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Sam Major  Last Tuesday, a number of Princeton faculty members ran an advertisement in The Daily Princetonian calling for the University to “divest from all companies that contribute to or profit from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and continued siege of Gaza.” Many students, however, disagree. As of today, 350 students have signed this statement. The faculty petition seems to be largely motivated by events in Israel and Gaza this summer. Before addressing the petition itself, I would first like to address this summer’s conflict. On July 8, the Israeli Defense Forces launched Operation Protective Edge in order to quell Hamas rocket fire into Israel. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, is recognized as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia and others. At the beginning of this operation, the IDF targeted Hamas terrorists firing at Israeli cities. Later, the IDF moved into Gaza to find and dismantle tunnels constructed by Hamas to reach across the border into Israel in order to terrorize, abduct and kill Israelis. During the operation, approximately 2,100 Gazans were killed. Groups differ over what percentage of those killed were civilians. Some groups based in Gaza claim that civilians comprised over 80 percent of those killed; Israel maintains that militants comprised 50 percent of those killed. The IDF sustained 66 casualties fighting in and near Gaza; seven civilians in Israel were killed as well. Some condemned Israel’s actions during this operation as “disproportionate,” a form of “collective punishment” or even genocidal. Undoubtedly, reports detailing the loss of innocent Gazans’ lives are deeply saddening. However, it must be emphasized that Israeli forces went to incredible – or, as General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated, “extraordinary” – lengths to avoid such civilian casualties. It must be emphasized that before intensifying attacks against Hamas, Israel looked to avoid escalation while Hamas rejected diplomatic cease-fire efforts. It must be emphasized that Hamas intentionally fires from and embeds its terror infrastructure within densely populated civilian areas and calls on civilians to ignore Israeli warnings and remain in the line of fire. It must be emphasized that terrorists in Gaza fired over 4,000 rockets at Israeli cities, forcing millions of Israelis into bomb shelters. It must be emphasized that the Iron Dome – the US-funded missile defense system and testament to the life-saving power of the US-Israel relationship – saved countless lives in Israel. It must be emphasized that no country would tolerate such brazen violations of its citizens’ security as Hamas‘ tunnels and incessant rocket fire. Lastly – as President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of State Hilary Rodham Clinton, the US Congress (unanimously), the EU, UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and many other world leaders have done – it must be emphasized that Israel has the right to defend itself. Furthermore, Israel has a responsibility to protect its citizens and ensure that they are not forced to live under terror. It is in this context that faculty at Princeton launched the aforementioned divestment campaign. In their call for divestment, these professors assign absolute blame for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to Israel, ignoring the daily threats to Israelis’ security and wellbeing. They ignore Hamas terrorists in the West Bank and Gaza devoted to murdering Israelis. They call for Israel to act unilaterally, without any guarantees of peace from Palestinian leadership. Furthermore, they ignore the numerous peace efforts, compromises, and proposals made by Israeli leaders throughout the history of the conflict. By assigning absolute blame to Israel, the faculty petition connects – whether directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally – to the larger boycott, divestment and sanctions movement targeting Israel. In light of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the BDS movement calls for boycotting Israeli goods, divesting from Israeli companies and companies that deal with Israel and implementing sanctions against Israel. As Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz explains, the BDS movement’s central flaw is that it hinders peace. Leaders of the BDS movement do not call for a mutual, negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Instead,of calling for two states for two peoples, living side-by-side in peace and prosperity, BDS leaders demonize Israel, ignore Palestinian shortcomings, and offer no constructive solutions to the conflict. Accordingly, divestment – and the larger BDS movement – is counter-productive to establishing a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Condemning one party while ignoring the other’s faults drives the parties further from compromise by alienating the former and emboldening the latter to maintain uncompromising positions. Moreover, condemning the party that has extended its hand in peacetime and again only makes peaceful compromise more unlikely. Instead of calling for divestment, we at the University should call for direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Peace cannot be imposed. It can only be reached through dialogue, negotiation and compromise. To be sure, fault lies on both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: whether from Israeli settlement policy, incitement to violence by Palestinian leadership or other unilateral actions. Demonizing or assigning absolute blame to either Israelis or Palestinians will only hinder diplomatic peace efforts. Princetonians have a choice. We can add to the never-ending blame game that divestment campaigns perpetuate, or we can help to bridge the divide between Israelis and Palestinians by calling for mutual peace, attainable only through negotiations pursuant to a permanent, peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I invite all Princetonians to join in signing our statement supporting mutual peace and prosperity. Be part of the solution. Sam Major is a history major from New York, NY.

72493|~|The case for divestment |~|   November 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Last Tuesday, 48 tenured Princeton professors published an open letter calling on the University to divest from companies that profit from or contribute to the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and siege on Gaza. The purpose of this piece is to open a petition supporting this call to the wider University community and to clarify the facts surrounding divestment. Both the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and siege on Gaza flagrantly violate Palestinian human rights. In Gaza, the Israeli military’s sealed borders, total control of airspace, and naval blockade — an act of war under international law — confine 1.8 million people to a massive open-air prison. Repeated Israeli military engagements in Gaza have drawn international condemnation for their disproportionate use of violence against civilians. This summer, Israeli air strikes and shelling killed at least 1,486 civilians, including 513 children, while six Israeli civilians were killed. In the West Bank, the Israeli military denies freedom of movement with checkpoints and walls. The occupation “judicial” system robs Palestinians of basic rights through mass and arbitrary incarceration, military courts with a 99.7 percent conviction rate and extrajudicial executions. In addition, the occupation inflicts a continuous campaign of violence through home demolitions and brutal crackdowns on peaceful civilian protest; on average, a Palestinian child was killed by Israeli forces every three days between 2000 and 2013. It is essential to understand that Israel benefits concretely from its military occupation of the West Bank, which extends its control over ever more water, land, and resources. There is insufficient incentive for the state or companies invested in the occupation to change this. Even after 20 years of failed negotiations, the human rights situation has only worsened. While perhaps well-intentioned, negotiations have veiled further entrenchment of the occupation; since the beginning of the “peace process” in 1993, the number of Israeli settlers relocated to illegally seized territory in the West Bank has grown from 262,000 to over 600,000, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. To quote one Palestinian negotiator last year, “It is impossible to negotiate over a pizza while one party is eating it.” This power imbalance motivated Palestinian civil society in 2005 to call for the international community to adopt the nonviolent tactics of boycott, divestment and sanctions following the example of the successful anti-apartheid South Africa campaign. The University, an institution with an enormous endowment and a reputation as a global leader, has set a strong precedent of divesting from companies complicit in human rights violations, including in Darfur in 2006. This divestment campaign aims to discourage companies from contributing to human rights violations and to undermine the occupation’s material means of support. The goal of divestment is not only to cause a downward spiral of decreasing stock value that makes future investment risky, but also to compel these companies to review and change the practices for which they are being targeted. The most common objection to divestment is that it unfairly singles out Israel while other human rights abuses are committed around the globe. On the contrary, the State of Israel has been singled out as the recipient of unparalleled amounts of unconditional U.S. military aid, and American diplomatic support effectively exempts Israel from compliance with international law. The purpose of divestment from the occupation is to hold human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza to the same moral standard as human rights violations committed by any other nation. The authors of this article and many supporters of divestment at the University are actively committed to upholding these same principles of justice worldwide through our work on environmental justice, immigration reform and human rights in Syria, to name only a few. Many governments violate human rights, but in few other cases do Americans and American institutions have such leverage to enact positive changes on the ground. To reiterate, this campaign does not aim to “boycott Israel,” but focuses exclusively on companies complicit in the occupation of the West Bank and siege on Gaza. Nonetheless, some apologists for the occupation have charged that divestment from these companies is in some way anti-Semitic. Regardless of the intent behind them, such accusations offensively equate Judaism with a brutal military occupation and do not contribute in any way to thoughtful, productive discussion. Our University community has the opportunity to align its investments with its most basic values. Failure to divest amounts to sustaining the military occupation of the West Bank and the siege on Gaza, and this institution has a better moral compass than that. We therefore encourage everyone at Princeton — students, faculty, staff and administration — to stand up for human rights and to sign this petition.   Kyle Dhillon ’16 Katie Horvath ’15 Mason Herson-Hord ’15 Debora Darabi ’18|~|
72407|~|Dear white people at “Dear White People” |~|   November 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|It was heartening to see the racial diversity at the screening of the phenomenal new movie, “Dear White People,” at the Princeton Garden Theatre on Nov. 5. From my quick glance at the packed theater as students streamed out at the end of the movie, it seemed like people from a range of races had attended the showing. The crowd, moreover, was almost universally impressed with the quality of the movie, a sleek, savvy take on current issues of racism and racial oppression in the country. It was filled with nuanced characters and adroit takes on microaggressions, and had a noticeable and laudable lack of moralizing or preaching; it invited the viewers to draw their own conclusions from the artfully woven strands of plot loosely tied in a bow at the end. However, I worry that some white people, members of an absurdly and unfairly privileged race, will view this movie as the final step in their conversion from racist to open-minded ally. I can only speak from my own personal experience with race-related issues, and that experience is admittedly incomplete, as I am only in the opening phases of a lifetime of confronting my thoughts on race. That said, “Dear White People” should not, under any circumstance, be the end of a short fight against racism out of which everyone emerges victorious. It might mark the beginning or continuation of some people’s race considerations, but it is absolutely not the final step. The fight against racism is a lifelong battle, and “Dear White People” might be a significant moment in that battle, but white people must never allow themselves to become complacent with their attitudes about oppression. We are all racist to some extent. We are all conditioned by society to make prejudiced assumptions about people based on their gender, race, dress and other visual factors. An important clarification to make, though: racism in the “Dear White People” sense is not necessarily that everyone is of the opinion that people of color are fundamentally worse than whites, but that everyone makes assumptions based on the appearance of others and that everyone has misconceptions of people of color based on society-wide stereotypes. Saying you’re not affected by society’s racist influence is essentially equivalent to saying you are totally untainted by anything you’ve consumed visually or aurally. This can be as small as saying that a black person doesn’t act black — something a friend who attends Harvard has had to deal with on a far-too-regular basis — or calling an opinionated black woman sassy. However, as “Dear White People” points out eloquently, such miniature displays of racism are hurtful. The only way, then, to counter this innate racism is to confront it constantly. It’s a good idea to always check yourself as a member of a privileged class, and it’s worthwhile to realize what you think racial minorities experience and what those minorities actually experience might differ. The movie does a good job in dealing with this, even though the everyday racism and microaggressions are shoved somewhat to the background. Although the white characters in the movie are admittedly caricatural to some extent, there are a lot of very minor, insensitive comments which contribute to the overall unfriendly environment the movie portrays quite well. These comments, unlike the blatantly racist, although unfortunately not unrealistic, party thrown near the movie’s climax, are things you or I might say without a second thought, and it’s worthwhile to consider how potentially hurtful our words can be. The movie’s exposé of these microaggressions is very valuable in confronting our own microaggressions. For example, I know I’ve said a black friend was acting white more than once, something I’m not proud of, but it’s important to understand where I’ve gone wrong so I can improve myself. What’s important, though, is that by not providing a clear solution to fixing the racism inherent in our society, “Dear White People” heavily implies that we are to create our own unique solutions. To me, this is the crux of the movie: it’s a conversation-starter, not a conversation-ender. In general, people who are the target of largely unintentional microaggressions need to understand that many white people (including myself, until about three summers ago) simply haven’t talked extensively about these issues of race and therefore don’t understand how their language could be hurtful. Conversely, white people have to realize that to at least confront their own racism, they need to keep an open dialogue running with ourselves and with others. This leads to my biggest problem with the movie: despite its title, it doesn’t actually address this possible solution. It ends on an “everything is terrible” note instead of suggesting that white people can overcome these barriers by constantly checking themselves at every turn, suggesting that there’s nothing white people can do about their racial biases. Still, I was thoroughly impressed with “Dear White People.” The important thing now, though, is that white people not let the opportunities the movie presented slip away. Confronting racism is a lifelong task, one of which we’ll never really be free, and it’s necessary to continue these discussions. Although each person can choose how to talk about societal norms and pressure, the important thing is that each and every one of us engages in the fight in the first place. “Dear White People” is a fantastic starting point to a thoughtful rejection of racism — let’s just not make it the end.

72362|~|Why working on Wall Street hurts the economy|~|   November 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Coy Ozias|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“My house in the wealthy suburbs of Cherry Hill is predicated on a place like Camden.” I listened to the president of the Center for Environmental Transformation, Mark Dooly, say these words during my Community Action orientation. He explained that most of the local politicians say, “Where should we put the industrial waste plants? Put them in Camden where the people are too poor to protest.” No one wants these things in the suburbs. Camden exists as a slum to support the flourishing of the surrounding exploitative cities. When one brings up these injustices, the common answer is, “Hey, that’s just how capitalism works.” If Cherry Hill exists at the expense of Camden, at whose expense do the University’s wealthy alumni exist? Whenever I tell people that I go to Princeton they seem to always go on about the great, well-paying job I am going to get after college and the fancy cars and houses I am going to be able to buy. Many students came to Princeton for that very reason — to get a high-paying job. But is this endeavor all that noble? Many opinion columns have argued against solely seeking money after graduation, arguing that you should spend your time doing something more productive or fulfilling. I agree with these past columns, but I’d argue that there’s really an economic argument against seeking high-paying jobs as well. The income gap in America today is staggering. It has been growing since the 1970s and continues to widen. What’s even more astonishing is that most people have no idea how large the gap is. When asked to plot on a graph the extent of the gap, most people are grossly off the mark. The top 1 percent of Americans owns 35 percent of the country’s wealth. The bottom 90 percent own only 27 percent of the country’s wealth. Today, the richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans, or half the entire population of the United States. However, this situation is not unprecedented. A similar separation of wealth existed in 1928. This grossly unequal distribution of wealth heralded the stock market crash and the Great Depression. Similarly, in 2007, the country was hit with the “Great Recession.” And what was similar during these two periods? Leading up to the crash, the wealthy continued to turn toward the flourishing financial structure.  This helped create a speculative bubble, a bubble that would eventually burst and send millions of Americans into financial ruins. When Princeton students similarly turn toward the financial structure, they are potentially laying the groundwork for another speculative craze and resulting crash. By going after high-paying “1 percent” jobs, Princeton students are actually hurting our economy and increasing the vastly unequal distribution of wealth that debilitates the middle class. “Sure, major in history, you can still get a job on Wall Street after you graduate.” I have heard many people say this to justify the “study what you love” philosophy at Princeton. Some say that’s what makes Princeton great. You can get a degree in classics, but you can still work in New York and make half a million dollars a year after you graduate. But I contend this is not what makes Princeton great. In fact, it’s what makes Princeton and the entire free market capitalist system shameful. The richest Americans can only buy so many products. The richest 400 Americans cannot buy as many cars as the bottom 150 million Americans. And if all of the excess money the rich have is just being reinvested or saved, it cannot be pumped back into the economy. This concentration of wealth actually hurts our economy and destroys its backbone: the middle class. Princeton students should stop seeing Wall Street and finance jobs as noble and necessary goals because they perpetuate the unequal distribution of wealth that is so harmful to our economy. Many students think that by going to the best university in the nation, they are required to take the highest paying jobs in the nation. With parents paying close to $60,000 a year to send their kids to Princeton, many believe that this investment demands a lucrative career in the financial sector. It’s no wonder the most popular major at the University is economics. It seems most students may not be heeding the “study what you love” mantra and are focusing on economics for a financial payoff after graduation. There should be a greater emphasis placed on opportunities that are less focused on one’s self interest and personal income. Princeton should give greater support to jobs outside of the financial sector. But if you study what you love, why not find a job that allows you to do what you love and avoid hurting the economy in the process? If you are a history major, search for careers that interest you in that specific field. Do not give up on your passion just to make more money on Wall Street. The money won’t make you happy, and in the process you will help create an immoral separation of wealth that hurts all Americans.|~|Coy Ozias is a freshman from Christiansburg, Va.

72339|~|Editorial: Reform midterms to promote fairness and maintain fall break|~|   November 9 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Midterms week is an inherently stressful time when students are required to study for comprehensive tests, learn new material in class and complete papers and problem sets. At the conclusion of midterms week, students are given a week-long break to relax, recuperate and pursue out-of-classroom experiences that supplement their time at Princeton. Unfortunately, the lack of University policies surrounding the administration of take-home exams detracts from the fairness of the examination process and adds stress to the week. Further, the lack of University policies regulating work assigned during fall break dilutes the break’s purpose and is unfair to students attempting to pursue extracurricular, academic and personal opportunities. For students in any given course, schedules during midterms week vary. While one student may have only the take-home exam assigned by the given course due during the week, others may have to study for in-class exams, complete problem sets, draft midterm papers, prepare for precept presentations or any combination thereof. Many take-home midterms, however, do not have a set time limit. This imbalance creates an unfair situation for students who, because of scheduling constraints, do not have as much time to devote to a take-home exam as others. In light of this imbalance, the Editorial Board recommends requiring professors to specify a reasonable amount of time that can be used to complete a take-home exam over the course of an assigned period. Assigning a take-home exam that could be completed in six hours over the course of five days, for example, would standardize the amount of time students could spend on an exam while allowing the flexibility to work around busy schedules. By requiring professors to assign a limited amount of time to complete a take-home midterm, like many already do, students will not be disadvantaged by their choice of course load or break plans. Further, University policy surrounding assigned work during the break following midterms week could also be improved. Originally intended to allow students to participate in national campaigns in the 1970s, Princeton’s fall break lasts the week after midterm periods and allows students to participate in pre-election day campaigning. Though contemporary students are more likely to spend the week on class trips, Breakout trips, completing research for independent work or visiting friends and family, fall break is a critically important time for learning outside the classroom or simply taking a break from the daily stresses of life at Princeton University. Policy, however, does not disallow professors from making midterm papers, take-home exams or other course assignments due during fall break or on the first day of classes following students return. This detracts from the impact of activities undertaken during break and dilutes the full benefits the break is intended to provide. In order to strengthen the benefits of fall break, the Board calls on the University to ban assigning due dates for academic work during fall break and discourage professors from assigning work due on the first meeting of classes after the break’s conclusion. Work assigned so close to the conclusion of fall break implies that the work be completed over break. Such a policy would allow students to focus on the activities they choose to pursue over break. As these activities are worthwhile tools of learning — both as learning experiences outside of the classroom and as respites that allow students to work with renewed vigor upon their return — such a policy would inherently benefit the educational process. By returning academic breaks to their true purposes and addressing inequities in take-home midterms, the University would markedly improve the quality of learning at Princeton each fall.|~|Zach Horton abstains.

72177|~|Climbing life's ladders |~|   November 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|Wikipedia has an entire page dedicated to listing important people who graduated from the University. There are so many politicians who would be listed on that page that the “Politics and Government” section gets its own page. The “U.S. Congress” subsection of that page is similarly privileged. Princeton is good at producing politicians. You could say that Princeton alumni make good leaders. This is unsurprising. Anyone who comes to Princeton is, by necessity, able to navigate the often byzantine college admissions process; the necessary skills and assets translate easily to political campaigning, or climbing through the ranks of businessmen, consultants and financiers. Navigating social, academic and professional hierarchies — from the Street to Wall Street — comes easier to us. But does the preponderance of Princeton alumni at the top of these hierarchies actually show effective leadership, or is it something more nuanced? No doubt we are effective climbers, but I fear we stumble when it comes to making something of the positions we have found ourselves in. More than anything else, the Office of Admission accepts students on the basis of their ability to “play the game” — to convince the right people of their academic worth and potential. This isn’t to say academic ability plays no part in it — indeed, it is far easier to demonstrate such ability when you actually have it — but it is not the only factor. Ambition, charisma and a drive to overcome hardship will also push an application toward success, and this is as it should be. Less ideal are environmental factors — those that come with a lucky birth. Families with the income to fill transcripts and resumes are an invaluable asset in this game, moreso if they hold a Princeton diploma already. Navigating these and other hierarchies comes easily to Princeton students, and we are well rewarded for it. With a median mid-career salary of $121,000 Princeton ranks 6th in Payscale.com’s national rankings of earnings potential. Princeton social science majors, earning $155,000 at mid-career, are the best-paid social science majors in the country. Especially when working directly with people, Princeton students climb this (monetary) ladder extraordinarily well. At the same time, only 46 percent of Princeton alumni felt that their work makes the world a better place. This was well behind the leading school by this measure. Thomas Jefferson University, at 84 percent, and even other Ivies; – Harvard and Yale alums find meaning around 60 percent of the time. Although Harvard and Yale’s numbers are nothing to be proud of — four in 10 alumni don’t think their job improves the world — Princeton’s score here is particularly striking, for a university which prides itself on educating students for work “in the service of all nations.” It seems Princeton succeeds in this measure with less than half of its students. With so many alumni in leadership positions, how can we fail to serve as the University has supposedly taught us? The answer, I fear, lies in the very skill that defines us all: the ability to rise through well-established hierarchies. Consider finance: Michael Gibson, writing in Forbes Magazine, complained earlier this year that more than a third of Princeton students (and similar numbers from Harvard) go straight to finance jobs upon graduation. Worse, they tend toward the large companies, dampening dynamism and rewarding behemoths in an industry in desperate need of more creative destruction and fewer corporate juggernauts. Gibson, and Jonathan Lu in his column, Nerdsniping, sellout style, blame a career office interested in providing safe and conventional success for their charges and boosting quantitative placement metrics. However, the problem extends beyond finance to that field full of leadership positons — politics. Ted Cruz ’92 was criticized for his hollow and pointless “filibuster” against Obamacare last year, a speech clearly calculated to advance his own ambitions. More embarrassing for Princetonians, it later surfaced that, at Harvard Law School, he had refused to study or associate with anyone educated outside Harvard, Princeton and Yale, shunning even those from “minor Ivies.”  I see nothing more in Cruz’s calculated political moves and desire to associate with only the conventionally successful than a calculated move to climb his chosen hierarchy. And in my own field, science, a tenured professorship hardly carries the pay of a banker or the power of a congressman, but the associated independence and security make it a near-equivalent in academia. And it is the path I have set my eyes on, reading up on the key to climbing through graduate school, post-doc and adjunct until reaching the top, with nary a well-informed thought toward other paths. The Peter Principle states that “in a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to their level of incompetence.” That Princeton students are particularly good at rising doesn’t mean that they won’t eventually reach their level of incompetence, where we cannot hope to fulfill Princeton’s values of service. Focusing on the climb isn’t leadership, and definitely isn’t service. While the Career Services can, perhaps, help to avoid this by providing a fuller and more fulfilling slate of options for us, it can only help so much. We, University students and future alumni, must actively search for vocations which, contrary to our tendency to climb, encourage us to serve.  blame a career office interested in providing safe and conventional success for their charges and boosting quantitative placement metrics.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a chemistry major from Littleton, Colo.

72175|~|Editorial: Improve event ticket distribution |~|   November 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|One of the best parts of being at Princeton is the prominent speakers the University attracts. Most recently the University community received a visit from the Dalai Lama on Oct. 28. However, the Dalai Lama’s arrival also shed light on the University’s cumbersome ticketing system, which currently requires students to wait in line at Frist Campus Center during inconvenient time blocks on weekdays, including during scheduled class time. This leads to several problems. The first issue is that, in certain cases, students have to choose between tardiness or absence to a class and waiting in line for a ticket to a promising lecture. While the administration has attempted to mitigate this issue by allowing students to present a maximum of one other prox to get a ticket for a friend, for large-scale events, the student interest is often so great that there are simply too many students with proxes for the few who are actually available to stand in line. This leads to a second problem that arises from the current ticket distribution system: the resale of originally free tickets. In wake of the high demand for Dalai Lama tickets, hundreds of ticket exchanges via the Free and For Sale Facebook page and email listservs were initiated among students, despite the explicit no-exchange policy found on the back of the ticket. While it is arguable that some of these sales were justified given the amount of time spent waiting in line, the only defense of the Office of Religious Life, which sponsored the event, was to send out warning notices to those they discovered selling tickets. If the University wishes to preserve the integrity of free campus lectures and the no-resale policy, a better model for ticket distribution is needed. The Editorial Board proposes that, for future large-scale event ticket distributions, the University use an online lottery system. Such a system would allow all students to request a ticket online during a finite period of time. If the event is oversubscribed, a lottery would be initiated, and only the students randomly selected would be issued tickets. Another benefit of this system is that tickets could be issued to individual students, eliminating the possibility of exchange or resale. Instead, if students can no longer attend an event they requested a ticket for, they can cancel their request on the online system, and the ticket could be reissued via the lottery. While there is a risk that the ease of getting a ticket through a simple request online would cause more negligence in attendance and/or canceling, it is typical to have wait lines outside of popular events to guarantee all seats are filled. In theory, the prevalence of smartphones on campus would allow the University to issue online tickets–potentially with code to be scanned upon arrival at the event. This would be much more convenient for most students and would have the added benefit of helping to cut back on paper waste. For those who do not have a smartphone, they would have the option of printing the ticket out. The Board urges the University to test this ticket distribution method on select large-scale events such as the upcoming lecture by Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan ’81. The following proposal would protect the integrity and efficiency of University-sponsored events. More importantly, the proposed system would allow more students a fair opportunity to learn from and be inspired by the leaders and scholars the University is fortunate enough to host.

72195|~|The importance of clarifying consent |~|   November 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Julia Case-Levine|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|At Princeton, where students are responsible for completing extensive educational courses on sexual assault before even enrolling in classes, and where student-run organizations dedicated to combating assault on campus abound, characterizing consent remains a touchy and controversial subject. Although sexual assault victims don’t always say no, they also don’t always exude enthusiasm and affirmative interest. I have encountered peers who have shared this specific experience with me. In a culture where men are lauded for procuring large numbers of sexual partners, too often the objective becomes to convince partners to engage rather than to honestly verify interest. Instead of seeking out a “yes,” the goal becomes to avoid a “no.” California and New York made history last month with their unprecedented legislation of affirmative consent. Both states plan to implement affirmative consent rules in state-funded schools that underscore that sex is only consensual when both parties have actively said “yes,” These new rules aim not only to challenge how sexual assault is handled in court, but also to shift cultural norms to emphasize sex as mutually agreed upon and instigated. Opponents of the new policy question how officials plan to legislate verbal consent. Will students face scrutiny for failing to verbally ask permission every time things escalate? It’s important to remember that cases where both individuals are clearly interested typically aren’t the ones brought to the disciplinary board. Affirmative consent policy is about more than necessitating verbal cues. It’s about creating an environment where both parties are enthusiastic, willing participants. It’s about changing cultural norms to prioritize positive sex and reforming campus standards. The University’s own policy already emphasizes affirmative and active consent. According to section 1.9.3, “Consensual sexual activity happens when each partner willingly and affirmatively chooses to participate.” However, no single, all-encompassing definition of how this consent is to be expressed exists within the student body. Some students say they look for consent through body language, while others state they prefer to give consent verbally. Opponents of verbal consent argue that “asking” ruins the moment: It’s unnecessary; You already know where things are leading from non-verbal cues; Movies and TV shows popularize consent given through body language; Ryan Gosling isn’t stopping mid-make out to ask Rachel McAdams permission. However, in reality expectations are a bit different than Hollywood would have us believe. In a study reported by the University of Arkansas, only 10 percent of female students stated they gave consent through body language while 61 percent of male students said they inferred consent through body language. Additionally, 51 percent of female students stated they gave consent verbally while only 9 percent of male students said they received consent that way. Because individuals have varying expectations–and as these statistics imply, miscommunication happens fairly frequently–maybe it does make sense to ask. There are times when attaining consent solely from presumed physical cues might not be sufficient. Of course, the real aim of affirmative consent legislation is to promote a culture in which each partner is attuned to the other’s interest; how they get there may vary. What’s important is to cultivate awareness of the importance of actively looking for the “yes” and of expressly asking when there’s uncertainty. Nobody wants to have sex reluctantly. Nobody wants to engage in intimacy simply to avoid name-calling. Conversely, nobody should want to have sex with someone who’s grudgingly consented. If you’re not concerned with whether your partner’s enjoying it, what are you thinking about?|~|

71998|~|The "Cool Girl" phenomenon|~|   November 5 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|In Gillian Flynn’s novel Gone Girl, the basis for a recent popular movie, a specific passage from the book highlights a particularly apt social dilemma women face. The main character Amy Dunne, the titular “gone girl”, says, “Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping”.  The problem with the Cool Girl concept is that she is considered not like “all the other girls” – she is considered superior because of her more masculine interests. Consequently, any women who fall outside of this narrow definition of “cool” are viewed less favorably. A prime example of the superior treatment Cool Girls receive in the media is Jennifer Lawrence, contrasted with another actress, Anne Hathaway. Both Oscar-winning actresses, both young, beautiful, and talented. Yet, Lawrence has become the darling of the American media while Hathaway is bewilderingly vilified. The difference, an article in Vanity Fair argues, is the respective public personalities they’ve conjured. While Lawrence “has become a media darling by showing seemingly little interest in modifying herself for the media, discussing in interviews everything from being ‘uneducated’ to her deep-seated desire to be so unburdened by work that she does not have to change her pants for days on end”, Hathaway was “panned for sweetly taking the microphone during [Les Miserables’s] win so that she could thank people whom she had forgotten on her first trip to the podium” at the Golden Globes. Sasha Weiss of The New Yorker writes, ironically in its article “Anne Hathaway: In Defense of the Happy Girl,” that “I’m not so sure that girls are likeable, and I think this goes for girlish women like Anne Hathaway”.  Weiss also goes onto say that society holds a “suppressed, itchy attitude that is probably more widely held than we’d like to think: the idea that young girls are ridiculous, annoying, and a little disgusting.” Lawrence, who at least in front of the media, harbors more masculine traits, is consequently viewed more favorably. Women tend to be rewarded for having traditionally masculine interests and derided for having traditionally feminine interests, even if those interests should be respected just the same. In her article “The pursuit of frivolity”, Shruthi Deivasigamani notes that female interests such as fashion or boy bands are considered “frivolous” even though male interests such as sports aren’t viewed that way: “People scoff at fashion magazines that list the season’s must-have lipsticks, or splurge-worth blazers, or designer stilettos. The whole field is viewed more often than not as extraneous – fluffy and inconsequential.” Things like fashion cannot even be criticized as unproductive or unessential – that would describe male interests like sports and video games as well – so they are dismissed as trivial – an entirely arbitrary insult. The Cool Girl phenomenon presents women with an unsettling dilemma – to be considered one of the “cool” ones, they have to abandon or conceal traits that are considered feminine. This kind of unnatural, cultivated performance that women must endure has become especially normalized in the workplace. The Internet is full of advice about how not to be considered an “Office Mom,” a role in which you will be marginalized as a woman who has “Advil and tissues in her desk drawer” and “remembers everyone’s birthday and brings in cupcakes.” There is also a stigma against emotion in the workplace, which people argue leads to a lack of professionalism. But the definition of professionalism has been largely normalized by a masculine lens – if emotion was dealt with empathetically and productively instead of treated as a weakness, emotion in the workplace would be seen much more favorably. These altogether harmless behaviors, just like fashion and boy bands, are disrespected and ridiculed simply for being “girly”, and yet, have become widely accepted as professional no-no’s. In order to combat the pervasive status quo that masculine traits and behaviors are superior, women must look at social criticisms they receive using a finer lens. Is the behavior they’re engaging in actually harmful, or is it simply derided because it’s feminine? To answer this question will require a massive shift in perspective, since concealing femininity and accepting masculine behaviors as superior has become so normalized. Fortunately, realizing that our perspectives must change is the first step towards a truly equal society.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

71996|~|Nerdsniping, sellout style|~|   November 5 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jonathan Lu|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“There’s a certain type of brain that’s easily disabled. If you show it an interesting problem, it involuntarily drops everything else to work on it” — xkcd, the popular web comic. I am a nerd through and through. I love math and physics. What is the tension in the middle of a rope hanging between two trees? How many subsets of the set of integers from one to 15 have no two consecutive elements? My idea of fun is an afternoon spent grappling with a hard problem. I am happiest when I am faced with challenging work. At the same time, I want to do something beneficial for the world. I want to do meaningful work — to know that my day-to-day struggles are producing some value for society. Despite this, I find it easy to tune out — to forget about the whole world, all the people and suffering and injustice and everything outside the Orange Bubble, to work on a single math problem. From this perspective, it’s easier to understand a fact that initially shocked me: a lot of nerds end up going into finance and consulting. Under the Office of Career Service’s “What can I do with my major?” site, at least half of the jobs listed, taken by recent physics, math, and molecular biology majors, are in not their respective subjects, but in finance or consulting. The same is true for at least one of the jobs listed under every other science major. Moreover, according to Career Services’ Annual Report 2012-2013, about 25% of the class of 2013 went immediately into finance, insurance or professional, scientific and technical services, including consulting, after graduation. At the Science and Technology career fair, I was drawn to the poster that said, “Challenge your assumptions.” On it was a seemingly simple math problem with arrows drawn between circles and numbers, filling in the blanks. I was thoroughly nerdsniped — the next thing I knew, I had spent 15 minutes just staring at the board. I also checked out the Goldman Sachs booth, just to see what the work was like. The rep intrigued me with descriptions of complex models of markets, of the excitement of not knowing the answer to the question and the challenge of tackling that problem. Finance appeals to nerds because it’s a game, and nerds love to compete. We relish the feeling of doing something difficult and doing it well. A Stanford applied math major described to me his passion for finance: “In the market, you, before anyone else, have to glimpse truth. You have to be the first and be the best.” Perfect, rational precision, with a strong dose of hard work, is a nerd’s cup of coffee. Moreover, finance can sometimes seem like the only option. One alternative, research, can be an unattractive career path. Academia is steadily receiving less funding according to the National Science Foundation, the portion of the federal budget allocated to basic research has been steadily decreasing. Decreasing funding means decreasing salaries; combined with the already hyper-competitive environment of academia, this can make research seem bare of opportunity. So, highly-skilled nerds end up simply going to Wall Street. It seems like a huge waste of their talents. While financial and consulting firms are not necessarily unproductive for society (some are strongly invested in social work), nerds could be doing more. Nerds deserve the opportunity to contribute to society in the best way  they can. The United States should invest far more in basic research. There are fundamental questions to be asked, and nerds  want to answer them: Why not let them? At the same time, we nerds should look beyond our world of super-difficult, hyper-competitive problems. Problems in more applied disciplines, like engineering robots, discovering drugs and writing software, can be just as fulfilling, if not more so, since we would contribute to the world more immediately. It doesn’t even have to be quantitative. We could work on making science accessible for the public, like Neil deGrasse Tyson. We could work in education and ensure that the next generation receives all of the critical thinking and problem-solving opportunities they want. Within the Orange Bubble, we have the fortune to be able to study the problems we want to study. The same cannot be said for the real world. That doesn’t mean we should join investment banks simply to continue solving obscure, difficult problems within our own little bubble. There’s a world out there, nerds. Let’s take it on.|~|Jonathan Lu is a freshman from Fremont, Calif. He can be reached at jhlu@princeton.edu. 
71994|~|Latino leadership critical to classrooms and country|~|   November 5 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Doug Lennox ’09 Last month, the Center for American Progress published a study on the relationship between teacher expectations and student performance. In it, they find that kids whose teachers think they’ll graduate from college are more likely to do so. For those of us who have ever heard the phrase, “I’m not mad, just disappointed,” the finding isn’t all that surprising. We all do things because people expect us to. Without a doubt, some version of this is a part of how many of us wound up strolling down Prospect Ave. But the study also included a finding that doesn’t go down so easily. The report shows that teachers have categorically lower expectations for certain groups of students – namely, children of color and those from a low socioeconomic background. For example, looking at two students – one white, one Hispanic – the average teacher is 42% less likely to think the second one will graduate from college. As someone who has now stood in the classroom as both a Hispanic student and teacher, this concerns me deeply. Findings like these are complex but also point to a critical space in which our campus community must engage more deeply if we are live into the University’s call to the nation’s service. The sad reality is that these differential expectations aren’t altogether unreasonable. In our country, students do graduate from college at wildly different rates, depending on zip code, income bracket and racial identity. In the community where I taught kindergarten and first grade as a Teach For America corps member then alumnus, 10 percent of kids make it to college graduation day. We must come together to think through big solutions and bold ideas to change this. We have to create a system that makes unequal expectations a whole lot less expected. On the way to these systemic solutions, we have the opportunity for direct, immediate impact. For me, the diversity gap between students and teachers served as the catalyst for joining this work. Today, just eight percent of teachers identify as Latino. By 2040, nearly one out of every four US citizens will. This gap has real, immediate implications for Latino students and low-income students of color more broadly. With this in mind, in my Brooklyn classroom, my identity as a Latino teacher shaped many of my school interactions. While most of my students were African-American or of West Indian descent, there was so much we shared. As a Princeton alumnus and Puerto Rican Olympic swimmer, I had the privilege of being a window to the possible, a mirror for my students of color and a pillar of strength for families struggling to keep faith in the possible. But while I’m honored to have served this role so early in my students’ academic lives, Latino men make up less than two percent of our nation’s total educators. That means that, for many of my kids, unless something changes, I will have been both the first and last Latino man they see at the blackboard. As a campus community, we have the opportunity to call attention to this problem and to make choices to address it. I joined Teach For America because I wanted to work with students, families and educators to close the achievement gap. As a result, I became part of a growing network of Latino leaders taking this work on as the organization now stands as one of the nation’s top producers of Latino teachers. It’s a choice that gave me the opportunity to be a meaningful figure in the lives of hundreds of five- and six-year-olds who fundamentally shaped my belief in what’s possible. I’m grateful for their hard work, enthusiasm and authentic joy for learning every day, because they taught me exactly what high expectations and accountability driven by love and support can accomplish. And, now that I work with college student-athletes at Kenyon College, I reiterate to them the golden lesson taught to me by my students: that anything is possible with hard work, smart work and a relentless dedication to do both even when any task seems impossible. The path toward making meaningful change has long been taken by ordinary people who are committed to making the extraordinary possible for others, and it’s time to expect something different. We should expect all students to have equal access to a great education, we should expect compassionate teachers to invest our students in their own future, we should expect support from our schools, we should expect ourselves to contribute to the cause in some fashion and we should expect education reform to become an open discussion on the campus community of which we’re all a part. Please, take the time to make a difference in the lives of others and you will find your reward in the greatest currency our world has to offer: the warmth of a smile, the poignancy of words well written and well spoken and the sincerity of a simple thank-you.

71882|~|Sorry, dude, I have brolates at 4 p.m.|~|   November 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Earlier this year, a new fitness regime made headlines. Broga — a yoga class taught by men, aimed at men. The “Brogram” (this is a real, copyrighted phrase found on the Broga website) aims to strip away the girly stigma associated with regular yoga classes so that men can touch the floor in downward facing dog (downward facing dawg?) without worrying about their reputations. Perhaps after class, bros can join their instructor for frozen brogurt, which is just like frozen yogurt, except the crushed walnuts are swapped out for shaved wood chips and the chocolate syrup for motor oil. Broga is neither the first nor the most recent in a long and already-tired trend of gendering things that don’t need to be gendered at all. Kleenex offers “mansize” tissue boxes because god forbid a man is crying tears (made of kerosene, of course) and only has regular, women’s tissues on hand. Bic offers pens “For Her” so that the delicate female wrist need not wilt under the weight of a regular man-sized pen. Yankee Candle offers “man candles” in scents such as “camouflage” and “man town” (what do either of these things smell like? It doesn’t matter as long as everyone knows that these are manly candles, for men.) Some products are gendered for a reason — vitamin tablets, for example, can be aimed at men and women separately, each offering different concentrations of minerals based on the average female and average male body composition and weight. Shirts can be aimed at genders separately: some allowing for a woman’s smaller stature and others for a man’s broader shoulders. None of these other items — pens, yoga — need to be gendered. There’s no health reason or practical concern instigating the divide. The thing with all unnecessarily gendered products is they aren’t just harmless and cute marketing gimmicks. The selling point of Broga isn’t in the pun in its name or niche-targeting strategy. It’s the fact that it is capitalizing on, rather than assuaging, the insecurity associated with a man doing something classically associated with women. By marketing Broga as something that can instill all the benefits of yoga without any of the feminine subtext, we’re reinforcing the concept that feminine subtext is something somehow undesirable, something that should be shed. “Doodies” (again, I’m not making these names up) are male foodies, a concept elaborated on by Adam Rapoport, the current editor-in-chief of Bon Appétit. “It’s not like when women cook, in terms of nurturing someone,” he told Grub Street. “It’s cooking as sport.” The same methodology is in play here in the masculinizing of cooking as in the masculinizing of yoga. The subject is stripped of its feminine connotations (“nurturing” — even though we’re several decades past the notion that women only cook meatloaf in their kitchens for their husbands to enjoy after work) before being lumped together with some other male stereotype (sports) so that men who enjoy the activity can do so guilt-free without a worry that they might be shown as more feminine or lesser. The shy-away from female attributes starts very early for most boys. The most common thing said to an upset young boy by his well-meaning parent is: “Boys don’t cry.” Boys don’t cry. Girls cry. The fact that you, son, should stop crying has nothing to do with the fact that there are better methods of conflict resolution. Rather, it has to do with the fact that you don’t want to be seen as a girl — the ultimate insult. And it continues into childhood: “You run like a girl” is an insult, even when the recipient of the statement is a girl. Girly attributes are to be avoided at all costs — and the mindset instilled in young boys grows into an innate sense of sexism as they grow in their teens and early adulthood. This is why feminism is important for both men and women: It allows a full range of emotions, careers and hobbies for both genders without any useless and unnecessary asterisks to justify it. Men (and boys) are allowed to cry — on the playground, post-breakup, after a midterm on campus or just because. We don’t need to gender every action we take. Men are allowed to go to yoga and eat brunch and drink mimosas, and it doesn’t need to be called anything different.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a molecular biology major from Cresskill, N.J.

71864|~|What will it take for Princeton students to step up?|~|   November 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|Last Wednesday, students across the world carried their mattresses to support Columbia University student Emma Sulkowicz and to raise awareness about sexual assault on college campuses. Students from over 130 campuses participated, including Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Michigan, Northwestern, Syracuse, Rutgers and the Central European University in Hungary. Politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) tweeted support. Seeing this wide national and international campus support is so inspiring as it reveals how many people acknowledge that the fight against sexual assault needs attention from society and policymakers across the country and around the world. Sexual assault policies have been front and center these past six weeks as the University discussed and then changed its policies on sexual misconduct. The changes have both vocal support and opposition, yet no one has taken a stand on either side outside of the official forums for discussion (which are poorly attended by the student body). Granted, it isn’t surprising that Princeton did not participate in Carrying The Weight’s worldwide protest on Oct. 29 — we were on fall break, after all. But it does raise the question: What will it take for Princeton students to step up and publically protest and fight for changes surrounding issues they care about and that could impact them directly? The University has a reputation for being conservative and not wanting to make waves through protests — a sharp contrast to Columbia. However, I truly believe this isn’t just about apathy and indifference, as many people I know do have strong opinions on the sexual assault policy changes (although plenty of students are still unaware of either the new or old sexual assault policies). I think the root of the problem is twofold among those who do have strong opinions. First, there is a stigma against activism on Princeton’s campus, and second, there is an organizing dilemma among activists here. Raising your voice too loudly at the University and challenging the status quo is not generally admired among students; rather it is denigrated. Even though the 2011 Steering Committee on Undergraduate Women’s Leadership report analytically proved there was a problem with the lack of women’s leadership on campus, there seemed to be a largely negative or at least indifferent reaction to the recent provocative Women’s Center posters meant to spark discussion on these issues. Activism off campus, such as last year’s delegation to the XL Keystone pipeline protest in D.C. or this September’s participation in the Climate Charge March, are extremely important, yet, they seem to bring little activism, discussion or change to campus. Granted, there was a demonstration at Frist Campus Center about the pipeline last spring, but little came from it, and, unfortunately, many students ridiculed the actions. The demonstrations by Students for Prison Education and Reform about solitary confinement are usually ignored too, as people just walk by the box outside Frist. And the fact that so few Princeton students vote and that students consider this normal is just another manifestation of how this stigma against fighting for an issue has led to apathy and inaction. Princeton students, faculty and the administration need to be more supportive of activism. Whether people support a particular position, we need to respect those who are brave enough to speak up and then take action. Unfortunately, due to our campus climate, students will likely receive ridicule for saying and doing something disruptive publically; this means it is especially important for those who do acknowledge the importance of taking action to give these students the respect and admiration they deserve. Supporting the act of taking action is different from supporting the position itself. Supporting the act of taking action will hopefully lead to more action on both sides of issues. However, I don’t think this stigma is the only obstacle to activism at the University. There is a will among a minority of students to be vocal despite Princeton’s social norms. Part of the University’s problem is organization and communication among those who have specific issues about which they are passionate. For example, Sally Frank ’80 spoke on campus a few weeks ago about her 11-year-long successful effort to end male-only eating club policies at Princeton. When a student asked what we could do to protest current sexist Bicker processes, Frank suggested that students should protest by not joining and perhaps even picketing outside the club during Bicker. I have no doubt that there are at least a handful of students on campus who are more than happy to participate in such a protest, including me. But how would like-minded students find each other to organize such a protest? This lack of a communication vehicle is a huge detriment to our ability to take collective action on campus. Perhaps more Undergraduate Student Government town halls can help students identify similarly minded students as issues develop. Special-interest student groups are also helpful, although they tend to focus on off-campus issues versus those on campus. Organizing similar groups for campus issues could help coordinate action. Potential organizations such as the Pace Center for Civic Engagement, the Women’s Center or the American Whig-Cliosophic Society could try to fill this niche to encourage more activism on campus as well as off campus. Hopefully, Carrying The Weight or another external organization or even Princeton students themselves will motivate more students to make their voices heard, and no one will deride these students for expressing their passion and concern. Many of us want to be leaders. What are we waiting for? The issues are upon us.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu. 
71850|~|Why everyone needs to go see 'Dear White People'|~|   November 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|Last week, I saw “Dear White People,” a movie that follows the adventures of a group of black students at Winchester University, a fictional Ivy League school. The movie details the existence and rationale behind a blackface party put on by some of the school’s white students. The film is a comedy, and it is wickedly hilarious. More importantly, however, it starts a dialogue on several often ignored, incredibly important racial issues on today’s college campuses. It also does the useful service of presenting black characters that are allowed to be difficult and sometimes unlikeable without being cartoonish villains. It gives us black characters taking center stage, for once, not bobbing their heads sassily in the corner as the white protagonist leads the movie. For these reasons, I believe that everyone should go to the free screening of “Dear White People” at the Princeton Garden Theatre on Wednesday night, presented by the Fields Center, Princeton Latinos y Amigos, the Black Student Union and Princeton Asian American Students Association.  The film has enormous potential to spark conversation, especially because of its setting at a fictional Ivy League school and thus its subsequent similarity to Princeton and the racial issues that permeate this campus. In order for the film to do its job, though, it is important that a variety of people go see it. Campus events intended to promote dialogue, such as this one, can easily fail to be productive due to their self-selecting attendees. The sort of people who are inclined to go to such events are often the sort of people who already are thinking about the issue that the event coordinators want to raise awareness about. Even more counterproductive is the echo chamber that must then form. Because everyone who goes to the event already thinks in the same way, there is no discussion or dialogue. It’s just a bunch of people agreeing with one another. Therefore, I challenge you to go to Wednesday night’s screening, especially if you are the sort of person who is not normally inclined to go to events focused on issues of diversity. I think the movie has the potential to expand people’s horizons, but we have to the take the first step: actually going to see it. That is not to say that there is no value in going if you are already interested in these sorts of discussions. Obviously, there can be a great deal of emotional validation in seeing characters and situations you know to exist finally represented on the big screen. And, of course, the movie is really, really funny; it has significant artistic and entertainment value. “Dear White People” is not a perfect movie. From a technical standpoint, it is frequently amateurish. The writer-director’s relative inexperience becomes obvious through his occasional reliance on clichés, both in the screenplay and in the choice of music. However, these issues are thankfully overshadowed by well-drawn characters and clever jokes. The film is also not to be taken as the final word on race relations on college campuses. Some of the politics of the movie are problematic. I don’t want to get into spoilers, but the way hair was treated has drawn some criticism. More obviously, the choice to use a light-skinned girl as the lead was also considered disappointing by some. Finally, the agency of female characters has been questioned, leading to charges of possible misogyny. Although these and other issues could have been treated differently or more sensitively, that does not change the efficacy of the film as a conversation starter among Princeton students. This flawed movie is a very valuable tool, and I hope that everyone chooses to use it, whether or not they generally engage in diversity initiatives on campus. Go to the Garden Theatre Wednesday night at 8 p.m. You won’t regret it.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va. She can be reached at zmubarak@princeton.edu.

71760|~|Princeton years vs. life years |~|   November 3 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|This past month, Princeton became the first town in New Jersey to earn a place in the World Health Organization’s global network of “age-friendly” communities. The criteria for this distinction includes availability of affordable housing, transportation and access to social interaction. All in all, it seems that Princeton makes a good home for the elderly. This news got me thinking about age, something that is less noticeable as I spend most of my time surrounded by people my age. Understandably, Princeton’s “age-friendly” status matters little to us, a group of young students who, for the most part, have little need for housing in town or access to social functions for the elderly. But this facet of off-campus Princeton life could serve as a reminder that age is not always defined by the categories of freshman, sophomore, junior or senior. Although nearly all of us fall into the same age group, we vary in age in ways that are not always reflected by the year that we will graduate. Some students are young for their class — they may have started schooling early or skipped a grade or, in the case of a few, began at the University as sophomores (I found out recently that I am the same age as my peer academic adviser, a senior who began as a sophomore). There is a sizable group of students who have taken gap years, not only before beginning here but also at other points in the Princeton experience. I have heard many gap year stories, from working at home as an EMT or ESL teacher to going abroad to volunteer at an NGO fighting human trafficking in India. I met one student who served in the Korean military for two years between sophomore and junior years. But for the most part, the different ages of these students show only in subtle ways. This is mainly because the age difference is usually small. A year away from school can be pivotal, but that doesn’t change everything. 18- to 21-year-olds socialize together, and one year more or less doesn’t fundamentally alter the way one interacts with peers. Still, the fact that one’s age is defined by graduation year indicates to me that we define maturity in this same way. Over the four years here, students learn an incredible number of things about intellectual pursuits as well as personal relationships. But students also learn how to get on “the list” or how to act in pointless Bicker scenarios, graduate from the initiated to the initiators in their dance groups or sports teams and memorize frat songs. These things matter, obviously, to the culture. They can be fun for some people while sometimes elitist to others. But the fact that, all joking aside, these kinds of things are actually important to some is evidence of the divide between “Princeton years” and “life years.” I don’t mean to make a high-minded argument about the tomfoolery of “kids these days.” I honestly don’t care too strongly about harmless shenanigans. We may be adults, but we’re not “grown-ups.” However, the point when things like initiations and eating club memberships, which are so specific to life inside the Bubble, become signals of experience and maturity demonstrates the problem with the “Princeton years vs. life years” divide. The world, as we all know but may sometimes forget, does not operate according to the mindset of people our age. As with plenty of other issues here, this divide is a matter of perspective. But it’s not about gap year students having perspective and everybody else lacking it; it is important instead to remind ourselves that we have different kinds of experiences, spent inside or outside of school. A year more or less of age does make a difference, and maturity is something independent of those things unique to campus life that will cease in a few years to have any relevance to one’s life. This is probably an observation about college life in general, not just about Princeton, and I don’t think that we worry too much about the distinctions between different years. We all have friends from different classes, and we mix together easily. However, I still think that perceptions of age and maturity are affected too much by arbitrary bits of campus culture. This is why anyone who has had life experience in the past few years outside of the Bubble or high school has a right to be irritated that this outside experience is so often less relevant to social life here than familiarity with the idiosyncratic norms of campus culture. When every so often I venture off campus, I enjoy confirming my suspicions that young adults like myself do not make up the large majority of the world’s population. I like to know now that this town is welcoming not only to the young but also to older people as well. Princeton comprises only a small part of one’s life, and even among students here, there is a variety of age, experience and maturity that is only partially reflected by one’s status as a freshman, sophomore, junior or senior. Let’s keep this in mind when we think about how we can grow as students, musicians, athletes, artists, scientists and individuals.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I.

It’s hard to deny it as an entity or to ignore the logic that underwrites its existence. In an environment in which students flit about from one activity to another, it stands to reason that this insular focus becomes exaggerated due to time constrictions. That’s not to say, however, that the logic of it all explains away the detriment caused by becoming isolated from the outside world. The Orange Bubble’s harm as an entity, though, extends beyond this relative ignorance of current events to a relative ignorance of oneself. All of the people I’ve met here are incredibly thoughtful, and I’ve had countless conversations in which jokes have given way to comments that belie deep introspective tendencies. Many of my friends cite a desire to begin to care for and understand themselves as a way to further their academic and personal goals. They reason that one cannot provide for others without first doing so for oneself and that acknowledging limitations and overcoming them is necessary in all areas but particularly within the context of academia. Such conversations, however, seem to wane as time passes, as midterms, finals and deadlines bear down on all of us, and in my experience, I have often stopped prioritizing this type of goal in favor of grades, extracurriculars or interpersonal relationships. Again, such a shift makes sense. When traveling at warp speed and sometimes feeling as if you’re still not moving fast enough, stopping to “check in” with yourself can feel impossible, simply impractical or, to go to an extreme, a waste of time. This, to me, is the value of fall break and why I didn’t make any explicit plans. In addition to the work that I either procrastinated on or decided to do early (aka start and procrastinate on), I needed to spend some time reflecting upon my actions and decisions. Some of them naturally configured with the person I hope to be, but, equally as naturally, some of them deviated sharply. Removed from the hotbed of emotions that is often cultivated when you have so many people living together in a high-stress environment, I could take the time to consider my decisions — both from my own point of view, taking care to comprehend the “why” behind every misstep, as well as from the perspectives of the other people involved. I don’t pretend to know how to rectify many of the mistakes that I’ve made even after my attempts to analyze them, nor how to alter my general life trends without enforcing radical changes. However, in taking the time to honor myself and my choices, faulty or not, I also gain a greater appreciation for those around me and am able to honor my relationships with them in a way I cannot when the only time for reflection comes on the walks between Frist Campus Center and Rockefeller College. I’m able to recognize all that the people in my life do for me and for others, their unique points of view and places in which communication and other important aspects of our relationship can still be improved. I wish that I took this time more frequently. I don’t pretend to know how to make time for this introspection on a regular basis during the school year, in a similar way to the manner in which I don’t know how to make time for the recommended eight to nine hours of sleep every night. All I can advocate for is the concerted effort on breaks or three-day weekends or even a Friday afternoon to check in with oneself and to value that type of information just as much, if not more, than the configuration of a specific carbon compound or a series of vocabulary words in a foreign language. Without a doubt, physical distance from the University is helpful, but even just venturing to a part of campus that is relatively unfamiliar or walking down Nassau Street can be enough emotional distance to begin to pop the Orange Bubble in this way. It’s a difficult task, but it’s as crucial to future success as any singular grade.|~|Kelly Hatfield is a sophomore from Medford, Mass. She can be reached at kellych@princeton.edu. 
71720|~|Study Abroad Chronicles: Princeton’s printing problem|~|   November 3 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The University spoils us in many ways: from late meal to endless T-shirts to extended library hours. Studying abroad has reminded me of these incredible privileges that most students in the United States and around the world will not access during their time in college. However, this convenience clouds our vision, and our pinnacle of privilege is perhaps most apparent in the way we treat printing. Printing here at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London as well as at most universities around the world is not free. Students are allotted 10 free credits (equal to around 100 pages) at the beginning of the term and then must “top up” their student ID with five pence per black and white printed page. As a history student, I used my free printing quota for my first class session. The last printing statistic available on the University’s website is for the 2008-09 academic year when Princeton students printed 11,040,632 sheets of paper, enough to stretch from Princeton to Salt Lake City, or a stack 17 times taller than Fine Hall. Catchy statistics aside, this is a serious problem — we are all at fault and all together in the solutions. I had always justified my printing habits because I found I had trouble reading off a computer screen. I like annotating and highlighting readings for reference or reading straight from a book checked out from the library and taking notes in a notebook. This is extravagant. Every undergraduate student is allotted 2,100 black and white, as well as 200 color sheets per academic year. Graduate students are allotted 3,000 and 200, respectively. Faculty and staff have no print quota, according to the Help Desk. As a “sheet is defined as an actual piece of paper,” students are encouraged to make the most of their printing quota by printing double-sided. If they run out of printing quota, they can just email and receive an additional quota. Most students I’ve talked to who have asked for the additional quota do receive it. The University is doing its part. Since the first Sustainability Plan came out in 2008, the University has been releasing reports on its progress toward a more sustainable Princeton. In 2013, the University increased its purchasing of general use office paper to 98 percent and increased the portion of purchasing remanufactured printer cartridges to 23 percent. Paying for printing has forced me to reconsider how I study and change my habits. I now make an effort to read straight from the books in the library or off my laptop. I am upset that it has taken this long for me to realize my printing opulence. Whether an environmentalist or an economist, there are many arguments to be made for saving paper on campus by changing our printing habits. Although student printing accounts for only 20 percent of Princeton’s paper consumption (the rest goes to posters, stationery and invitations), we should listen a little more past the sound of printers and more to the sound of the felled trees. At this point, I don’t think we can eliminate paper consumption at the University. However, as the “print less” website offers, there are many solutions: taking notes digitally, printing with smaller fonts and margins and selectively printing. Let’s listen to The Lorax: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot/Nothing is going to get better. It’s not.” Change at a university often starts with students. Let’s reconsider our printing habits — take the time to print thoughtfully, make the effort to read from library books and remind each other to consider each page before printing it. The average Princeton student uses 1,300 sheets per year, and the number has been steadily increasing since 2004. If each student (undergraduate and graduate) decreased his usage by 500 sheets of paper per year, we would save 1,000 miles of paper. Perhaps the 500 sheets could be saved by copying lecture slides by hand instead of printing them off Blackboard or reading from a book in the library instead of printing out the chapters. It doesn’t have to be New Year’s to set resolutions: Let’s try to decrease our printing this November at the very least by making ourselves aware of our waste. After all, I haven’t yet mentioned my favorite way in which the University spoils us: the kaleidoscope of magnificent trees.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

71601|~|Leveling the precept playing field |~|   November 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|A few days ago, after spending much of fall break recovering from the waves of pre-midterm stress, I was finally coherent enough to talk with some fellow classmates about the tests, what we thought of them and how well (or poorly) we thought we did on the exams (we may or may not have also taken bets on how low the curve would be). From the conversations I had, it became readily evident that we all utilized largely the same resources when preparing for the midterm — the same practice tests and previous exams on Blackboard, the same notes and class materials, the same textbooks and reading materials, the same office hours. But one factor stood out as a stark difference among many of us — our precepts and our preceptors. In most introductory level classes, all of the precept sections are more or less the same, since the graduate students and professors who lead them generally follow an outlined curriculum that complements the contents of the class lectures. All students in a course would thus receive the same information, tips, hints and ideas, more or less. In the more discussion-based precepts, the students would participate in discussions about largely similar topics. More advanced courses, however, seem to give the preceptors greater reign over the structure of the precept section. In science and math classes, this means that while one instructor may spend an entire precept performing proof after proof of the concepts outlined in class, a different preceptor is liable to instead spend that time solving practice problems, providing additional material to supplement the core concepts, or reviewing homework questions; the list goes on and on. In humanities-based courses, such a disparity is likely to result in precepts discussing and debating different ideas, which, inevitably, may result in different groups drawing different conclusions. I am not implying that non-uniformity of precepts is inherently negative; after all, all students probably have their own unique perspective about the course materials, and given the eclectic mix of precept participants, the content of each precept will inevitably differ. Likewise, precept instructors are mostly graduate students (and occasionally professors) who, just like their students, possess their own sets of views about the topics and hence will lead their own sections accordingly. At the same time, standardizing the precepts could help address several concerns regarding the perceived sense of fairness surrounding them. For one, if two different preceptors cover two different topics, and if one of those topics happens to arise on an exam, one set of precept section students would have a clear advantage over the other. Similarly, if one preceptor spends time solving example problems while another focuses solely on, say, performing proofs, then the former group of students may have an easier time handling exam questions than the latter. Even if different preceptors cover the identical materials during their sections, they are likely to teach the topics differently, or in varying capacities — one may be more thorough, more clear or more coherent than the other. In order to quell such concerns, a degree of precept standardization may be in order. The change doesn’t have to be a large one — perhaps the head of each course can ensure that each preceptor covers the same core materials during each session so as to give all students the same type and degree of preparation. As mentioned above, different precept sections, particularly in the humanities, are likely to end up deviating from each other in the types of dialogue they foster, but at least all students will be able to leave their precept with a good sense of which main topics they should be familiar with, even if their conclusions on those topics may differ. Alternatively, preceptors can rotate on a weekly or monthly basis, so that different sections will get to be taught, sooner or later, by all of the instructors. Cycling through preceptors will also ensure that different instructors effectively implement consistency throughout all precept sections. After all, the material that is taught one week must be fluidly picked up and continued by a different preceptor during the next session, necessitating uniformity of content. Precepts are one of the cornerstones of Princeton’s academics, and they are advertised as one of the foremost ways in which students are given an opportunity to hone their intellect by discussing course materials among their peers. Seeing as precepts are so integral to academic life here, it may behoove us to consider standardizing them so that all students can partake in an experience that is wholly positive across the board.|~|Jason Choe is a sophomore from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

71637|~|Editorial: Stop, drop and roll out some fire safety changes|~|   November 2 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|For many University students, on-campus housing and fire safety policies are pervasive. While safety is the stated rationale for all policies, some policies in place — for example, the University’s current microwave and door-hanging restrictions — are both overly strict and ambiguous as to their specific purposes. The Editorial Board recommends that the housing and fire safety committees either reevaluate these policies, or provide specific rationales for these policies to students. Despite its current policies, the University is still not among the top schools in the state for fire safety ratings, as awarded by the Princeton Review. Two schools, the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Montclair State University, both received top scores of 99 (on a 60-99 scale). However, the University, which received a score of 89, prohibits students keeping microwaves in their dorms that are not rented through the University’s Student Agencies department, unlike NJIT and Montclair State, which both allow microwaves in student dorms. Dormitories Manager Ken Paulaski said that the primary reason microwaves are not permitted in student rooms is that “not all dormitories can handle the electrical load required for microwaves.” Paulaski said that MicroFridges — a brand which offers an all-in-one refrigerator, freezer and microwave — are permitted because they are designed so that when the microwave is operating the power to the refrigerator is inactive until the microwave is not in use. However, at $289 for only a year, the permitted devices require a significant cost for students to rent temporarily. Though some Princeton dormitories are older and may not possess the electrical capacity to run microwaves of a certain voltage safely, this does not necessarily require a universal ban. Rather, like both NJIT and Montclair State, a more liberal option could be to restrict the power capacity of dorm microwaves.  At any rate, regardless of whether microwaves could be allowed in the future, it would be reasonable for the housing and fire safety offices to make the rationale for these policies easily available to students. In addition to the microwave ban, the Board suggests that current policies prohibiting students from attaching posters and other signs to their dorm room doors have specific rationales posted online, especially since other institutions such as Columbia, Brown and Cornell allow students to post signs on the exterior of their doors (some with certain size restrictions, such as an 8½-by-11 piece of paper in the case of Cornell). Even if a large poster on a door truly does block the “means of egress,” a small paper or name sign would pose much less of a hazard and should be acceptable. In light of these examples, the Board recommends that the University fire safety and housing offices reconsider current policies — in particular, the current microwave ban and means of egress policy — and, if the policies should stand, add a section on either department’s webpage explaining their specific rationale for the policies. Though these policies may seem like small matters, they are often nuisances in students’ daily lives, and clearly justifying them would lead to a homier and safer living space for all students.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The board answers only to its Chair, the Opinion Editor and the Editor-in-Chief. 
71649|~|Letter to the Editor: Princeton is not for profit |~|   November 2 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|To the Editor: The Daily Princetonian has published several articles recently that refer to a lawsuit filed in New Jersey tax court that challenges Princeton University’s exemption from taxes on properties that support its educational mission. To prevail, the plaintiffs will need to persuade the court that Princeton has ceased to be an educational institution and instead has become an entity whose dominant motive is to make a profit. No one can argue in good faith that Princeton’s dominant motive is anything other than to be the best educational institution it can possibly be. As an educational institution, Princeton’s mission is to educate students and generate new knowledge and new ideas. It does these things not only for their students’ own sakes, but to serve the public good by preparing and encouraging students from a broad range of backgrounds to aspire to positions of leadership and lives of service, and by making discoveries that lead to advances in a broad range of fields that have a direct impact on the broader society — fields ranging from medicine and the environment to technology and public policy. The University generates revenues to support its educational mission through endowment earnings, charitable gifts and tuition and other charges, and it spends its revenues to achieve this mission. Both state and federal tax policies enable educational institutions to maximize the extent to which their revenues can be used to support their missions. The University also generates a small fraction of its budget through patents and royalties, and it similarly invests those revenues to advance its educational mission. Even with a successful patent, the revenues that come to the University are dwarfed by the investment the University makes in creating the conditions that allow our faculty to do the research that leads to the ideas that eventually lead to the patent. Federal law and policy strongly encourage research universities to work with outside partners to convert intellectual property into products and services that meet human and societal needs. This is fully consistent with a mission that seeks to serve the public good through the discoveries and insights that arise out of the core mission of teaching and research. The federal Bayh-Dole Act provides guidance on how this is to be done. A number of the practices that are being challenged by the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are specifically required by Bayh-Dole, and they are followed by research universities throughout the country. When the University hires someone to help make connections with companies that might be interested in the intellectual property created by our faculty through their research, or works with congressional staff or federal agencies on matters related to tax or patent policy, it is working within the framework and spirit of the Bayh-Dole Act on matters that enhance the University’s capacity to achieve its educational mission and contribute to the public good.

71640|~|On gym culture|~|   November 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jonathan Lu|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|My first few weeks in college were exciting but unstable. Between meeting people of completely different backgrounds, checking my conduct in new social situations (never required in laid-back California) and carving out a new community for myself, I missed the sense of stability from home. Though learning to navigate a new social landscape was an important growing experience, I needed routine. I needed purpose. I needed a place where I could be my most primitive, honest self. So I went to the gym. A good workout solves most of life’s problems. The gym was refreshing after several weeks of culture shock. I had no pressure to talk to anyone, but I could if I wanted to. In the gym, it is easy to connect with others, since we all share a willingness to work hard and see ourselves grow. It’s as if we shed our social barriers when we put on our workout clothes. Unlike any clique or eating club, the gym is truly open to all. The gym can and should be the most welcoming and positive place on campus. Newcomers can find the gym intimidating, though. There are so many people in their prime doing muscleup burnouts, running five-minute miles, and squatting 200 pounds. Every person is very focused on his or her routine; you seem to be the only person who is lost. The gym is also filled with all sorts of weights, barbells, ellipticals and machines. Newcomers may not know where to start or how to do exercises correctly. This discomfort evaporates when you just talk. Whenever I am confused about my exercise form or workout structure, I ask for other people’s help. No one has ever laughed at me for my lack of knowledge or my physique (which is lanky and markedly un-buff). The people I meet at the gym are positive: They accept their body types, but test their limits. They’re willing to help others do the same. Every technique I’ve learned (suck your stomach in when you plank) and habit I’ve cultivated (stretch deeply after leg day) has come from talking to people. Sometimes the camaraderie comes to you. I have made some great friends from simply sharing equipment. We help each other move weights, spot each other to prevent injuries, and encourage each other: “Come on, last rep, Adrian. Push through!” Moreover, countless strangers have gone out of their way to tell me when I am doing an exercise wrong. Such actions are human caring at its finest, unblemished by ulterior motives. Personal connections aside, there is something inherently positive about a place where people sweat, gasp, growl and scream. The gym is filled with an intensity that is inspiring. I want to work as hard as that guy sprinting on the treadmill, that girl digging deep to finish the last burpee. We find connections with people we don’t even know. We push ourselves more than we could alone. The gym doesn’t just make you fit. It makes you better at life. A man named Charlie, who I met at my gym back at home, told me he used to be a loser in high school. He was lazy and had no aspirations. In the summer after his senior year, he decided to start working out. His routine gave him something to structure his daily life around. Moreover, it taught him to never be satisfied with what he had at the moment. He began setting goals. Because of his dedication, he increased his vertical jump from 24 to 38 inches. He also went from living with his parents to attending to a state university to getting a job at Google. We do not go the gym to compete. We go to become better people, to gain from each others’ successes, to help each other achieve, to be inspired by each others’ strength of will. There is no social awkwardness here: We all sympathize on the most primitive, natural level. Here, we learn, teach, suffer and grow. We, the Princeton community, should make the gym the most open, positive place on campus. At a school where people join exclusive eating clubs, stick with their same old cliques and do the same activities in which they have always succeeded, our gym can come across as silent, intense and restricted. We need to change that closed atmosphere. For those of you who have never touched a dumbbell, who think you don’t have the right body type, who think you are not masculine enough, it doesn’t matter: Come to the gym. To succeed at the gym, you only need two things, both of which you can control: a desire to work hard and a willingness to ask for help. This is all backed by personal experience. For those of you gym regulars: Think of all the mentors who saved you from pulling a muscle, gave you tips to stay healthy or simply inspired you to achieve your goals. Be that mentor. If you see a person piking when he does a pushup, correct his form. If someone is squatting for the first time, spot her. And for everyone: Talk to strangers. Learn from each other, teach each other. Save the elitism for the eating clubs. At the gym, we should just all be fellow human beings.|~|Jonathan Lu is a freshman from Fremont, Calif. He can be reached at jhlu@princeton.edu.

71234|~|Study Abroad Chronicles: Honest precept|~|   October 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Asking about precept is like asking about jaywalking: awkward, exhilarating, scary, satisfactory. We can all admit that we arrive to precept on a sliding scale of preparedness: entering with a typewritten outline of main points and an argument, glancing quickly at the end of an article to find the conclusions or hoping the preceptor shows up late. The preceptorial system was loosely based on the tutorial systems of universities in the United Kingdom. As I enter my fourth week here, I want to reflect on how similar and different these two systems are. Tutorials here are both terrifying and refreshing. I’ll focus specifically on my first tutorial for a history class. As we settled into class, we all introduced ourselves and our background in the subject. The professor then simply asked, “Who did all the readings?” I was stunned. It is expected at Princeton that we have read everything, and, we assume that if you have not read, you will comment anyway to save your participation grade. The result is a hit-or-miss discussion that frustrates both students and preceptors. In a tellingly cheesy brochure about precept titled “Inspired Conversations,”  former University President Robert F. Goheen ’40 commented, “Discrimination between ‘bull’ and serious mindwork is certainly an essential task for the preceptor.” We all know precept often does not do justice to its lofty goals of “active engagement” and “vigorous intellectual interchange.” Back to England. My professor specified each author from the syllabus and noted who had read each book or article. After seeing a few others raise their hands, I shyly raised mine, feeling confident that I had prepared enough for this first class. The professor then proceeded to facilitate the discussion asking specific textual questions to those who raised their hands. (I felt grateful that I had not exaggerated.) If she accidentally asked a question to someone who had not read a certain article, the student would immediately admit that he was unable to comment. In the tutorial system, the professor distinguishes “core readings” and “suggested readings.” This is especially helpful in making the discussion productive; the students know exactly which pieces will be discussed at length, and which to read if one desires a deeper understanding. This honest environment — both of students feeling open to admit how much they have read, and of professors acknowledging how much reading is possible per week by distinguishing the most important pieces — fosters a highly productive discussion. I have learned from my classmates, and those who are unprepared do not have to spend time worrying if the professor will call them out, or if they will have to braid a comment from the crumbs of skimming. As grades do not depend on “participation points,” students are incentivized to come to tutorial prepared with questions they actually want to ask their peers, and professors are incentivized to lead a discussion that will deepen their understanding, instead of constantly checking the quality or quantity of each student’s contributions. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not possible to pass a class in the United Kingdom without reading, nor is tutorial an opportunity for a few to command the conversation. On the contrary, almost all students come prepared with questions and short analyses, and the atmosphere feels more dynamic than any precept I’ve experienced in my time at the University. After that first particular tutorial, the professor asked two of the students who did not read to prepare a five-minute presentation of the next week’s readings. Princeton precepts often fall into a rhythm: certain students who dominate discussion on the first day of class are then expected to spark it for the next 11 weeks. It is unclear, even for preceptors I have spoken with, how exactly they are expected to grade students. Preceptors complete a short training session, but for the most part, the grading and structuring process remains equivocal on both sides. Students in the past have written about restructuring precept, changing the grading system and including short quizzes in precepts. Even Urban Dictionary has noticed: It defines precept as a “generally useless discussion section for a class at Princeton University.” Precept, as a concept, is motivating: putting one expert in a room with 11 aspiring experts is a chance for us to change and challenge our understanding of a particular topic. Whether the solution is eliminating grades or changing the structure of precept, I think the change should start with us. If we, as students, can foster a supportive atmosphere where it is okay to admit to not reading, we all benefit from less precept anxiety. If we, as students, ask our preceptors to be more clear about grading expectations, we can step farther away from unproductive discussions based on quantity of comments. If we, as students, admit we are unable to comment about something, we will all learn more from deeper discussions based on analyses from peers who have read. Precept is of the students, by the students and for the students, and is a significant part of our academic experience here. Like us, it has great potential for success. If we want to shift the system toward more honest and interesting discussions, we must start with ourselves.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

71450|~|Editorial: Introduce flex dollars into meal plans|~|   October 23 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|The University offers many dining options for students, ranging from meal plans for underclassmen to options such as eating clubs for upperclassmen. Dining is essential to community building, as it gives students the opportunity to interact with others outside of their classes and residential colleges. It is for this reason that the University provides some dining hall swipes for upperclassmen and that eating clubs offer meal exchange programs. Burdensome restrictions, however, make these options inconvenient to use, and more can be done to increase the flexibility of dining options for all students. By making dining more flexible, students will be given more opportunities to interact with others outside of their set dining plans. For this reason, the Editorial Board believes that the University should replace Late Meal swipes with a system of flex dollars, a form of cash credit that can be used at on-campus dining locations. Furthermore, the Board encourages eating clubs to adopt an electronic system for meal swipes. Currently, our Late Meal system gives cash credit to all students on an unlimited meal plan. All students with the unlimited plan, regardless of whether or not they have swiped into a dining hall meal, are covered up to $5.95 for lunch and $6.95 for dinner. For those on a block plan, it covers a swipe if you didn’t swipe into lunch or dinner that day. While Late Meal strives to provide flexible dining hours, it still poses some restrictions on time, location and the amount that can be used in one sitting. These restrictions would be reduced by moving to a system of flex dollars. We propose that the total semester value of Late Meal swipes should be given to students as flex dollars. This cash credit would be valid for a semester with no restrictions on time, location or amount charged in one sitting. Students would simply debit the money from their PUIDs (as late meal currently functions). In the case of block meal plans, students could choose between options such as more dining swipes and fewer flex dollars, or fewer dining hall swipes and more flex dollars. First off, flex dollars are convenient because they do not restrict when and how much students use in a sitting. Late Meal limits students to one swipe per meal, and the cash credit cannot roll over. Thus, even if a student only utilizes one Late Meal a week, he is limited to the same $5.95 or $6.95 per meal as a student who utilizes nine a week. To take advantage of this system, many students needlessly stock up on beverages or snacks at each Late Meal. In contrast, flex dollars would allow students to get meals and snacks when they actually need them. By removing the restrictions on Late Meal, students who miss meals or study late into the night could utilize their dollars more effectively and would have an incentive to avoid wasteful practices. Flex dollars would also increase the number of locations where food could be purchased by students. In addition to the Food Gallery at Frist Campus Center, there are six campus cafes and Studio ’34, a late-night eating option. While Frist is centrally located, it is far from students studying in locations such as Forbes College or the Engineering Quadrangle. Under the new system, students would be able to use their flex dollars at locations such as the E Quad Café. Without time and location restraints, congestion in the Food Gallery would be reduced, since demand would spread out across campus. Just as flex dollars would benefit underclassmen, eating clubs can make dining more flexible and encourage community building. The Board encourages eating clubs to adopt an electronic system for meal swipes. Eating clubs allow meal exchanges with members of other eating clubs or with dining hall meal plan holders. These exchanges are extremely important because they allow upperclassmen to stay in touch with friends, to get to know underclassmen and to remain connected to the Princeton community. However, the current system of meal exchanges largely takes place through physical forms that are filled out by members and then processed by each club or dining hall. Furthermore, since the current system fines students who don’t complete their exchanges within the calendar month, this deters many from taking full advantage of their meal exchanges. An electronic meal swipe system would streamline the process, allowing members to meal exchange more easily and keep track of their exchanges. A per-semester, rather than month-based, system would remove restraints and give students more opportunities to take advantage of this system. Therefore, by removing some existing restraints on Late Meal and eating club dining options, students will have more flexibility in deciding when and where to eat. With more opportunities to interact with other students, this flexibility ultimately benefits community building at the University.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The board answers only to its Chair, the Opinion Editor and the Editor-in-Chief. 
71445|~|Stop and smell the autumn|~|   October 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|The evening I first stepped down from the Dinky was the coldest March day of my senior year of high school. I did not believe in love at first sight before that footstep, but soon I was meeting students so extraordinary and standing by castles so magnificent that I didn’t notice my own shivering. By the time I boarded a bus to New York that next afternoon, Princeton was my favorite place in the world. “If I can go here,” I thought, “I’ll be so happy.” We fantasizers all remember our ecstasy when we learned this wonderland had been promised to us. For me, that surge of disbelieving joy came two days after my visit, when decision letters went live online. Five months later, when my Outdoor Action bus rounded the corner onto Nassau Street, I felt ten solid minutes of rapture. I’m still happy. But, six weeks into my freshman fall, my delight is already fading. The magical dining halls I knew on week one have turned into cafeterias. I’ve stopped marveling at the lavish architecture and started frowning at the cracks in sidewalks. I joined The Daily Princetonian to have a soapbox to dissent from. Those things that in March I thought would be fountains of eternal happiness have been reduced to the mundane backdrops of my life. In psychology, this phenomenon is known as the hedonic treadmill: most people return to a stable level of happiness after intensely positive or negative life changes. In other words, we have to keep running to stay at the same place, but, because we’ve been running our whole lives, we don’t notice it. Overwhelmingly, study subjects overestimate the happiness that a future event will bring them. Psychologist Daniel Gilbert, who graduated from the University with a Ph.D. in social psychology in 1985, calls this the impact bias. In his Ted Talk on the subject, Gilbert draws data from a study of quadriplegics and lottery winners. Compared to lottery winners, the quadriplegic group found more joy in everyday life, and, a year post limb-loss, they were just as happy as lottery winners 12 months out from their jackpot. I feel like I won a lottery last March, and I don’t want to keep falling into the same trap that snared the study’s participants. For the remainder of this column, then, I’ve decided to step back from criticism and sing about the wondrous parts of this University rather than its rare shortfalls. Here are some things I love: I love the squirrels. They’re cute and fat, and they spazz out if you try to chase them. I love how beautiful the trees turn in the autumn. I get really happy when I catch a leaf that is falling from a tree, and I treasure the sound and the smell of the leaves that are crumbling beneath my feet. I love the roar of the Fountain of Freedom in front of Robertson Hall and the imposing aura of the zodiac sculptures. For that matter, I like all the statues. I especially like the grass, and how much there is of it here. I love the courtyards and the gorgeous gothic buildings they’re attached to. I admire the ivy that crawls up those buildings. I love my residential college, and I love its food. I love that the dining hall workers are so friendly. One smiles when she sees me and calls out to me by name, and this always makes my day better. I’m grateful that I can eat ice cream or frozen yogurt after every meal. I love that my college invites me to dinners with accomplished professors and alumni. I love my own professors, with their passion for their discipline and their commitment to their students. I love learning. I really like free movies on the weekends. Most of all, I love my peers. I love my Residential College Adviser, his snacks and all my friends in my zee group. I love my OA friends, my seminar friends, my dining hall friends and really just about everyone. I have each and every one of you to thank for making Princeton the dreamland that it is. Come, escape this treadmill with me: What do you love about Princeton?|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn. He can be reached at newby@princeton.edu. 
71423|~|Hillel International’s 'red lines' on Israel are the real problem|~|   October 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Lily Gellman  I actually have met Slav Leibin. We’ve conversed extensively in English and Hebrew, and he’s a great guy. As Tehila Wenger observes in her op-ed, Leibin was only doing his job when he pointed out that the Center for Jewish Life bars Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions at its gates. Leibin is not the problem here, Max Weiss is not the problem and the CJL is not the problem; Hillel International’s Israel policy is. Hillel used to be welcoming in its policies to all Jews, and not just to Zionists. Two weeks ago, I attended the Open Hillel conference, a historic nexus of dialogue unhampered by Hillel’s “red lines” on what Jews are free to discuss. At one of the workshops there, I learned that Hillel took no stand on Zionism when it was founded, and not even for years after the State of Israel was founded. Hillel’s function was simply to be there for Jewish students — as a place to celebrate Shabbat and the holidays — and as a haven from anti-Semitism. In the 1950s and early 1960s, for instance, Harvard Zionists was a totally separate organization from Harvard Hillel. According to conference organizer Lex Rofes, it wasn’t until the 1967 War that Hillel and other Jewish organizations manufactured Zionism as a Jewish consensus, and even then, Hillel did not yet espouse “Israel advocacy” as part of its written platform. 2010 is actually the year that brought about Hillel’s current “Standards of Partnership,” which bar not only speakers who support BDS but also anyone demonstrating “a pattern of disruptive behavior toward [Hillel] campus events” or threatening to “demonize, delegitimize or apply a double standard to Israel.” If these guidelines — these red lines — sound vague to you, that’s because they are intentionally so. Thanks to the magical “3 Ds” of Natan Sharansky, executive chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, Hillel has wiggle room to construe anything it wants as an attack on Israel unfit for sponsorship. Back at Princeton’s CJL, which is emblematic of Hillel’s surface-level “pluralism,” Wenger suggests that we do a fine job of representing “a broad spectrum of positions.” She cites as an example the CJL approving Ghaith al-Omari of the American Task Force on Palestine to speak on the Gaza panel it is co-sponsoring. But this is misleading. He might make an interesting addition to the panel, but his affiliations reveal that he does not broaden the panel’s spectrum of opinions. It is well documented that ATFP has accepted thousands of dollars in funding from the virulently Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian Klarman Family Foundation. The organization also associates closely with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a right-wing Israel lobby that Hillel partnered itself with last year. If Wenger had exercised due diligence, she might have known this. She (and Rabbi Julie Roth in the CJL’s response to Weiss’s initial piece, for that matter) also might have known that the academic boycott that the American Studies Association calls for is not “a boycott of Israeli professors” generally. It is only a boycott of the institutions themselves complicit in the occupation. Just to make that totally clear, I’m going to quote from the ASA academic boycott resolution’s FAQ section: “[Q:] Would Israeli scholars be … invited to my campus to speak in general, even if they relied on Israeli university funding? [A:] Yes. This boycott targets institutions and their representatives, not individual scholars, students or cultural workers.” The alleged “crowning irony” that Wenger attributes to Weiss’s position falls apart somewhat. Roth and Wenger also choose to ignore that the ASA boycott is a response to a broad call from Palestinian civil society to act in solidarity as the United States continues to bankroll Israel’s military with billions of dollars. Let’s also remember that backing Israeli government institutions comes at the expense of Palestinian’s academic freedom and reinforces Israel’s ongoing settler-colonialism. Academics like Israeli-British scholar Oren Ben-Dor argue this very point. People concerned about academic freedom in Israel-Palestine should note that Palestinian universities get bombed, scholars get deported and sometimes killed, their access to opportunities gets curtailed by arbitrary permits and they cannot fly to conferences from the airport in Tel Aviv. This is why we need to open our Hillel and every Hillel — so we can talk about these issues. As the most effective means of non-violent resistance that Palestinians have left, BDS is deserving of Jewish discussion. Opinions on the far right also deserve to be discussed in Hillel’s spaces. The CJL named its forthcoming panel “The Way Forward After Gaza.” One way forward for American Jews will be to stop with the pro-Israel versus anti-Israel dichotomy that Hillel encourages. I serve on the board of the Princeton Committee on Palestine, and I am also co-president of LGBTQ*J and a soprano in Koleinu (Jewish a cappella). I have lived in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for four years of my life, and I love Israel. I am Jewish and pro-Israel and pro-Palestine and pro-BDS. This is not a contradiction in terms, as much as Hillel would like you to think so. Open Hillel, and the beautiful academic freedom that comes with it, will keep campaigning. All the way back in 2007, Roth told New Jersey Jewish News, “I think the time when the Jewish community insisted on speaking with only one voice has passed.” I couldn’t agree more.

71220|~|Problems in sexual misconduct policy largely lie beyond Princeton|~|   October 21 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|This past week, there was yet another complaint about college sexual misconduct policy, this time at Harvard. After Harvard announced a new sexual misconduct policy, one that looks more or less like Princeton’s, a group of 28 Harvard Law School faculty submitted a statement decrying the changes as doing “more harm than good.” To me, the most interesting part of the letter, whether or not you agree with its view that the new policy denies due process to the accused, is that the faculty is mistakenly placing the blame on Harvard administrators. In fact, it highlights the broader problem of a too narrow focus when discussing sexual misconduct policy. Too often we focus solely on policy at the university level, which, while important, should not be completely detached from a larger discussion of much needed state and national policy reforms in this area. The Harvard Law School faculty should be taking up their concerns with the federal government by bringing the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights’ interpretation of Title IX before a federal court. Harvard’s changes are in accordance with new mandates from the OCR, just as Princeton’s are, including switching to a preponderance of evidence standard to punish the accused. Like Princeton and other colleges, Harvard faces the threat of losing all federal funding if it doesn’t make these mandated changes. The professors say that the changes “are in no way required by Title IX law or regulation,” but they fail to include that legally only the OCR has the right to interpret Title IX and that according to the OCR interpretation, Harvard has to make the proposed changes or risk losing federal funding. Granted, the statement acknowledges that “large amounts of federal funding may ultimately be at stake,” though the authors make it seem like losing this funding is a feasible alternative to following the OCR mandate. While technically Harvard’s endowment certainly could cover this huge loss of federal funding, it’s an extremely unpopular and unlikely solution, which the professors know Harvard and its peers are not inclined to do. The Harvard letter is but one instance that shows that while we should be discussing and debating sexual misconduct policy on the campus level, this cannot be done without also considering policy on a larger scale. Our federal government dictated these new policies because colleges in general were not fairly handling these cases and neither was our criminal justice system. Given that they are felonies, cases of sexual assault should be largely handled by the criminal justice system if it was actually able to better handle sexual assault. I’ve had a lot of different conversations about the University’s new policy. While there is much disagreement over the ideal policy, I’ve generally come across a consensus that ultimately society needs to change, adapt and fix how the criminal justice system handles sexual assault more broadly. Personally, I believe that the two largest problems in prosecuting sexual crimes are the treatment of victims during evidence gathering and misconceptions by many adults, particularly older adults, regarding the type of sexual assault and rape that tends to occur on college campuses. The first issue is fixable if the motivation is there. The second is more complex, as I think there is often a generational gap to understanding rape. From my experiences talking with family friends, I gather that a lot of adults imagine rape as a crime involving coercion of the victim by a stranger with a gun or knife and resulting in physical bruises, cuts or threats of such harm. And those of us in college realize that there are so many other stories of sexual assault that are just as horrific and need justice too. This is why juries, often made up of people in older generations, tend not to convict in these types of cases, like in the Dartmouth trial last year. While one option is to wait until younger generations make up the majority of juries, we should not have to wait that long for justice. Adopting clearer legal definitions of consent and therefore rape as no affirmative consent or coerced consent is the foundation to fairer prosecutions that hopefully will lead juries, no matter the age composition, to make the right decisions as society shifts its understanding of consent and rape. We’ve moved beyond an understanding of consent as “no means no” and are thankfully beginning to understand why, due to the prescriptive gender norms we are socialized with, we need an affirmative “yes means yes” consent standard. The California affirmative consent bill and the proposed New York ones are great starts to institutionalizing this progressive understanding of consent. Granted, real change, federally, statewide and then by universities is much more complex than what can be stated in an opinion column and is easier said than done. There are issues, like defining incapacity to consent, which will still complicate the situation. Nonetheless, I think it’s imperative to make sure that any conversation about sexual assault policy considers discussion both on the new university policies and on the much needed short- and long-term changes required within our criminal justice system.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

71218|~|Reporting: Is it for you or society?|~|   October 21 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|With the revamping of its sexual harassment policy, the University has approved changes to how it investigates sexual assault on campus. In many instances, students, faculty and administrators have stood up in town hall meetings, committee hearings and in writing to discuss these policy change recommendations. The participants in these discussions often bring up the topic of a victim’s choice to report. When this topic arises, debate seems to attend more to the ethics and societal responsibility of reporting, rather than the personal impact the process of reporting may have on the victim. When a victim reports a sexual harassment case, they enter the situation into the formal record of the authorities, whether the “authorities” are the school administration or the police. If a victim reports to the police, the accused could be listed in a public record of arrests, or eventually, sex offenders. If the victim reports to the University and the accused is convicted, the offense will remain on the accused’s private disciplinary record. Therefore, reporting is often considered a way to protect other members of a community from harassment. It’s why convicted sexual offenders are reported on publicly available registries and why news publications find it necessary and appropriate to disclose the identifying information of people who are possible threats within their readers’ vicinity. The idea of reporting as a social responsibility is often used as the argument to convince victims to report their cases and disclose the identities of their assailants to appropriate officials. This isn’t to say that I think that victims of sexual assault shouldn’t report their cases (after all, reporting early really can help other people and prevent them from going through the same thing). However, when a victim approaches you in confidence, using phrases such as “do it for your classmates” or even “you should stand up for your gender” — something I’ve heard far too often — doesn’t create a safe environment for the victim. Instead, it pressures the person, who’s most likely already struggling to understand and recover from a terribly unjust experience, into something that might hinder their recovery. If a friend tells you about their sexual assault, immediately responding with “why haven’t you reported it yet?” makes the victim feel as if they have done something wrong. While in the context of reporting sooner is better, the conversation on reporting needs to take into account the readiness of the victim. We need to acknowledge that the reporting process can be just as traumatic for the victim as going through sexual harassment or assault. Reporting involves asking the victim not only to remember and retell the details of the experience but also to convince someone else that something terrible really did happen to them. If a victim knows that they live in a culture where people might minimize their pain and second-guess their facts, the decision to report can come at a risk to their health and sanity. While I do believe there is a certain amount of responsibility to report, that victim deserves to have their experience acknowledged with respect and sensitivity. Furthermore, deciding on behalf of victims that being sexually harassed automatically translates into being responsible for taking the assailant to justice is taking away personal agency from victims. After all, when an individual goes through something like sexual harassment or assault, they may feel like something has been taken away from them — their voice and their will. The act of reporting should give something back to that individual; it should be empowering. The only way we can do that is if the culture of reporting shifts from just being “justice for society” to emphasizing “justice for the victim,” lest we subject them to a secondary victimization. Community responsibility certainly is a noble virtue — one that every institution should commit to, if possible — but its definition does not include or demand that individuals lose their rights for the sake of others. Rather, it incorporates individual rights into its broader context — something that we should all remember the next time a fellow student approaches us with something incredibly sensitive and personal. The dialogue should not be that the victim “owes” it to society to disclose that information. Rather, society owes it to the victim not to have them experience that kind of inhumane trauma. We need to start removing pressure and blame from the victim and reassigning responsibility to the assailants and the culture that allowed this type of behavior to exist.|~|Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major from Irvine, Calif.

71227|~|On bike theft|~|   October 21 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Coy Ozias|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Weaving in and out of pedestrians, jumping the curbs and flying down hills, I was making my way from Rockefeller College to Jadwin Gymnasium in record time. I’m obsessed with time and efficiency, and I found that by riding my bike, I could make it to wrestling practice 15 minutes faster. Overall, my bike was going to save me close to an hour of walking every day. It was the first significant thing I had ever bought with my own hard-earned money, and I had planned to have it ferry me around campus for the next four years. I purchased my bike at 4 p.m. and by 5:30 p.m. that day it was gone. After I bought my bike, I rushed it over to the Friend Center and laid it against a bike rack. Thirty minutes later, I walked out, and it was nowhere to be found. I couldn’t believe it. In my excitement, I hadn’t had time to buy a lock, and someone capitalized on my mistake. Never before had I been so angry and so disgusted. Being from a small, southern town, my family had never locked our house or cars, let alone bikes. My brother still leaves his keys in the ignition when he is away from his car! But when I walked out of the Friend Center, my innocence was shattered. My immediate reaction was one of anger and a desire for retribution, but I came to realize that committing injustice is worse than suffering injustice, and the worst injustice is the one that goes unpunished. The number one crime at the University and other college campuses around the country is theft. What does a bike thief look like? I envisioned it was the sketchy looking guy with a hoodie skulking around in an alley, but what I have come to discover is that it can be anybody. Since my bike was stolen, many students have admitted to me that they themselves have stolen bikes on campus. They seem to think it is just part of a game in which they borrow a bike, ride it for a few days and then someone else steals it. It’s not a big deal to them because so many other students steal bikes, and no one gets caught. But it’s not a game. I bet none of these people would walk into a convenience store and hold up the cashier for $1,000. They would never dream of shoplifting merchandise worth upwards of $500. But they do think it is OK to steal an expensive bike. This is likely because they think they will not be caught or experience the consequences of their actions. In Plato’s ”Gorgias,” Socrates claims that committing injustice is far worse than suffering injustice. He states, “One who’s unjust and corrupt is miserable.” While this comparison may be hard to grasp, Socrates contends that committing injustice is uglier than suffering injustice. Therefore, if it is uglier to commit injustice, it follows that it exceeds suffering injustice in either pain or badness. So by exceeding it in badness, it follows that committing injustice is worse than suffering it. Finally, Plato argues that if one is given a just punishment for his actions, good things are done unto him. Therefore, “One becomes better in the soul if he is justly disciplined.” Relating this to present times, thieves may be motivated to steal bikes because they think they will not be punished. But this is what makes it so morally devastating for the thief. Thieves by definition are thoroughly miserable and even more so if they are not given a chance to accept the just punishments for their actions. While this may not immediately manifest itself in the thief’s temperament, he has disrupted his moral fabric and is beginning to move down an immoral, miserable path. This creates a cycle of bad behavior that may result in more significant consequences in the future. So I urge you, if your bike is stolen, do not give in to the vicious cycle and steal another bike as retribution. Take comfort in knowing that you are retaining your moral righteousness and are continuing down the path of good behavior and happiness. And to all the bike thieves out there, give it up; stop stealing and return bikes.|~|Coy Ozias is a freshman from Christiansburg, Va. He can be reached at cozias@princeton.edu. 
71206|~|Is Professor Weiss suppressing Israeli academia?|~|   October 20 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Professor Max Weiss has never met Slav Leibin. Obviously. If he had, he would have understood that Leibin, the Jewish Agency Israel fellow at the University’s Center for Jewish Life, was acting in a purely advisory capacity when he pointed out that Weiss’s support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is at odds with the CJL’s Israel policy. He would know that Leibin does not “patrol” or “police” the CJL’s Israel-related programs but works with a diverse body of students who bring their own positions and convictions to bear on the coordination of these events. He would have walked into the tiny office on the second floor of the CJL building (if Leibin’s there, the door’s open) and started a civil conversation about Hillel policy instead of writing an op-ed that attacks someone he has never met for failing to invite him — a decision he seems to equate with banning, barring and silencing — to a panel about Israel’s recent operation in Gaza. As the CJL response points out, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement that Weiss supports calls for a “cultural and academic boycott of Israeli professors and institutions of higher learning.” This is the crowning irony of Weiss’s impassioned defense of free speech on campus: The position he wants to represent before the Princeton community is one that openly and intentionally marginalizes Israeli academia. As an expert in the modern Middle East, he must know that universities are the liberal bastions of Israeli society where some of the most influential voices calling for peace and the most strident critics of the Israeli government reside. How can he reasonably accuse the CJL of stifling free speech when the movement he supports is one that indiscriminately targets Israeli academia, thereby delegitimizing and repressing some of the most influential institutions working for change in Israel? Weiss repeatedly emphasizes the need for a “free and full exchange of ideas and opinions” at the University in his op-ed. He has somehow rationalized the hypocrisy of defending his “right” to be sponsored by the CJL while simultaneously championing a movement that attempts to repress the free and full exchange of ideas in the international academic scene. I wish he had shared that rationalization in his column. In his column last week, Ben Dinovelli argued that the CJL has a moral obligation to create a forum where Weiss can air his views. He implied that by excluding Weiss, the CJL is limiting the Gaza panel to the “Israeli perspective.” Equating Weiss with all that is not pro-Israel is extremely misleading. The broad spectrum of positions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict includes many experts and activists who do not represent the Israeli perspective or support BDS; take Ghaith al-Omari, the executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine, who will be featured on the Nov. 4 panel that Weiss was not asked to join. It is important to note that the CJL and its affiliate student groups’ reluctance to engage with certain positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict extends to both sides of the political spectrum. Samuel Major ’16, president of Tigers for Israel, told me that under his leadership, the student group would not sponsor an event that hosted a Zionist speaker opposed to a two-state solution. This is not a moral failing on TFI’s part. The group recognizes that extremism does not create successful dialogue or change. For the CJL and many of the Princeton students organizing the panel on Gaza, any movement that aims to bypass discourse with economic, cultural and academic strong-arm delegitimation tactics is extreme. Weiss, while the CJL will not hand you a soapbox for the dissemination of ideas that are fundamentally opposed to its support for, well, free speech, I know for a fact that you are welcome to discuss your views with students and staff of all political persuasions who frequent the center any time the fancy takes you. There’s this guy who works there, one of the most thoughtful, open and respectful individuals I know, who would be particularly happy to meet with you in order to clarify both his role at the CJL and broader Hillel Israel policy. His name is Slav Leibin.  |~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio. She can be reached at twenger@princeton.edu. 
71104|~|Yak uncaged|~|   October 19 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Want to be able to chat with other students at Princeton? There’s an app for that. Want to parody these students at Princeton? There’s a yak for that. Yik Yak, the newest location-based social networking app, has taken colleges (and high schools) across the country by storm. It provides a chat room for users within a 1.5-mile radius. The latest social media fad, the app displays short, 200-character posts from local users. Users can “yak” — or post — as well as comment and upvote or downvote other posts. But what makes Yik Yak so distinctly different from apps such as Twitter? Anonymity. No name, no age, no social security number needed. You just download the app from the App Store and you’re almost instantaneously ready to become the new Yakmeister. After all, a large part of why people yak is to garner widespread fame, popularity and, well, street cred. Make it consecutively to the hottest Yaks and you’ll find that even your RCA will be quoting your Yak, as my friend Anyssa Chebbi ’18 animatedly pointed out. Yaks can be about any variety of topics. Popular themes include mocking Forbes, mocking Harvard and Yale, mocking people passing by on the Street and, from time to time, mocking your friends. Certainly, a good number of posts on Yik Yak are not mocking but are in fact witty, hilarious and even crudely humorous. But a good number of posts are indeed mocking, and even offensive. From racism, often in the form of racial microaggressions, to homophobia to cyberbullying and death threats, this new trend has its dangers. These can be attributed to the anonymous nature of the app, which raises concern. With Facebook and Twitter, it’s possible to link a post or tweet with a particular profile or account. But on Yik Yak, no such possibility exists, ultimately instigating and facilitating hate and bullying, even if the Yakker was just trying to be funny. Anonymity provides people with a guise and even refuge from direct attack by an audience by allowing them to post freely and often rashly. It gives people the impression that their words will have no social consequences; hence, they can make bigoted posts without having to consider who that post will inevitably hurt or offend. According to a study cited in the Economist, “anonymity frees people ‘from traditionally constraining pressures of society, conscience, morality and ethics to behave in a normative manner.’” This ultimately contributes to a culture of insensitivity and bullying. If we have the temerity to post such comments, then we should do so without the guise of anonymity, as we do on a plethora of other social media sites. We should be willing and ready to face the repercussions of what we say. That being said, Yik Yak serves as a great venue for some comic relief. Yakmeisters and Yak-amateurs provide users with funny, all-too-relatable observations and pearls of wisdom while climbing the ranks of the social media hierarchy. Plus, the anonymity allows them to say what they want without fear of castigation or ostracizement. Nonetheless, Yik Yak is a double-edged sword. As my friend Chance Fletcher ’18 pointed out, “I think that Yik Yak is great, but it is wrong if someone uses its mask as a way to say hurtful things that could upset someone; of course it may be funny, but it isn’t funny if someone is being bullied or hurt, and people need to realize the possible effects on others before posting a Yak.” Even with the interminably growing popularity of Yik Yak on campus, Undergraduate Student Government is planning an anti-cyberbullying initiative, in light of recent controversy with the app. Paradoxically, people took to Yik Yak to denigrate USG with Yaks like “USG goes to bed at 9.” The solution seems extraordinarily easy to me: think before you Yak, and Yak at others as you’d like to be Yakked at. And don’t consider anonymity an excuse to cyberbully. If you wouldn’t normally dare to tweet what you’re considering Yakking, then don’t Yak it. Yaks come and go, but the (Yak)arma lives on.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz. She can be reached at ssakha@princeton.edu. 
71072|~|Are we here to make money?|~|   October 19 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Julia Case-Levine|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“Everyone’s here to make money,” an upperclassman, nonchalantly chowing down on a Late Meal quesadilla, declared to me the first Thursday of freshman week, “Premeds want to make money. Engineers want to make money. And, of course, econ kids want to make bucket loads of money.” A murmuring of approval from our table at Frist Campus Center accompanied this assertion. And even though his candor was startling, I nodded along. The facts certainly seem to support his hypothesis; the most popular degree at the University is, indeed, economics. Courses like ECO 100: Introduction to Macroeconomics and COS 126: General Computer Science, classes many students feel will have practical applications in the job market, attract over 300 students. And why shouldn’t students expect their hard work at the University to have a monetary pay-off? College is an expensive investment; as my microeconomics professor might say, there’s a high opportunity cost for pursuing a degree without a stable economic future. Besides, the University isn’t alone in this trend: even at Brown, which many consider the Ivy League haven for alternative thought, 17% of the graduating class of 2013 chose to concentrate in some form of economics. Additionally, the ability to make more money was listed by 81% of students as an important reason to attend college in 2012, an all-time national high. In recent years anxiety about post-graduation employment has surged due to an increasingly challenging job market provoked by the 2008 financial crisis. Is it time to hammer down on those math textbooks and turn to job markets we know have stability, stamina and space for newcomers? Or do we still have the luxury to ask existential questions when selecting our careers, or pursue degrees solely for the pleasure of the study? I think so. And the University seems to agree. For those unfamiliar with this year’s freshman summer reading book, the University made a pretty bold choice — a 143 page philosophical lecture titled, “Meaning in Life and Why it Matters,” by Susan Wolf, a philosophy professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The premise can be summed up simply: engage in projects of objective worth. Wolf would advise students to consider finding a passion that in some way promotes the well-being of those outside of one-self. The University’s decision to assign Wolf’s inspection of meaning to every incoming freshman points to the institution’s intent to challenge cultural norms that prioritize money making. This is a valiant effort. Recent financial history brands our obsession with wealth as particularly alarming. The 2008 financial crisis was a product of, among many other factors, greed. The University, in order to live up to its claim to be “in the Nation’s service” has a responsibility to equip students with the courage to explore passions independent of pure financial gain. Now, I don’t believe you have to dedicate your life to spoon-feeding every impoverished orphan to live a full life, but I do wonder when “making bucket loads of money” became synonymous with success and gained stature as a kosher, even celebrated, career goal. Maybe valuing money for money’s sake is deeply ingrained in our culture, but maybe there’s also room during these four years to explore what else interests and engages us. We don’t all have to be Mother Teresa or volunteer for every community outreach program. But from a purely selfish standpoint, we owe it to ourselves to explore passions that fulfill and enrich us. The big secret is that we’re already here. We’re the truly lucky ones because we have the luxury to not only find jobs that support us financially but also deeply interest us. It’s actually those impoverished orphans (the ones you’re not spoon-feeding) that have to spend their lives obsessed with making money. At the best university in the country we have the luxury to explore, wander and actively hunt for what captivates us. We can be comforted by the knowledge that once we have found our passion, career opportunities abound. One of the biggest the pay-offs of going to the University isn’t that it offers a route to get rich quick, but that it affords the opportunity to think a little, to get introspective and maybe read a little Susan Wolf, before we determine how we’re going to approach our futures.|~|Julia Case-Levine is a freshman from New York, N.Y.

71073|~|Editorial: Reform language course policies |~|   October 19 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Among Princeton’s general education requirements is foreign language proficiency, which, according to Office of the Dean of the College, encourages students to “become literate in another culture and gain another perspective on the world.” Though the A.B. minimum requirement calls for the completion of a beginner’s language track (three or four courses up to the 107/108 level) or the demonstration of proficiency via Advanced Placement, SAT Subject or departmental placement tests, many students go beyond the minimum requirement by pursuing additional languages at Princeton. These ambitious students, however, face significant disincentives to their budding polyglotism: students cannot take most beginner’s language courses on a pass/D/fail basis, and the University does not give credit for taking a 101-level language class without the subsequent 102-level course. These two barriers counter the intellectual spirit of Princeton. All students should be able to receive credit for 101-level language classes, and, as the Board has previously advocated, students who have already completed their language requirement should be able to take introductory level language courses on a P/D/F basis. The language requirement is distinct from other distributional areas in that it requires not mere passing but proficiency in a language, a standard above the norm of distributional requirements. This idea extends into the day-to-day classroom sphere as well: since initial language learning is a skill that requires significant and continued effort, the graded basis of introductory language courses adds additional incentive and motive for students to keep pace with the course and reach the same end goal of proficiency. This effort is noticeable in the small setting of introductory language classes. Capped at 12 students per section, these five-day-a-week classes can easily become slowed down when one student fails to be prepared, adversely impacting the remaining students. This can create a perpetual cycle: students who fail to prepare are less likely to speak out in class for fear of embarrassment and will continue to fall behind. However, those who have already attained proficiency or mastery of a second language fall beyond the scope of these worries. The student wishing to begin an additional language does so out of pure intellectual curiosity and commitment (or, granted to fulfill departmental prerequisites or requirements, in which case the course must be taken for a grade anyway, and is thus beyond the scope of this policy change). Only students with this motivation would choose to take generally difficult classes that meet every weekday; thus the motivation of these students implies they will commit the effort necessary to learn the new language. Moreover, the ability to take the course on a P/D/F basis encourages their classroom participation. Without the fear of being graded on the letter scale, students are more likely to try things in class and are more likely to let themselves fail, an important part of any language learning process. Moreover, credit for 101-level courses would greatly incentivize this process of trying and intellectual curiosity. These language courses are significant enough, both in terms of time commitment, in and out of the classroom, and difficulty, especially for students who have yet to attain language proficiency, that giving credit for these courses is justified. However, the refusal to give credit for the 101-level course makes the choice of language overly significant. If a student begins a language but finds after the 101-level that the choice was wrong and thus does not continue with the language, that semester of effort and learning is disregarded. Forcing that student to continue to the 102-level just to receive a semester’s worth of already-earned credit would ultimately dampen the discussion: that student is all but guaranteed to dislike the class. However, to give credit for 101-level language courses is to allow intellectually curious students to try new languages without the fear of wasting a course. Students can try new languages, and if they decide that their choice was wrong, they can bow out gracefully. Multilingualism helps students further develop skills necessary to have a global perspective. Even brief exposure to other languages has tangible benefits for students in all disciplines to improve this perspective. Consequently, a student’s quest for increased exposure to foreign languages should not be hampered. By removing the no-credit policy for 101-level language courses and the P/D/F restrictions imposed on most language courses for students who have already demonstrated second-language proficiency, the University will support students who strive to be “in the service of all nations.” Dissent While credit should be awarded on a per-semester basis, allowing students to P/D/F language courses hinders learning for other students. The P/D/F option will decrease a student’s motivation to prepare for classes regularly and consistently. Sure, it can be argued that students who take courses past the language requirement are motivated and curious. However, since it’s natural for P/D/F courses to be a low priority, even intellectually motivated students can fall behind when their workload is heavy or when they have extra-curricular commitments. In classes such as Elementary Chinese, the graded weekly quizzes and tests ensure that students regularly review and prepare. Without the pressure from feeling the impact of these grades, students would be less incentivized to study rigorously. Since these small language classes are interactive by nature, a student’s lack of preparedness can affect the learning of other students. When some students are unprepared to answer questions, it slows down the class and prevents the instructor from quickly moving through new material. In a short 50-minute session, every minute counts. Besides, it benefits these intellectually curious students to take graded classes since language courses are very different from other P/D/F-able courses where one can catch up on the work at a later time or skim readings. To really work toward proficiency, students must make a consistent effort. The current grading system encourages this.

70948|~|To freeze or not to freeze in Silicon Valley |~|   October 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|Google has its ball pits and nap pods, but Apple and Facebook may have taken the lead when it comes to perks — if you’re a woman, that is. On Tuesday, NBC News reported that the two companies now offer coverage for their female employees to have their eggs frozen. The move seems a direct response to the heavily debated work-life balance concerns of professional women. With that balance proving to be more of a doomed juggling act for women who are equally devoted to career and family within today’s inflexible work culture, the new benefit could be a welcome alternative to these concurrent pressures. Young women will now have the opportunity to postpone pregnancy in order to focus exclusively on establishing their careers without the increased risk of infertility later on — a measure that was certainly out of reach for some, if not most, as the procedure can cost upwards of $10,000, according to NBC News. While I commend these technology giants for making this unprecedented move, the coverage has some, including Lauren Barbato of the news site Bustle, asking that hotly contested question, “Can women have it all?”  At best, the offer suggests that women can indeed have it all — meaning career and family — just not all at once. Put less generously, however, the answer is a more simple “no.” The suggestion here is that a childless young woman is a more valuable asset to a company. One can certainly be a mother, the policy seems to suggest, but only after she spends her 20s and 30s focused on her career, and her career alone. Anne-Marie Slaughter ’80 argues, in her now famous — or infamous, depending who you speak with, — article in The Atlantic, that a woman should be able to have a family and a career simultaneously if she so desires, but that the current reality is not conducive to such a balance. In fact, Slaughter explicitly suggests that a woman navigating today’s deeply flawed workplace is best off establishing herself in her career first and foremost, but still planning to have kids prior to 35, “or else freeze [her] eggs, whether [she is] married or not.” Nonetheless, this advice to freeze one’s eggs is limited to a minority of women due to the economic constraints of such a costly procedure. In this light, Facebook and Apple have now made Slaughter’s recommendation far more accessible. Thus, I would posit that Slaughter might appreciate the policy. However, like myself, she might ask, “Can’t they do more?” Freezing one’s eggs is a fine option within the context of today’s work culture, but it does not actually change that culture, which should be the ultimate goal. Greater steps must be made by influential companies to create environments that allow for career advancement in conjunction with motherhood. Barbato noted that Facebook and Apple both have generous paid maternity leave policies, but neither grants its employees subsidized day care plans or onsite day care programs. Thus, if an older woman were to then use her previously-frozen eggs while still an employee, she faces the same concerns as a young working mother. The work-life tension has not been solved, only postponed. Even more concerning might be the implicit notion that these older women will leave the company once they have children. As most leadership roles within a company are attained in one’s 40s or 50s, after a number of working years, this could greatly affect the already low number of women in positions of corporate power. NBC News ended its article with Christy Jones, the founder of Extend Fertility, saying, “Offering this benefit ‘can help women be more productive human beings.’ ” It is this exact misconception that perpetuates an unfair perception of the working mother and makes Facebook and Apple’s policy inadequate. Productivity is far more subjective than a calculation of hours or output. A productive woman can certainly be a childless woman that arrives early to the office and then stays late. However, a productive woman can also be one that is given a schedule that allows her to sit down to dinner with her children and work from home after they’ve gone to bed.  A productive woman can be one that raises her children to be thoughtful, kind-hearted, engaged individuals while holding a leadership role within her workplace. The idea that postponing motherhood increases productivity is short-sighted and regressive. Facebook and Apple have given women greater control over the trajectory of their careers and family life, and this should most certainly be applauded. Nonetheless, I worry that their efforts are misguided. I do not suggest that the policy be revoked, but rather that it be compounded, with greater benefits for current mothers or those hoping to have children while relatively young as well. By offering subsidized or onsite day care services, flexible hours and the possibility to work from home more often, these women could be equally accommodated, and their unique talents and perspectives encouraged rather than lost.  My concern is that, in offering only the option to freeze one’s eggs, these companies will begin to unconsciously favor those women willing to do so, as if postponing motherhood is indicative of greater work ethic or dedication rather than a personal preference. This policy threatens to engender a subtle implication that a young woman cannot be successful in her career with a child at home, and those trying to strike the balance nonetheless are not serious about their careers. If the counterpoint is that these companies are simply trying to account for the difficulties of work-life balance, then the answer is not to separate the two or place them in succession, but rather to empower the working mother by offering programs that cultivate real change within today’s work culture.|~|Chelsea Jones is an English major from Ridgefield, Conn.

70906|~|Facebook, politics and internet sensationalism|~|   October 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|I am not the type of person who lives by a set of hard rules. I enjoy being spontaneous and exploring new things. That said, I have one very strict rule regarding social media. Simply put, I never post or share anything serious on social media. By serious, I mean anything pertaining to a controversial or potentially contentious issue. I never back down from commenting on a controversial Facebook post because I feel that it is necessary to challenge people’s need to share cursory and potentially sensitive information, but I am never the original poster. The topic of internet activism — or slacktivism — has been covered here many times before, criticized for being lazy and ineffective, but that’s not what I’m doing. I made this rule for myself because of two key observations that I have made about the online world. The first is that social media, like many aspects of the internet, is rarely ever a medium for constructive discourse. Rather, it is an ideological vacuum where similar people congregate and feed off of one another’s opinions, pushing opinions to polarization. The second reason is that social media is, by nature, a medium cultivated by short attention spans and instant gratification. The effort required to read or share a post is so minimal that the meaningful research necessary to have informed opinions rarely happens. Instead, faulty information that catches the eye is immediately propagated to every man, woman and child with access to a computer screen. A few months ago, I broke this rule for the first time in a while. Sitting on my couch on a Wednesday night, I decided to watch a documentary on YouTube, already a poor choice of information gathering. Without mentioning the name of the movie, it is fair to say that it prompted the exact sort of emotional rise that these types of films are meant to provoke. I was so heated that I had to get this message out to the world for people to see the truth! I fell into the trap that so many internet users fall into today, convincing myself that posting a link on Facebook would bring meaningful change. Not but one hour later, after I had cooled off, I began reading reviews of the film as well as the court cases and issues covered in the documentary. As you might expect, the issue was not as black and white as it was painted to be. I went back and checked my post to find that a friend had liked it. I immediately deleted the post and messaged him, apologizing for dragging him into political sensationalism through my momentary lapse of self-control. Tangible evidence for any argument takes extensive research and effort. The minimal-effort nature of social media makes it the perfect medium for sensationalism, political extremism and distortion of fact. Twitter goes so far as to limit a user to 140 characters. Using Twitter to pedal political ideology is the most nonsensical way of trying to influence public opinion. If you support gender equality, that is a legitimate fight to undertake. But, for God’s sake, don’t choose Twitter as your medium for change. It’s as if somebody told you to write a research paper on gender equality, but limited the final draft to the size of sticky note. An equally dangerous result of the minimal-effort nature of the internet is the spreading of faulty information. Ravie Somaiya’s article, “If a Story is Viral, Truth May be Taking a Beating,” which appeared in The New York Times in December 2013, details countless viral stories in recent years that were completely fictitious, but were shared in the name of truth because internet users don’t have the motivation to check the facts. Studies have suggested that children tend to trust written information more than spoken information. Scientists attribute this to the fact that children put so much effort into learning to read that naturally it carries a more authoritative edge. I think that written information has always had an air of validity to it purely because it traditionally required so much more effort to produce. Well, with the rapid growth of the information age, information reigns king, while truth has become extraneous. One of the best quotes I’ve heard in a while is: “The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.” The concept is an old one, but is articulated well here by programmer Alberto Brandolini, who cleverly labels this the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle. Ironically, I saw this quote on a viral image, so it’s wrong of me to discredit virality and social media altogether. Twitter serves as a great source of immediate news coverage from around the world, and some viral photos like the one I referenced above can be funny, entertaining, or even mildly informative. However, it is important to recognize the limited available information inherent to such a form of information sharing. I recognize that it is unreasonable to completely eliminate impulsive internet sharing. So instead, I’ll advocate skepticism. Next time you see a picture or story that infuriates you or excites you, resist for a moment the urge to click the like button or to retweet the link. Instead, open up a new tab and Google it, read about it, think about it for a moment more and consider the repercussions of supporting those very short 140 characters.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a computer science major from Pittsburgh, Pa.

70959|~|Editorial: Expand the Humanities Sequence|~|   October 16 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|No liberal arts education is complete without a solid grounding in the Western intellectual tradition. In the past, students were assured a rigorous foundation in the humanities via a core curriculum; today, with the core curriculum replaced by malleable distribution requirements, students who yearn to drink deeply from the Pierian Spring must cobble together their own curriculum. Fortunately for such Princetonians, each year the University offers HUM 216-217 and HUM 218-219: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Western Culture from Antiquity to the Middle Ages, commonly known as the Humanities Sequence. Unfortunately, this renowned course comes with an application and an enrollment cap. We humbly propose the application and enrollment procedure be reformed in hopes of expanding the program. The Humanities Sequence is a whirlwind year-long course of study, which plunges participating students into the depths of Western literature, art, history and philosophy. Taught by world-class professors like music professor Scott Burnham and philosophy professor Benjamin Morison, the Humanities Sequence introduces students to the greatest minds of Western Civilization, from Homer to Virgil, Augustine to Aquinas, Boethius to Dante, and everything in between. Without a doubt, the Humanities Sequence is an invaluable part of a Princeton education in the humanities. Currently, the Humanities Sequence is an opportunity available only to those who apply and gain admission to the program, even though a majority of applicants are accepted. By contrast, our Ivy League neighbor to the north, Columbia, requires that every undergraduate student study the classical texts that undergird our Western civilization through its mandatory core curriculum. Yale offers its incoming Elis the opportunity to partake in its Directed Studies program, a humanistic juggernaut akin to the University’s own Humanities Sequence. Yale’s program, however, accepts 125 students per year. That’s over two and a half times the size of our program, even though the University and Yale have comparable undergraduate populations. Given the importance of the Western tradition to the liberal arts education, the Humanities Sequence ought to expand. In years past, there have been as many as 70 applicants for the coveted 40-something spots in the course, according to the Princeton Alumni Weekly. Ideally, the Humanities Sequence would have unlimited enrollment, but this is not possible. The problem is that, unlike ordinary courses, the program cannot easily add precepts to adjust to fluctuating student demand, since its precepts are traditionally faculty-led. We believe that it is best to overestimate demand in planning precepts for the course; nevertheless, we recognize that an enrollment cap will ultimately remain necessary. The current application process could be modified, however, so as to promote student demand to take the Humanities Sequence. As things stand, there are two application deadlines for admittance into the Humanities Sequence. The first deadline is in April, well before incoming freshmen matriculate, and the second deadline arrives conveniently in the midst of the circus known as freshman week. During that disorienting orientation week, it is all too easy to miss the deadline or waffle over whether to commit two course slots in one’s schedule to the Humanities Sequence. We suggest that the first application be retained and the second abandoned, to be replaced by open enrollment. The first application, then, would effectively serve to reserve a spot in the course for incoming freshmen who apply, thus encouraging them to matriculate. With open enrollment, freshmen and sophomores would freely enroll to the limit and then shop/drop as usual. What about the students who shop only to discover that they can’t keep pace with the rigors of the Humanities Sequence? The difficulty here, particularly for freshmen in the first weeks of class, is that dropping a double-credit class leaves a doubly large void to fill. This could prove tough, especially if they were unable to shop other courses due to the Humanities Sequence’s demanding lecture-precept schedule from day one. This worry is not as acute as it may seem; such students could easily switch into HUM 205: The Classical Roots of Western Literature, commonly known as “Baby HUM,” for what should prove a more manageable workload, and then only need to select one additional class. Prospective Humanities Sequence students may also attempt the summer reading and discover that the clip of the course may be too challenging for them, and choose not to shop at all. Beyond reshaping the application and enrollment process, more could be done to stimulate student interest and demand for increased capacity of the Humanities Sequence. For instance, every year, upon notification of acceptance to the University, future Tigers receive a leaflet encouraging application to the Humanities Sequence; this leaflet could also provide prospective Princetonians with a complete syllabus, include a caveat as to the difficulty level of the course, but also encourage them to start the summer reading such that they could consider shopping the course at the start of the year. Offering this additional information may help to stoke interest and, hopefully, increase demand for the Humanities Sequence to expand in size in coming years. The University is an excellent institution to study the liberal arts, but it could still improve by allowing freshmen and sophomores to enroll in the University’s premier program of courses in the Western intellectual tradition. Humanities Sequence professor Denis Feeney expressed a hope that the program might expand to include more interested students. We share his hope.  |~|

70707|~|CJL: Freedom of speech or association? |~|   October 15 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Over half a century ago, an authoritative body tried to silence an organization’s right to associate. When the issue came before the Supreme Court, Justice John Marshall Harlan II, in a unanimous opinion, wrote, ”It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the ‘liberty’ assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” The case: NAACP v. Alabama, which pitted the pro-segregationist Alabama Attorney General John Patterson against the pro-African-American civil rights group. While it’s obviously true the University would not try the same, the classic brawl between freedom of speech and association has appeared once again. This Monday, Professor Max Weiss wrote an op-ed, titled “Is the Center for Jewish Life stifling free speech on campus?”, that has stirred controversy over the CJL’s recent refusal to allow his participation in an event on the recent Gaza conflict. While I could extol the long, historical debates on the merits of both, I won’t waste your time. As the Center for Jewish Life argued in its response, “participation in a panel that we sponsor is a privilege and not a right.” And they’re right. Several Supreme Court decisions from Kusper v. Pontikes (1973) to Boy Scouts of America v. Dale (2000), have established a legal right for organizations, like the CJL, to associate with whomever they want. However, there is a fundamental difference between what is legally required of an organization and what an organization should aspire to accomplish. Sadly, this distinction is being missed. The goal of “address[ing] the context and consequences of the Israeli assault on Gaza in July that left over 2,100 Palestinians and nearly 70 Israelis dead” is clearly a noble one. This summer exploded into a hotbed of political, military and cultural tensions displayed on the television screens of millions. For many, whose first real in-depth analysis of this issue may be through such a panel, it is essential that they get the opportunity to hear from multiple sides. Removing Weiss — or failing to offer someone representative of that side of the debate — robs the panel’s audience of that chance to properly decide for themselves what they think. Granted, there is nothing wrong with promoting a panel that offers to explain the conflict from the “Israeli” perspective, but it appears that was not the panel’s intention. Framing the debate as objective, while completely excluding one side of the argument, is a disservice both to Weiss and the University community as a whole. While no association should be forced to invite a speaker, exclusion undoubtedly runs counter to the idea of academic openness that has made the University so great before. From Fidel Castro in the 1960s to Richard Falk last spring, the inclusion of even the most disagreed-upon views can widen our perspectives. In response, several members of the CJL responded that, while open to debate, they refuse to “sponsor groups or speakers that intend to harm Israel or promote racism or hatred of any kind.” The particular petition they referenced is a boycott against Israeli academic institutions, signed by Weiss over the summer. Equating the opposition to a governmental policy with “racism” only seeks to demonize the opposition and hurt, rather than foster, debate. Such calls attempt to equate Weiss with the same bigots who attempted to silence the NAACP half a century before. Ironically, this panel would have been the perfect opportunity for people to allow these ideas to compete against each other, allowing the audience to decide whether his ideas are merited or uncalled for. It is the same First Amendment that allows the CJL to associate that has also allowed Weiss to sign on to the boycott. In a democracy, like ours, it is the promotion of such a variety of views that grants us the ability to judge each argument on its own merit. The CJL representatives concluded that “panel discussions, travel experiences, [and] ongoing dialogues […] are more likely to bring about positive change than boycotts or newspaper articles that attack those working to find common ground.” While they are undoubtedly helpful, they are not always enough. Just ask Martin Luther King Jr. If we see wrong in the world, it is up to us to speak out to it. Better to let a potential wrong be examined and dismissed than crushed before it is even heard out.|~|Ben Dinovelli is a Wilson School major from Mystic, Conn.

70721|~|Who am I writing for?|~|   October 15 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|Since last week, I’ve had to do some soul-searching to find it in me to keep writing — not because my freshman seminar professor shredded my first essay with the same rapture my five-year-old self found in making confetti, but because my one “successful” work this year didn’t directly achieve what I had hoped. By metrics of circulation, my column titled “Keep misandry out of feminism” was, in fact, a success: it sparked 154 online comments, emails from as far away as Denver, a response column by Marni Morse and a retweet by feminist author Christina Hoff Sommers to her 20,000 followers. But a truly successful opinion article should precipitate change, and this is where my article fell short. Not that I came here expecting to change campus — I didn’t. However, the outspoken resistance to new ideas from voices on all angles of the issue floored me. On one hand, dozens of men unaffiliated with the University bashed me for supporting feminism. The movement, they said, has become inseparable from misandry. Although their words underscored my argument — that feminism’s dearth of male support stems from its conflation with misandry — they betrayed a failure to consider that most feminists fight for equality. Conversely, a small number of commenters attacked me from the other side. One wrote, “the feminist movement is not defined by men,” thereby continuing to exclude half the population from a conversation that affects everyone. I am not bothered by disagreement per se. I expect it, and it’s healthy. Actually, the culture of resisting new ideas is not even unique to those who disagree. For example, Sommers praised my article because it reinforced her position in her 1994 book “Who Stole Feminism?” Had I written from a perspective that she did not already champion, I doubt she would have been so supportive — in fact, I doubt she would have read my article at all. Internet news sources are so plentiful that it is all too easy to read only those sources that confirm your viewpoints. I am especially guilty of this. In truth, I am the most guilty. Reading 154 items of feedback on my column should have given me a more nuanced view, but I too remained static in my beliefs. My stability of opinion in this conversation is probably an error. In praise of our campus community, we err less spectacularly than I have become accustomed to. Biases were so self-reinforcing in my rural southern town that my AP Biology teacher never endorsed the veracity of evolution. My grandfather took pride in never reading any book except the Bible, and my aunt eschewed bipartisan news for left-wing commentary. By contrast, the minds I have encountered here have been overwhelmingly tolerant of ideas different from their own. Why there is a breakdown between that in-flesh openness and the uncompromising firewall that my article hit, I cannot say. What I can say is that zealous resistance breaks down in intimate conversations. Perhaps the physical presence of other people forces you to consider their humanity. Perhaps the quick back-and-forth of conversation demands you evaluate the merit of what someone is saying, rather than take time to convince yourself their idea is wrong. After she published her column, Marni and I ate dinner together and found that our opinions are mostly concordant. We walked away friends. I am all but certain that I, at least, would not have been so receptive had our dialogue played out in a 750-word rant glorified as an opinion column. Besides, it would not have helped. These columns, I’ve decided, don’t do anything — not by themselves at least. They don’t change how people think unless they spark face-to-face discussions. That’s why Marni’s column was good: agree with her or not, she started a conversation. I hope that I — and my fellow ‘Prince’ writers and every other voice whose words you hear — bring about change indirectly by inviting conversation. That’s why we write. That’s why Emma Watson gives UN speeches and our colleges host dinner with guests like Anne-Marie Slaughter ’80. We don’t do this for ourselves. We don’t do it for Internet commenters. We do it for conversationalists. So show this page to someone else. If you have different reactions to something, talk about it. Your words, not mine, are the agents of change.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn. He can be reached at newby@princeton.edu. 
70724|~|Beyond the Rhetoric Part II: The Numbers Don’t Lie|~|   October 15 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Last week the Daily Princetonian published an op-ed by members of the Latino Graduate Student Association, Graduate Women of Color Caucus, and Black Graduate Caucus on the Graduate School’s recent decision to restructure the Office of Academic Affairs and Diversity and, effectively, deprioritize issues of diversity at the graduate level. While some may disagree with the tone of the article, its central premise remains: Recent changes in the organizational structure of the Graduate School significantly damage underrepresented students’ faith in the current administration’s ability to increase minority representation and improve campus climate. Persons of color are underrepresented at all levels of the Graduate School. Just last year, the Report of the Trustee Ad Hoc Committee on Diversity concluded the University was not doing all it could to create a diverse and inclusive campus climate. This is not particularly surprising when considering that only 1% of senior staff self-identify as Hispanic and 6% self-identify as black. The demographics are just as bleak among the faculty, where 2% and 4% of full professors identify as Hispanic and black, respectively. At the doctoral student level, Hispanic and black students make up about 10% of the graduate student body. The trustees’ report, however, did point to a few bright spots. One point of progress explicitly mentioned was the establishment of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Diversity position. While increasing minority representation is important, we know from the organizational diversity literature that having senior leadership connected and committed to issues pertaining to underrepresented groups is foundational for an organization committed to diversity. Eliminating this position is a decision in direct opposition to another finding of the trustees’ report, that “comprehensive and consistent strategies designed to promote diversity are harder to implement when authority is devolved among scores of academic and administrative units.” It appears as though the Graduate School is not only ignoring the voices of current graduate students but also dismissing — and fundamentally contradicting — recommendations distilled from 20 focus groups, four surveys, a comprehensive literature review, national comparative data and the more than 2,500 members of the University community who comprised the final data set for the trustees’ report. It is unreasonable for Dean of the Graduate School Sanjeev Kulkarni and the rest of the university leadership to ask students of color to trust their decisions when their actions clearly disregard recommendations endorsed by the University’s own trustees and the students who are purportedly being served by their efforts. Yet the development of a welcoming and inclusive institution extends beyond increasing representation and organizational structure. Among other experiences, minority students at Princeton have reported receiving less attention from advisers, being perceived as less competent than their peers, having their work devalued and being reduced to racial stereotypes. In addition, students at Princeton have experienced overt racism — e.g., being the target of racial slurs or accused of stealing bikes when unlocking one’s own bike — which further reduce their feelings of incorporation into the University community. With the release of last week’s article, it is still evident that these experiences of underrepresented graduate students continue to be largely hidden from view. Certainly, part of this is related to representation. Since minority students still constitute a small proportion in most departments, it is difficult to anonymize these experiences in ways that make students feel comfortable to share. To begin to assess these issues in a systematic way, the Graduate School should compile sorely needed data on minority experiences at Princeton and disseminate it to the University community in a way that respects the vulnerable positions of underrepresented graduate students, staff and faculty. The effort would not only help senior leadership be able to better serve these groups but also reflect a willingness to understand — ultimately rebuilding students’ trust. While many of these issues will continue to be a part of the graduate school experience at the University, we had a strong advocate in the Office of Diversity under the leadership of an associate dean who was dedicated to improving both representation and conditions for minority students. We hope the Graduate School will work with us in ensuring that these previous commitments and priorities are not forgotten but rather expanded. Ultimately, we, as students of color, want what we are promised every time the University says it is committed to advancing diversity. We hope that as we move forward, that commitment becomes unequivocally clear in real and tangible ways, because it is certainly not what we are currently seeing or experiencing.

70595|~|The suicide of the humanities |~|   October 14 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Logan Sander|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I recently received an email with the best of intentions — one announcing a workshop for information on career options. The notification that popped up on my phone had the subject line: “Major Choices: What Arts and Humanities Are Good For.” Of course, this seems like such a great endorsement of the arts and humanities and an encouragement for the fields … until you realize it implies that most people would need this workshop in order to know what the arts and humanities are actually good for. So many people — including humanities majors themselves — are buzzing about the “death of the humanities,” but that in and of itself is the problem. Why are we pegging the humanities as dying? Why are people in the humanities fields lamenting a death that, in perspective of what the humanities aim for, isn’t really happening? There a few facts we cannot deny. First, people in humanities fields do not make as much money as science, technology, engineering and mathematics majors. This, although it may not be fair, is undoubtedly true; STEM majors are raking in up to $32,000 per year more than humanities majors. Second, STEM majors are more likely to get a job straight out of college — in fact, STEM majors’ initial unemployment rate is generally lower, with majors such as engineering yielding a 7 percent unemployment rate and health and the sciences at about 5 percent,  while that of humanities majors is at around 9 percent. There are countless other statistics that bash liberal arts majors. However, 40 percent of all liberal arts and humanities majors go on to receive graduate degrees, nearly halving the wage gap. As for unemployment, the discrepancy may be high straight out of college, but over time, the gap lowers to a mere 1 percent difference favoring non-humanities over humanities majors. When compared to humanities majors with graduate degrees, the rate actually favors the humanities by half a percent. So yes, there is a discrepancy between career fields when viewed from a quantitative perspective, but actually looking into the numbers reveals that even this discrepancy is not as large most people think it is. For some reason, however, this idea of measuring the value of a field by numbers has taken over our judgment system, especially with the obsession with the “dying humanities.” I’ve heard everyday conversations between STEM majors on campus discussing the uselessness of the humanities, but I’ve also heard plenty of conversations between humanities majors lamenting over the fact that their field is “dying” or joking that they’ll probably end up jobless. My question to both parties: Since when is the value of the humanities based on money? Why do we disrespect our own fields by accepting such a base method of value measurement? I’m not sure when the judgment metric shifted to numbers, but it seems that students in the humanities have now accepted and confirmed humanities’ death sentence by letting their value come from public perception and monetary earnings. Instead of combating public perception and STEM majors’ scorn with more numbers, (which may or may not convince) humanities majors (myself included) should be reiterating that the humanities will never die because their value lies within their contributions to humanity and society. The arts and humanities do much more than make money. They do exactly what the name implies: They help define who we are as human beings. The humanities show us who we were, who we are and who we can be — our history, our present and our future as individuals and as a society. They aid us in internal struggles and external ones, reminding us of past injustices that cannot be forgotten or repeated and reminding us of all the opportunities for a brighter future. Somehow, through endless scandal, bloody wars and merciless genocides, the human race has managed to hold onto a thread of humanity and justice, however thin this thread may be at times. The humanities — whether history, art, literature, music, etc. — set a solid foundation for our ability to be human and to treat other humans with respect. They chronicle our history and provide the only way to look back in order to change the future — we uncover old histories in order to write new ones. Don’t get me wrong: Technology, science and math have their place and are just as necessary. The humanities, however, touch the inner parts of our minds and souls in ways that technology alone cannot. People seem to forget the moment that tech-giant Bill Gates said this: “The goal should be that everybody gets a chance to read great books and participate in the richness that humanities bring us.” Or, when the other tech-giant of this generation, Steve Jobs, said this: “It’s technology married with liberal arts, humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.” Technology doesn’t cancel out the importance of the humanities any more than the humanities do the importance of technology. It’s time we accepted the fact that they can, and have to, coexist. A rise in “practicality” of one doesn’t mean the other loses any value whatsoever, unless your idea of “value” is as artificial as money. It’s time other majors stopped bashing the humanities, but it’s also time that humanities majors stop mourning their own fields. The humanities won’t die unless we allow death to be judged by numbers — and if we allow this, we’re killing the real purpose of the field on our own, without any outside help. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is called suicide.|~|Logan Sander is a freshman from Sylvania, Ohio. She can be reached at lmsander@princeton.edu.

70578|~|Differentiation in writing seminars|~|   October 14 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“Yeah, most people hate their writing seminars,” a junior told me outside J Street Library when I made a face to his question about whether I enjoyed my writing seminar. Immediately, a freshman boy who had been sitting across me protested, claiming that he immensely enjoyed his writing seminar and that he felt it did an adequate job in helping him become a better writer. Writing seminar, which is the one class that every Princetonian must take, seems to be a hit-or-miss experience for students. The effectiveness of writing seminars has been discussed numerous times before, many times in this very section. In the last academic year, there were two columns that discussed the effectiveness of writing seminar. One discussed the lack of focus on teaching research skills and called for a curriculum that places equal emphasis on writing skills and research skills to prep students for junior papers and senior theses. Another, written by a freshman enrolled in writing seminar at the time, pointed to the lack of uniformity among the various writing seminars and the fact that many students can evade doing assigned work in their writing seminars. One of the comments on this article echoed what I view as the main issue with writing seminars: the lack of acknowledgement that people enter the University with different levels of writing preparation. Freshmen do not arrive at the University having had the same high school experiences; some come from competitive schools with strong writing programs and some come from schools that barely required them to write. Placing all of these freshmen into the same level writing seminar makes as much sense as placing a person who is conversationally fluent in Spanish and someone who is a beginner in the same course. Effectiveness is maximized when students are on the same page, when professors do not need to struggle between the need to teach the basics of how to write an academic paper on one hand and the need to keep a more fluent writer engaged on the other. Our peer institutions seem to have discovered the issue of non-differentiation in teaching college-level writing courses. The website of the Critical Writing Program at the University of Pennsylvania summarizes the need for differentiation when it says, “Just as students who attended math- and science-intensive high schools may be better prepared for such courses at Penn, so too students who excelled at writing-intensive schools may be more advanced writers upon arrival. In turn, some students have had a bad experience with writing and, shying away from it, are not as practiced as their colleagues.” Understanding this, many of our peer institutions divide their freshmen into different level writing classes, either through a diagnostic test or self-placement. Harvard, for example, requires freshmen to read approximately 40 pages of scholarly work and compose an essay based on it within a 72-hour frame during the summer before they begin. They are then placed into one of two different levels. At Yale, most students choose to take a writing class despite there being no formal requirement. Students are allowed to go into either two different levels of freshman writing seminar or one for both freshmen and sophomores, which is more intense. Penn offers both the option of taking a diagnostic test and opting for self-placement into its three different writing seminars. It also has a course specifically designed for international students who do not feel comfortable with the prospect of having to write at the college level in English yet. Princeton should follow the lead of its peer institutions to offer classes that can help each and every student leave this place having become a better writer. The University should not offer classes where some people are feeling too challenged and some too bored. Writing is a universally important skill that should be continuously cultivated at every stage of someone’s life. Some people may have entered Princeton with the ability to write at a college level; they, too, have room for improvement. It is not only the people who lacked good guidance in high school who will benefit from differentiation. Everyone can become better writers in an environment that poses the right amount of challenge, and the University should take measures to cultivate such an environment for all students.|~|Erica Choi is a freshman from Bronxville, NY.

70568|~|Fruits are exotic. Humans are not.|~|   October 14 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Matthew Choi Taitano|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“How is your English so good?” I was confused by these words. I’ve never heard them before — not addressed toward me anyway. English is my first language after all, so why wouldn’t I speak it well? Then I realized why this person asked me this question. The answer is given when I look in the mirror. To many people here, I look “exotic,” and when they find out that I’m from Guam, my “exoticism” increases. However, I’m not exotic. I’m a human being. Fruits are exotic. Humans are not. This hasn’t been the only time that I’ve experienced something like this during my time at Princeton so far. I’ve heard, “What’s it like to be from a ‘territory?’ ” and “Have you ever heard about [insert big-name U.S. company]?” and, the most invasive of all, “What are you?” What am I? I’m a human being and a Princeton student, just like you. I guess I was struck by these questions because they were coming from the mouths of fellow Princeton students. At an institution filled with as much intellectual vitality and, in recent years, diversity as Princeton, I didn’t expect such questions. On the one hand, I don’t want to essentialize the entire student body, nor do I wish to condemn those who ask these questions. On the other hand, I do want to address the way in which these questions are asked. It’s OK to be curious about a person’s culture, race, etc., but the way in which we express our curiosity must be handled with great care. We shouldn’t use inconsiderate questions — such as “What are you?”— to learn more about a person. Instead, we should ask questions that are better crafted such as, “I’d love to know more about where you’re from. Can you share more about your culture with me?” These types of questions, which are cushioned with genuine curiosity and awareness, avoid any offensiveness that might manifest in the conversation. The University is a culturally and socially dynamic institution and only continues to become more so each year. Nevertheless, the hidden toxin of social ignorance and alienation still lingers on this campus. This problem can have detrimental effects on the psyches of the students who are on the receiving end. It causes them to question, “Do I deserve to be here?” To me, this self-doubt that is present in the minds of many students who face both explicit and implicit discrimination is one of the greatest injustices not only on Princeton’s campus but also in society as a whole. And it needs to stop. As an institution that many people across the world admire, the University must act as a prime example of a welcoming, inclusive and culturally courteous environment. The student body must learn to handle the myriad of cultures that exist on this campus. No longer can we pretend to believe that these problems don’t exist. Why do I see clusters of white people, clusters of black people and clusters of Asian people sitting at different tables? Why do I see some people acting skeptically around others who do not share the same skin color as them? Why do I hear people call Colonial Club the “Asian eating club,” Ivy Club the “elite white eating club” and Cannon Club the “black eating club?” Why did I hear the other day someone say that the Fields Center is “a place for African-Americans to hang out?” Why do some people in our student body, despite being some of the brightest individuals in the country, say such ignorant things? I have genuinely enjoyed the time that I have spent so far here at Princeton, but these problems cannot be dismissed. However, at the end of the day, I have faith. Call me an optimist, but I really do. Not too long ago, the University rejected women on campus; now the student population is nearly equal in terms of gender — even the dean of the college is female. Not too long ago, the University held a parochial view on sexuality; now it is ranked as one of the most LGBTQ-friendly institutions in America. To mitigate this problem of social segregation and discrimination, Princeton students must look beyond people’s skin color and other physical features and peer into the humanity that lies beneath. People on the outside of these cultural and racial groups must not solely define the people within them by the implications of what it means to be a part of those races and cultures, even though they are a big part of who these people are. In addition, when people start to become more accepting and respectful of other people’s cultures and races, these groups might not feel so compelled to stick to each other. Often, people in these groups feel the need to cling to each other because they find others not as welcoming. Keeping this in mind, Princeton students will be able to gradually rid the segregationist tendencies that still dwell on this campus.|~|Matthew Choi Taitano is a freshman from Yigo, Guam.

70520|~|Response from the Center for Jewish Life |~|   October 13 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|This is a response to Professor Max Weiss’s  October 12 article entitled “Is the Center for Jewish Life stifling free speech on campus?” Every member of the Princeton community is always welcome at the Center for Jewish Life. However, participation in a panel that we sponsor is a privilege and not a right. Our decision to sponsor or co-sponsor an event is an opportunity we evaluate in each case, not an entitlement on the one hand, nor an infringement of free speech on the other. The CJL is a community that promotes dialogue and open conversation. Last week, the CJL sponsored a program together with the Princeton Committee on Palestine, the Muslim Student Association, Near Eastern Studies, Tigers for Israel, and J-Street U featuring a Palestinian peace activist, Ali Abu Awwad. We were happy to sponsor a compelling program promoting a constructive, pro-solution perspective on ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Like any other organization, we have policies that inform our programming decisions.  A few years ago the CJL Board of Directors carefully crafted guidelines that embody our values. Under these guidelines, the CJL sponsors programs that provide opportunities for open discussion and the expression of differing views in the spirit of University life and in commitment to a pluralistic Jewish community. The CJL will not, however, sponsor groups or speakers that intend to harm Israel or promote racism or hatred of any kind. When Professor Max Weiss was suggested as one of many possible faculty speakers for a program that two CJL-affiliated student groups were hoping to co-sponsor with the Princeton Committee on Palestine in response to this summer’s conflict in Gaza, some of the student organizers ultimately decided not to invite him. They did so in consultation with CJL staff member Slav Leibin, and on the basis of the fact that Professor Weiss has supported the cultural and academic boycott of Israeli professors and institutions of higher learning, a position that infringes academic freedom and is incompatible with CJL event sponsorship on the basis of our guidelines outlined above. Professor Weiss’s personal attack on Slav Leibin, and the Jewish Agency with whom we partner, was unwarranted, and we believe Professor Weiss owes Slav and the CJL an apology.   The CJL is committed to ongoing learning and exchange of ideas through panel discussions, travel experiences, ongoing dialogues such as the Muslim-Jewish and Black-Jewish dialogues and hundreds of one-on-one conversations. We believe these efforts are more likely to bring about positive change than boycotts or newspaper articles that attack those working to find common ground.

70457|~|Enjoy the honeymoon|~|   October 13 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|A few weeks ago, I went to a law school admission presentation hosted by four of the top programs in the country. As a sophomore who still hasn’t fully decided what I want to major in, let alone what exactly I want to do after Princeton, I felt a bit awkward going. This was, of course, exacerbated by the fact that I assumed I’d be the youngest person there and that I really didn’t need to be thinking that far ahead yet anyway. But, nevertheless, I found myself a seat in the back of Frist Campus Center 302 less than two years after opening my acceptance letter from Princeton to hear about the law school equivalent of the Common Application and application process I feel like I just finished getting through. As it turned out, I was not the only sophomore at the event (which was held on Oct. 1 or less than a month into the school year), and I was doubly surprised to see one attendee raise their hand when one of the deans asked if there were any freshmen in the audience. While I admittedly had felt in myself some of the same qualities that undoubtedly motivated that individual to attend a meeting for a law school they won’t begin attending until 2018 at the absolute earliest (uncertainty about the future, curiosity, ambition), my first thought was, “Wow, that was a short honeymoon.” We spend an inordinate amount of our lives concerned with the ‘next step.’ Personally, I began preparing for the entrance exams for my grades 7-12 high school in the fall of sixth grade, started seriously thinking about college in the late spring of junior year and spent much of senior year applying for, stressing about and then planning for the start of college. The real ‘honeymoon period’ for me purely being able to enjoy the high point of my high school experience started only in January and then only because I was fortunate enough to get accepted early. So it could be said that of the past eight years of my educational life, I’ve spent nearly half worrying about ‘the next thing.’ I wouldn’t think it ridiculous to posit that this applies to many people on this campus as well. Many Princeton seniors will tell you that freshman year is spent learning the ropes, and junior and senior years are consumed with job hunting, interviews and grad school applications (not to mention independent work). It is sad — but makes sense — to acknowledge that only one of your four years here can truly be spent being here, exclusively, fully engaging in your Princeton experience without regard for the next possible steps of the future. If we’re only going to have one full year to enjoy Princeton completely, knowing this place well and not having to worry about what’s coming next, we should hold on to every moment of that year and try to extend the honeymoon period beyond it if circumstances allow. Let me be clear; I in no way wish to single out the freshman at the law school event I went to and attack their personal decision about when to start planning for the future. Rather, I simply wish to decry the way the current system requires us to spend so much of our present thinking about that future. At some point, it’s both OK and necessary to recognize that we are currently in the future we planned for ourselves and worked incredibly hard to reach. I’m not arguing that 12 months into our Princeton careers, we begin spending every waking moment filling out grad school apps; but I am saying that we are forced into worrying about our next steps — at least privately — too early in our Princeton years. A better world would be one in which society gives us a longer honeymoon period to enjoy the present we worked hard for in the past and one that delays just a little longer the inevitable planning for the next step. It’s wrong and a waste of time and talent to spend so much of our high school and college lives standing on an incredible pedestal, only to be distracted by concerns for the future and trying to use that pedestal as a springboard to the next one. Yes, the clock will one day run out on X phase of life, but the inevitability of changing life phases doesn’t have to mean we spend all our time planning for a future that always stays one step ahead of where we currently are.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

70456|~|Community engagement is not an experiment |~|   October 13 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|Institutions of higher education are no strangers to high-profile gifts from their successful alumni. In particular, Cornell University is the recent recipient of a $50 million gift from alumnus and billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn. This $50 million donation, which will be supplemented by another $100 million from outside donors, will fund the university’s new 10-year initiative called Engaged Cornell, which will encourage students to go beyond the classroom and have hands-on experiences through community-university partnerships. The goal of expanding the percentage of student engagement in communities to 100 percent is certainly noble and inspiring. However, the initiative’s goal to enable departments to offer these community-integrated courses at all levels of expertise, including introductory-level classes, can be troubling. In her Oct. 6 article in The New York Times, Ariel Kaminer covered the Einhorn Family Charitable Trust’s gift to Cornell through the lens of the recent interest in integrating student education with community service experience. She states that “interest in educational styles tends to run in cycles, and community engagement is a trendy topic these days.” Besides the problematic notion of community engagement as being “trendy,” Kaminer’s article also references Engaged Cornell and other university initiatives that integrate community participation and learning as “experiments.” While these two word choices may not be part of the point of Kaminer’s article, they do highlight the possible consequences of squeezing students from introductory-level courses (and not just advanced courses) into potentially high-impact programs. If we take a look at Princeton’s Program in Global Health and Health Policy, we can see the emphasis on developing students’ understanding and research of the subject before application. The program requires field- or lab-based research specifically during the summer between junior and senior years — the purpose of which is to make sure that students will already have taken the required core courses — GHP 350: Critical Perspectives in Global Health and GHP 351: Epidemiology — in their junior years before they go abroad. This is so that students will make their best efforts to be prepared for their field experiences ahead of time through courses like GHP 350 and 351. These courses provide students with an introduction to the world of development and policy and to the importance of acknowledging that their future actions in this world will have socioeconomic implications that will directly affect the lives of people around the world. Courses like GHP 350 and 351 inform and remind students that there really is a way to do service wrong. After all, if a community is willing to receive a student’s help and input, shouldn’t that student be knowledgeable about that community’s culture, history and economy as well as effective ways to establish a program that is both integrated and sustainable. There is a way to do volunteering, community engagement and policy-making incorrectly so that while they might have a “high-impact” effect on the targeted community, that impact may be undesired and perhaps even harmful to that community. While the lofty goals for Engaged Cornell have fantastic intentions, allowing students to engage in communities before they have received a certain amount of foundation in the classroom and from existing literature on a topic means that they’re going into these communities with a very small toolbox. Even though the students can learn on the job, there’s really not enough room for “trial-and-error” as learning usually involves because these are real people whom students work with. And these people may have already been struggling before that student came to “learn on the job.” Furthermore, within the goals of Engaged Cornell listed in the Cornell Chronicle on Oct. 6, the program plans to “launch a new engaged-learning leadership development program, available to all students across colleges, Leadership for the Greater Good, where student exemplars who successfully complete the program will receive special recognition upon graduation” by 2025. The possibility of special recognition for exemplary completion of the program upon graduation could mean that many students will try to participate in the program without the purity of intention and sensitivity that should drive community engagement. Sure, a major factor of participating in community service for students may already be that added resume boost, but the official honors that the initiative offers and promotes in its goals may accentuate this misguided way of thinking, and if anything, conflict with the intentions of the initiative itself. Besides the lack of formal learning in the classroom and the potentially counterproductive effect of offering special recognition, the program’s inclusion of students in introductory levels is inherently problematic in that it may include college sophomores and even freshmen. It is true that our freshman and sophomore years are characterized by large 200-person-plus lectures without much individualized attention or practical application of material, so a program like this can be a dream come true. However, encouraging students — who might not have had as much training, guidance or culture-specific classes as would an upperclassman — to get out there in the “real world” and make “high-impact” changes in the communities they’ve barely studied cannot be a wise allocation of such valuable resources. In spite of their emphasis on out-of-the-classroom teaching, community-engaged initiatives often fail to recognize that the classroom may be the place where students learn respect for the communities they wish to serve before they make the mistake of learning it the hard way.|~|Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major from Irvine, Calif.

70323|~|Is the Center for Jewish Life stifling free speech on campus?|~|   October 12 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Max Weiss I have never met Slav Leibin. Nonetheless, it recently came to my attention that he vetoed, with the approval of the Center for Jewish Life, my right to participate in a proposed panel on the recent hostilities in Gaza. Apparently this preemptive act of exclusion was carried out on entirely political grounds. This strikes me as an attempt to stifle the exchange of views on an important, if contentious, issue of concern to many in the Princeton University community — an egregious violation of our community’s values. Slav Leibin is the Jewish Agency Israel Fellow at the Center for Jewish Life, which is home to Hillel at Princeton. Founded in 1923, Hillel is the world’s largest Jewish student organization, with branches at more than 550 colleges and universities, guided by the mission of helping students “to explore, experience, and create vibrant Jewish lives.” Beginning in 2003, Hillel International has partnered with the Jewish Agency for Israel in order to place some 60 such Israel Fellows on almost 70 North American campuses, including Princeton. Prior to its creation in 1929, the JA was known as the “Palestine Zionist Executive,” and during the pre-1948 period it was responsible for Jewish settlement, immigration, and defense in Palestine. Since 1948, the JA has been the leading international Jewish nonprofit organization, funded by the Jewish Federations of North America as well as private donors in Israel and abroad, “providing meaningful Israel engagement and facilitating Aliyah” — literally, going up — that is, immigration of Jews to Israel and their naturalization as citizens there. Although technically autonomous, the JA effectively operates as an advocate for the government of Israel. For someone representing the JA to bar a member of the Princeton faculty from sharing his or her expertise and perspectives is no more acceptable than it would be for an envoy of the Chinese, Canadian or any other government to do the same. As a tenured member of the Princeton faculty with a joint appointment in the Departments of History and Near Eastern Studies, and as a scholar of the modern Middle East with considerable expertise in the history of Israel/Palestine, I am deeply troubled to discover that our campus life is not only being patrolled but even policed by non-academic figures here with a political mandate. In the wake of Operation Protective Edge, Princeton students attempted to organize a public event that would address the context and consequences of the Israeli assault on Gaza in July that left over 2,100 Palestinians and nearly 70 Israelis dead. Students then reached out to the Center for Jewish Life for co-sponsorship, presumably for an event to which I was going to be invited (I did not know of these plans at the time). In response, Mr. Leibin wrote in an email on Sept. 8, “I would like to bring to your attention that Max Weiss has recently signed a public statement supporting boycott of Israel. This issue complicates the program for us, as it is Highly [sic] sensitive for a CJL ASG to sponsor a program with a speaker who made a statement like this, which is one of the red lines in our Israel policy.” This point about “red lines in our Israel policy” needs to be understood in a larger context. Hillel International has a policy barring local chapters from sponsoring talks by, or symposia including, people whom Hillel deems overly critical of Israel. This policy has prompted a revolt by many students in Hillel chapters around the country, who insist they have a right to hear all perspectives, and a national Open Hillel movement, which held its first national conference this past weekend at Harvard. On October 10, president and chief executive officer of Hillel International Eric Fingerhut affirmed in the Israeli newspaper Ha`aretz that Hillel is committed to promoting “an environment that is “intellectually rigorous, respectful of difference and committed to honest conversation.” What Hillel International will not do, Fingerhut wrote, is “partner with organizations that espouse anti-Semitism, apply a double standard to Israel, spout racism or promote Islamophobia.” Recently Fingerhut met with Open Hillel activists, however, and told them, “every student is welcome at Hillel regardless of his or her personal views on Israel or any other topic in Jewish life.” Apparently, at Princeton, the same does not hold for faculty. I therefore ask the CJL to explain whether it believes that Mr. Leibin’s decision to bar a faculty member from sharing his expertise and perspective on an issue of concern to many members of our community is acceptable behavior and serves our students by promoting the free and full exchange of ideas and opinions. According to its own mission statement, the CJL “acts as a liaison with Princeton University on matters related to Israel.” How does the CJL understand the role of such a liaison? Is the CJL committed to sponsoring open debate and the free exchange of ideas with respect to “Israel or any other topic in Jewish life?” Or, does the CJL favor excluding some viewpoints and certain members of the Princeton community based on political criteria? Princeton must remain a place where open debate and academic exchange is encouraged and allowed to flourish, even on the most controversial issues.

70303|~|Towards a safe space in feminist discussions|~|   October 12 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Will Rivitz|~|   Columnist     |~|“Oh, I get it. You’re a feminist until it’s hard.” A fellow Princeton classmate dropped this insult on me during a heated discussion about the sexism of Reddit, and it stung. As a self-identified feminist (and, believe me, I know how toxic many articles can become when they begin with that phrase), I like to think that I’m doing something to dismantle sexism, or at least my own personal sexism, on a day-to-day basis. Even though I’m from the North, I’ve taught myself to use the phrase “y’all” instead of “you guys” because it is gender-neutral. I stay away from words like “bitch,” “bossy” and “slut” because I believe they perpetuate a very real culture of violence towards women, and I have called out people who use them in my presence. Most of all, I’ve been learning to recognize the absurd privilege I’ve inherited as a male (especially one who is also white and straight) in a society that is patently unfriendly to anyone who doesn’t identify as such. That being said, I think that in some forms of feminism, especially the more radical ones, there is some aggression towards men who may not think in the exactly same manner. In a recent column for the The Daily Princetonian, contributing columnist Newby Parton recounted his experience at USG town hall meeting in which he voiced a concern about how the University’s new policy towards sexual assault cases might increase the likelihood of false convictions. As he puts it, “I was accused of being ‘steeped in rape culture.’ [...] I did not dare speak again — my ideas were not welcome.” I do not entirely agree with the claims Parton makes in his editorial. I do believe that rape culture is a very real facet of our society, and the statistic that one in three American women will be abused sexually during her life provides ample proof of that. I also believe that misandry is a flawed argument – verbal attacks against men do not equate to deeply-rooted societal oppression. The only reason this column does not delve more deeply into issues of misogyny and rape culture is because there are countless other writers who have already done that better than I will ever be able to do. Finally, I don’t plan on making the #NotAllMen argument, because I believe it’s not true. We all have inherent sexist biases, no matter how much we try to ignore them, and the only way to have any hope of terminating those biases is to struggle actively against them at all times. However, Parton’s column raises a concern that has been troubling me for a long time: there seems to be a tendency in certain schools of feminist thought to jump down the throat of any man who makes a comment which doesn’t fully line up with that school’s way of thinking. Feminist discussions often claim a “safe space” in which any topic is valid for consideration. This safe space needs to include all people, not just members of the societally oppressed group. In my opinion, any all-inclusive discussion on misogyny should not include vitriolic anti-male polemic. If anything, every opinion should be treated as legitimate and should be critiqued and discussed respectfully. I’m not trying to argue that feminism should be easy for men to participate in. As Mia McKenzie writes for Black Girl Dangerous, feminism “requires [men] giving up power and all evidence suggests that’s not their super-fave thing. Share a link about gender equality? Sure! Count me in! Give up real power in real ways? Nope, not really.” Ideally, being a male feminist means fighting with all your might against a power structure favorable to you, and that can be very difficult. It’s especially because of this that comments like the one at the top of this article can be hurtful. Being a male feminist absolutely should not be glamorous, but at the very least I should be able to express potentially controversial opinions I truly hold without immediately feeling attacked unconstructively. Pragmatically, I’m more likely to critique my own opinion if the response to it is a civilly-worded counterargument rather than a vituperative accusation. At the farm I worked for in high school, one of our central tenets was the quote, “We are not to blame, and we are responsible.” The quote refers to privilege and oppression — we are not to blame for our own inherent biases and the current structures of power in place in America and the world, yet at the same time we are responsible for confronting those biases and demolishing those structures. To me, an important piece of feminism is holding lengthy discussions in an actual “safe space” without the fear that I’ll be massacred for a potentially controversial thought I’ve had. Unless we realize that everyone’s experience with sexism is unique, that confronting one’s own bigotry is hard work and that not everyone is already at the same point, this “safe space” will not exist.|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

70298|~|Editorial: Toward meaningful grading |~|   October 12 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Last Monday, University faculty members voted to revoke the policy of grade deflation implemented in 2004 and to move towards a grading system based not on numerical targets, but on standards determined by each individual department. As administrators and individual departments work to develop new guidelines for monitoring the general distribution of grades, the University community has an opportunity to reflect upon the priorities of its grading practices and to address the culture that surrounds grades on campus. In speaking to Monday’s faculty meeting, Dean of the College Valerie Smith recognized that “meaningful [grading] standards should be course- and discipline-specific.” In order for grades to be meaningful in the way that Dean Smith envisions, students should be able to privately view the breakdown of grades in courses they have completed and, additionally, the University should publish the general distribution of grades by course level (e.g., 200-level, 300-level) in each department. The ability for students to contextualize grades more meaningfully within their particular courses would greatly contribute to the emphasis on feedback that the University is working towards. Expectations can, and often do, fluctuate dramatically from course to course (and sometimes even from precept to precept) as a result of factors such as the preferences of particular instructors and the curve established by enrolled students. These inevitable inconsistencies make it imprudent to assess grades in a vacuum or to mistake them for universal indicators of aptitude. Students often wonder how their work compares to the average and what kind of performance level their grade really indicates. The University’s silence on these questions — a failure to supply the crucial other half of the story — leads students to view grades as rigid and inaccurate tools for judging students against one another rather than catalysts for intellectual growth. To demystify grades, the University must be more open about them. This openness must extend, at least to some degree, beyond the immediate University community. By publishing the general distribution of grades by course level in each department (a relatively abstract and yet much-needed measurement), the University would ensure greater levels of fairness in outside assessments of students’ performances, whether for prizes, internships, fellowships, graduate school admissions or jobs. While the University has historically included a letter explaining the grade deflation policy with each official transcript, releasing grade distributions would be more meaningful in the context of the department-dictated standards. Further, the types of courses which a student seeks out require just as much consideration as the student’s grades themselves. Many students suffer or benefit unduly from misleading stereotypes about the relative difficulties of departments and course levels, and providing rough data on such matters would enable more responsible readings of these students’ grades. The ability for students to point to the difficulty of their courses would also encourage them to challenge themselves in their studies: As the committee charged with reviewing grade deflation observed, the concern that grades will be misunderstood and viewed out of context has a stifling effect on students’ academic development. Students are frequently unwilling to take classes which they view as disproportionately challenging, regardless of their interest. In lieu of standardizing grades across courses and disciplines, the University should become more vocal and forthcoming about the discrepancies in evaluations of student work. What is needed most of all is context, from which students can come to understand the real meaning of their grades — and learn from them.  |~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The board answers only to its Chair, the Opinion Editor and the Editor-in-Chief.

69979|~|#Bringing back awareness|~|   October 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|In April earlier this year, 276 girls were abducted from an elementary school in Nigeria by Boko Haram, a terrorist group in northeast Nigeria. In the following months, the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls became near ubiquitous on social media and news broadcasts, gaining famous and influential proponents. Everyone from First Lady Michelle Obama to popular movie star Emma Watson took the time to write out the hashtag on a piece of paper, arrange some photo-appropriate writing, and then, at least in the case of Ms. Obama, hire a professional photographer to take a photo of her holding the sign with a reasonably forlorn expression. By June, the hashtag had been retweeted more than 4 million times on Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter. However, the cause has largely been forgotten since then, even though the girls are still in captivity. As The New Yorker describes it, “the girls have now been mostly forgotten by the citizens, celebrities, and politicians in other countries who once passionately pled for their release … A viral hashtag, it seems, is a fever that breaks quickly.” Even though the #BringBackOurGirls campaign was important in the sense that it forced the Nigerian government to acknowledge the problem instead of trying to cover it up as was the original intention, the campaign wasn’t sustained long enough to galvanize into action. Immediately after the kidnapping, the Nigerian military claimed it had rescued the girls, even though no such attempt had even been started. Only after a month of media pressure did Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan even acknowledge that the issue existed and began to accept international help from the United States, Britain, France and China. After that, the media firestorm and the urgency to “bring back our girls” declined precipitously, but what if it had continued? A video message from Boko Haram in July, three months after the capture, ridiculed the short-lived social media movement. In the video, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram’s leader, scoffs, “Bring back our girls? Bring back our army!” With the external pressure on Jonathan at a standstill now that social media has ended its fixation with this cause, it seems increasingly unlikely that a successful exchange will ever be negotiated. It is also difficult for the foreign governments that are still willing to help negotiate for the permission to increase help in the region, because the Nigerian government is trying to cover up the incident as media attention dies down. Local activists who are still dedicated to the cause are victims of government harassment since Jonathan blames activists for politicizing the kidnapping as he prepares for the 2015 presidential election. In some cases, bringing awareness to a cause is important if it forces neglectful governments to take action, but the key is that the awareness must instigate action. The problem with short-lived, trendy social media campaigns is that it is certainly a fashionable way to make a statement and show compassion toward an issue, but doesn’t resolve anything unless the attention remains fixed, or even better, unless people make a concerted attempt to contribute in more ways than a #hashtag. On campus, there are a lot of groups that coordinate events, fundraisers, and awareness campaigns in response to pressing current issues. For example, the Princeton Hong Kong Students’ Association in early October urged everyone to wear yellow and take a photo in a show of solidarity and support for the Hong Kong protests. Even if the impact is small, the most important thing for student groups who want to affect change is to keep people’s attention on the protests and not let important issues fade into obscurity.|~|Barbara Zhan is an operations research and financial engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

70072|~|Editorial: Engineering school enhancements|~|   October 9 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Princeton, as this year’s Undergraduate Announcement states, aims to teach “fundamental engineering principles” and their “applications to modern problems.” While the Engineering School has served B.S.E. students well, the Editorial Board believes that two major changes should be made to improve engineering offerings in fulfillment of these goals. Specifically, the board believes that electrical engineering and computer science departments should be combined into one department — EECS — and materials science and engineering should be made into a full engineering major. Combining computer science and electrical engineering would benefit students in a variety of ways. First, a combined department would result in a broader curriculum that better serves the purpose of the B.S.E. program. Currently, computer science students are required to take two theoretical computer science courses. While the board understands the importance of the theoretical underpinnings, the board feels that “fundamental engineering principles” could be better taught by requiring students in the new EECS department to take many of the 200-level ELE courses instead. For example, according to the Registrar, the required course ELE 206: Contemporary Logic Design teaches both “programmable logic” and “basic computer organization,” skills that both programmers and electrical engineers often utilize heavily. While theory is certainly important, the board believes that its “application to modern problems” do not meet the criteria of Princeton’s B.S.E. program.  A combined program would allow theory requirements to be replaced with courses like ELE 206, which the board believes are better suited to solving modern technical challenges. Further, combining these departments would allow for better differentiation between the two computer science programs the University currently offers. As it stands, the only differences between the A.B. and B.S.E computer science programs are the independent work requirements, the prerequisites and the distribution requirements, all of which are inherent differences between A.B. and B.S.E. The differentiation between EECS and CS could allow students to more accurately signal to employers and graduate schools where their academic interests and skills lie. Similarly, a materials science and engineering major would allow students to delve deeper into research in a growing department at Princeton than the certificate of the same name currently allows. Materials research is a growing field with increasingly broad applications to modern problems. The most recent Nobel Prize in Physics, awarded Tuesday, was given to scientists recognized for their work in materials. The Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials currently engages in a diverse range of materials research, boasting several research centers with faculty from almost every STEM field. Students in a MSE concentration would benefit from this interdisciplinary research in a way that they currently cannot due to the potentially conflicting nature of department and certificate requirements. Further, the current certificate program requires students to take six courses in addition to the engineering prerequisites and write a two-semester long thesis on a materials-related topic. The development of a materials curriculum would thus only require two additional courses to match the rigor and breadth of other engineering fields. While the board understands that students have the option of majoring in one of many related fields and simply focusing on materials research, a separate department would give students the opportunity to approach interdisciplinary research with a focus on materials rather than a focus on a field which interests them less. The board believes that both changes to the engineering school would improve the experience of students and benefit the University’s research output and application pool. Several institutions with competing engineering programs, including MIT and Cornell University, have materials engineering concentrations and combined EECS departments. The board believes that making the above changes would improve the University’s reputation as a school with a strong engineering program. This would, in turn, improve both the influx of research dollars as well as the quality of engineering applicants. The board recognizes that these changes are major and could require the hiring of new faculty and possibly the construction of new research facilities. However, if the University aims to continue its ascendance as a school of engineering excellence, the board believes that these two changes should be adopted.|~|The Editorial Board is an independent body and decides its opinions separately from the regular staff and editors of the ‘Prince.’ The board answers only to its Chair, the Opinion Editor and the Editor-in-Chief. 
70082|~|“It’s not you, it’s me”: Princeton’s breakup with tradition|~|   October 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|They’d been together for ten years. But they’d been fighting a great deal recently, trying to eschew an inevitable split. And after an hour or two of careful retrospection and introspection, just like that, it was over. The two would part ways. It was time to let go and move on. So goes the tragic end to the long-time love story between Princeton and grade deflation, with the repeal of the infamous grading policy. The decision allows each department to establish its own grading standards – standards that won’t necessarily include numerical quotas of A’s. The previous policy mandated that no more than 35 percent of the grades given to students in any one department should be in the A range, and that no more than 55 percent of the grades assigned to independent work should be in the A range. This limit on the number of A’s given out was not intended as a strict quota, but was often interpreted as such by both students and faculty. This grade deflation policy was an endeavor to combat the grade inflation trends at Princeton. The new policy, which is now in effect, removes the previous numerical targets. In other words, there no longer is an explicit limit on the number of A’s that can be given out. Instead, individual departments and programs will evaluate and establish their own respective grading standards, which in turn will be evaluated for consistency and fairness every fall. Furthermore, a greater emphasis will be put on professors providing clear and detailed feedback to students on a more frequent basis (not just at the end of the semester), and the Committee on Grading is to be eradicated. Under the new policy, one could say that grade deflation may unofficially continue within the individual departments. While there won’t be an explicit cap on the number of A’s given out, professors may just continue to sparsely award A’s. While I generally don’t split hairs over semantics, I’d like to emphasize the word “award” in the previous sentence. Are A-grades to be awarded — or earned? The distinction between those two words points to an immutable aspect of Princeton’s grading culture. If a student works hard for an A and turns in work that deserves an A by the standards of any rational professor, then he/she has earned that A. It’s as simple as that – or at least, it should be. But under the status quo, getting an A-grade is a ruthless, unceasing struggle of the fittest to the end, with A’s remaining rare for no justifiable reason other than to bolster the perceived difficulty of this school. Ultimately, it comes down to this: it’s all about the grades. Princeton has engendered a culture that attributes exorbitant value to a letter grade. With this overemphasis on grades and the perpetuation of this struggle of the fittest comes the reinforcement of a divide between students. A letter grade neither helps a student learn nor serves as quantifiable proof of a student learning, which is why we should emphasize better feedback from professors, as the new policy proposes. But even with the good-intentioned recommendations of the new policy, grade deflation’s repeal won’t do much to change this grade-frenzied culture on campus. Professors will continue to informally put out grade quotas, the grade point average will continue to be lower than other comparable institutions and students will continue to fret over how they will fare in the grad school applicant pool. While such high standards are intended to compel students to work and push themselves even harder, this exclusivity in grades correlates to and reinforces the exclusivity of this institution as a whole. And there is no foreseeable end to this exclusivity, as long as we continue to emphasize the importance of a letter grade. It’s all an intrinsic, irrevocable part of Princeton’s grade culture. And now there is a very tangible fear of students gravitating towards majors and programs with higher numbers of A-grades, since individual majors will be determining their own grading standards independently of each other. This “grade-centrism” will continue to plague the Orange Bubble, as students will continue to surrender to apprehension over getting a good job or getting into grad school over choosing to study what they’re truly passionate about, regardless of how hard it is to get an A. So now, I’ve got 99 problems and choosing a major with less austere grading standards could be one.|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz. She can be reached at ssakha@princeton.edu. 
70013|~|Beyond the rhetoric: Diversity unveiled |~|   October 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Princeton University has deepened the anguish and intensified the alienation of its graduate students of color, all in the name of expanding diversity. On Oct. 2, 2014, the Graduate School announced its plan to add two diversity staff positions. But the Graduate School’s said commitment “to build and expand upon the work” of an office that no longer exists is just that: something said. With the departure of Karen Jackson-Weaver, there is no longer an Associate Dean primarily devoted to issues of diversity, who can advocate at the senior level.  Her former position as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Diversity has devolved into two subordinate roles. The two positions in Academic Affairs formerly supervised by Jackson-Weaver will now fall under the purview of Associate Dean Cole Crittenden, alongside his other commitments, and Associate Dean Lisa Schreyer, whose portfolio includes a host of other competing priorities, will oversee the two additional staff positions. Here diversity comes under the adopted supervision of Academic and Student Affairs. It retains no formal standing among senior administration. The previous arrangement under the supervision of Dean Jackson-Weaver was not perfect, but it achieved something that this new administration has all but destroyed: A truce. Students of color are constantly besieged by the racism at Princeton. Surviving Princeton, for students like us, is more than a struggle: It is a battle for one’s life and sanity, for the dignity of one’s non-white flesh. But this reality has largely been kept from public view, because of the judgment of administrators we could trust. Well, that trust is gone. In failing to prioritize our issues, the new administration reveals its own lack of vision. As graduate students of color, we demand more than idle words and expanded portfolios. We want tangible commitment, which implies empowering those who are thoroughly qualified and sufficiently protected to work on our behalf: Those who can stand in solidarity with our grievances and not feel threatened. When differences in perspective arise, we need the influence of persons who can relate to our concerns, while also attending to the oversights of other administrators. As the Report of the Trustee Ad Hoc Committee on Diversity affirmed, “If the senior administration does not include individuals with sufficiently diverse backgrounds and experiences, it will be virtually impossible for Princeton to achieve the cultural change to which it aspires.” But diversity is a doing, not just a saying. An institution’s ordering of its powers and resources reveals its priorities. Sadly, the reordering of positions devoted to diversity in the Graduate School is no sign of prioritization: it simply introduces more persons of color with less influence. In this way, the Graduate School administration has betrayed the trust it wishes to inspire concerning its talk of diversity. The new administration can hardly sense what it doesn’t know about these issues and it possesses no discernible way of correcting for such ignorance — which is terrifying. This is why we are bringing the darkness of our underworld into public view: A veil is being lifted here at Princeton. Maybe then we’ll be granted the priority we seek. If not for ourselves, then for those who are coming after us.

69930|~|Questions about the end of grade deflation|~|   October 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ali Akram Hayat|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The end of grade deflation was initially met with delight, then with some skepticism and finally — as with all things unclear and undefined — with confusion. Here is a look at some questions contributing to the confusion: 1) Is no grade deflation synonymous with grade inflation? When the policy was introduced in 2004, it was hoped that peer institutions would follow suit. There has been great scrutiny over the ‘inflation’ of grades at Harvard and Yale recently, which raises the following question: Will the repeal bring us closer to the situations at Harvard or Yale, or will grades reflect a new, not-deflated-but-also-not-inflated model? If so, what would that entail for grading rubrics, or for the percentage of A-grades given out? 2) How much power and influence will departments have in establishing their grade standards? Now that grade deflation is gone, departments have been entrusted with establishing malleable and non-uniform grading standards. It should be interesting to see how much control they really have over this, especially if some departments want to retain grade deflation standards. What “repealing grade deflation” would mean in that case is that the University won’t enforce deflation, but specific departments may very well do so. In that case, deflation, or the 35-percent threshold, may remain, and things may not change much in practice. The Daily Princetonian’s report mentions the substitution of “old numerical targets” with “grading standards developed by each department.” This is a problematic statement, because numerical targets are not mutually exclusive with department-specific standards. It is hardly revolutionary for a University-wide cutoff target to be replaced by similar targets established by every department. 3) Will there be a disparity between departments? If so, will that be checked? Going off the last question, now that departments seemingly have more authority on grading rubrics, will there be a disparity between grades awarded across departments? Will there be a schism between science, technology, engineering, math and other disciplines? If so, how will the University maintain consistency? After all, the 35 percent guideline itself was meant to induce consistency. Clearly, there needs to be much more thought given to how this consistency will be achieved now, because that is crucial to the success of the repeal. 4) What is a “meaningful” grading standard, and how is greater faculty feedback mutually exclusive with grade deflation? A puzzling aspect of the repeal is the apparent replacement of grade deflation with a more “meaningful” standard. In and of itself, this statement does not mean anything at all. Every grading system tries to be “meaningful.” Again, grade deflation was itself introduced to make grading at the University more meaningful. The real issue is discovering ways to bring this change. Moreover, there will now be a greater emphasis on increased feedback from faculty members. While this is a good initiative, it remains to be seen how it replaces grade deflation. Surely, greater feedback can and should coexist with grading rubrics, and should be independent of how strict grading is. 5) How will the Classes of 2015, 2016 and 2017 be affected? There is no better time to be a freshman. For better or worse, grade deflation is gone, so the Class of 2018 will be subject to a (supposedly) uniform grading criterion for all four years. How will the other classes be affected? The University has announced that a letter explaining Princeton’s grade deflation policy will accompany the transcripts of the members of these classes, with an additional note reporting that the policy has now been repealed. But what does that mean? Grade deflation primarily impacts introductory-level courses, which most juniors and seniors and a significant number of sophomores are beyond. In that sense, they have already suffered the worst of grade deflation, without qualifying for the letter to potential employers and graduate programs. Will the end of grade deflation harm the prospects of members of these classes, rather than benefiting them? 6) Can this be the instigator for further changes? In the past month, the University has remodeled its mechanism to deal with sexual harassment and assault (granted, it was in reaction to federal pressures), and grade deflation, two highly controversial facets of life at Princeton until now. However, there are other potential areas that require a rethink too, ranging from a restructure of mental health procedures, to revising the preceptorial system, to perhaps even rethinking the timing of winter break. If grade deflation can be ‘fixed’, so can these things, and perhaps the biggest triumph of this repeal will be the empowering of the University community to discuss more critically other areas of concern and perhaps revamp them as well. 6.5) Never mind everything else, now that grade deflation is gone, what excuse do we now use to defend our GPAs?|~|Ali Akram Hayat is a philosophy major from Lahore, Pakistan.

69949|~|Let’s talk about sex |~|   October 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Last week I sat, panicked, in the waiting room of McCosh Health Center. I was going to die; I was sure of it. I was awaiting the results of a sexually transmitted disease test panel that, since high school, I have scheduled routinely. Originally at the insistence of my mother (“I don’t know, and I don’t want to know, but just get into the habit of doing this before you go to college,” she had said — God bless her), it’s a habit I have tried to establish and continue for my own peace of mind as I navigate college and beyond. Unfortunately, I have an irrational fear of contracting HIV, and whenever I’m waiting for the results of this 15-minute test I become acutely paranoid, and, as I sat in the pleather University Health Services waiting room chair last week, I came close to hyperventilating. I know that the fear is entirely unfounded, and I remember from awkward, middle school sexual education courses that catching an STD is not an everyday ordeal unless you are participating in high-risk sexual activities. However, my logic fails me here: I still sit, waiting, breathing heavily, praying. In the aftermath of my breakdown and its anticlimactic resolution (negative, as expected), I was able to attribute a large portion of my anxiety to the invisible, lurking presence that sexual health topics assume after the initial middle school talks and the short renaissance they enjoy in a brief orientation segment of freshman week. It’s there, and we know it’s there, but we never really openly acknowledge that it’s there. I remember a few scattered posters from UHS advertising STD testing toward the end of last year, but that was about all I encountered regarding sexual health. It’s time to bring the issue to the foreground. While I would probably still feel uneasy during the situation described above, I think a more honest and open discourse would at least eliminate the monolithic mystery of STDs that their obscurity affords them. Granted, I am sure there are spaces available for students looking to discuss issues and ask questions related to sexual health on campus, but a cultural shift in attitudes toward sexuality, through conversation and education, would be more conducive in helping us reach an understanding of what STDs, sexual health and sexuality in general mean. Sex is the great skeleton in the closet of American culture, and, as a nation, we have always grappled with the intersection of romance and promiscuity, virtue and obscenity. It’s been easier for us to put sexual health out of sight, out of mind, always secret and discrete, rather than risk being perceived as a slut or as reacting like a prude. Even when we talk about sex — and we’re college students, so we talk about sex — it’s rarely related to actual sexual health. The subject is so under-discussed on campus that, until I ventured to McCosh, I had no idea that HIV/AIDS testing is free to students, even those not enrolled in the Student Health Plan. The resources are available, they are just never discussed, and I know many who do not take advantage of them. Perhaps this lack of open dialogue between students is due in part to the repercussions of slut shaming and the misconception that STDs is only for the promiscuous, or perhaps it is due to America’s historic tradition of sexual silence. Regardless, students should be more proactive about engaging in continuous dialogue about sexual health and sexual health services starting middle school. This is especially important on a university campus like Princeton’s. The patchwork of sexual education laws across the country is disturbing — with some states requiring little more than the zealous, sex-equals-death program which is most likely partly to blame for my irrational fear of STDs at large — creates disparate understandings of the risks and the myths of sexuality. While legislation to create a more cohesive set of programs takes time, college campuses can immediately facilitate conversation that helps create a more universal understanding. Open and honest conversation will ensure a safer and less sensationalized campus attitude about sex.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a sophomore from Phoenix, Ariz. He can be reached at mjhammer@princeton.edu.

69771|~|Price of a life|~|   October 7 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|At noon on the afternoon of Aug. 9, Michael Brown was shot to death in Ferguson, Mo. The event spurred days of rioting and unrest in the Southern city. Media coverage of the turmoil was extensive, but both the actual events that transpired and the manner in which the media was covering the events were shrouded in controversy. The protests and rallies continue both in Ferguson and across the country though the mainstream media has begun to spend less time covering them. This past week, the University held a candlelight vigil for Brown. Though it’s been close to two months since the shooting, there are still only a handful of irrefutable facts: Brown was an unarmed 18-year-old, and he was shot to death by a police officer. Media outlets speculated further. Some accounts insisted that Brown was complying with the police officer’s demands and that the bullets were entirely unwarranted, and others said that Brown had just robbed a convenience store and that he had engaged in a scuffle with police officers moments before the shooting. The media was quick to latch onto this particular fact — that Brown might have shoplifted from a 7/11 — as if it were an asterisk underscoring the entire ordeal: Were the bullets unwarranted, or were they justified? The New York Times described Brown soon after as “no angel.” NBC News chose a photo of an unsmiling Brown glaring down into the camera and flashing a supposed gang sign to accompany the article written about the events. The media had made their decision — they would portray those bullets as justified. The hashtags #ifIwasgunneddown and #iftheygunnedmedown quickly began to trend on Twitter, where young women and men of color presented two images of themselves: one featuring drugs, alcohol and snarling grimaces; the other with a smile and a diploma. The point was to draw attention to the way the media portray young people of color in shootings such as this, as though the impact of their deaths could be lessened in some way by a joint they smoked when they were 17. The hashtag campaigns reinforced the argument that Brown’s race was a strong contributing factor to both the police officer’s instinctive reaction and the media’s immediate angle in covering the story. The thing is, it shouldn’t even be up for discussion whether Brown’s death was justified. The government’s taking a life is distinctly within the parameters of capital punishment, legal in many parts of the United States. However, capital punishment is limited in the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution to aggravated murders committed by mentally competent adults. The process is meticulous and painstaking, involving grand juries and meticulous legal representation to determine whether someone who has taken a life deserves the same fate. It is rare that the answer is yes —  fewer than 40 death sentences were carried out last year. A single police officer should not have the authority to carry out capital punishment — especially on a whim. The fact that there was a heated scuffle and that everything happened within the span of a few minutes doesn’t take away from the fact that Brown’s death sentence was doled out without a fair trial or really any trial at all. Brown left his family that morning without any idea that he would never see them again. When the media subtly tries to justify the death of Brown by suggesting that he had stolen something from the nearby convenience store minutes before, they are essentially saying that he deserved it. One in every 11 people will shoplift at some point in their lives, according to HG.org, a law and government information site. It’s a petty misdemeanor that often doesn’t even result in jail time, let alone the death sentence. Insisting that Brown was “no angel” isn’t an argument either. Eighteen-year-olds are barely adults. They have lived under their parents’ roofs for most of their lives. They haven’t yet had the chance to see the world and to develop beliefs and convictions of their own. Not having your life completely and entirely figured out after graduating the 12th grade doesn’t make you any less worthy of living. It’s important that our campus held a vigil for Brown. Though the media’s attention might have turned elsewhere, people still care about what happened and want to prevent something similar from happening again. In the particular case of the vigil, we are remembering the person himself — humanizing him — rather than prioritizing the act, the media ruckus or even the riots. Reading about Brown’s death on the Internet, where there are so many degrees of separation and such a bias toward the flashy and extreme, can sometimes strip away the humanity of the situation. It becomes colder and more clinical and easier to forget that Brown was a boy who did not deserve to die, even if he did fill his pockets up with stolen merchandise from a 7/11 or say something rude to a police officer. Things like that do not warrant a death sentence. To live in a country were the media could suggest that a killing was justified because the victim was “no angel” is barbaric. Brown didn’t owe it to anyone to be an angel. The agreement was never that he had to be an angel to retain the right to his own life.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a molecular biology major from Cresskill, N.J.

69795|~|The importance of knowing what you're talking about|~|   October 7 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|At the University, and in Western culture at large, it is very common to take a very myopic viewpoint of international affairs. I believe it is important to correct this viewpoint, especially at Princeton, because the people who are learning to look at the world in this limited way are the same people who will soon be leading it. We can start by knowing when to step back and stop talking. One example of the sort of narrow vision that I am talking about occurred in a class I took last year, a class that I, for the most part, greatly enjoyed. The focus of the course was primarily on Western philosophies. However, there was one incident in which my preceptor, a former professor, attempted to reach outside of that narrow focus and, in doing so, greatly offended me.  First, some background information is necessary. I am Sudanese; my parents are from the northern part of the now-divided country. Because of this, I know a few things about Sudanese politics. In class one day, my preceptor was talking about dictatorships versus anarchies. To illustrate what he meant, he gave Sudan as an example of anarchy. He was wrong. First of all, he was discussing the dichotomy of dictatorships and anarchies. In that dichotomy, Sudan’s government, headed by the unstable Omar al-Bashir, can only be characterized as a dictatorship. That is to say, he was not just slightly mistaken; he was, in fact, completely wrong. I do not believe that everyone must necessarily have a strong understanding of the way every government in the world works. That is likely impossible. What I took issue with was the way in which he and others did not find his lack of knowledge to be enough reason to stop talking. It is a sort of arrogance that often comes out in matters of foreign affairs; despite knowing nothing about the topic, people feel confident giving strong opinions and even stating incorrect “facts.” He could have easily avoided the entire situation simply by making no comment on a country about which he clearly knows little. The problem is, when even a former professor and preceptor doesn’t take the time to distinguish between African nations, it creates an atmosphere where that sort of distinction is not valued. This sort of error, small though it may seem, is actually very harmful because it is part of a larger culture in which people do not feel the need to differentiate between foreign countries. This can have catastrophic consequences in matters of foreign policy. For example, this summer, a Washington Post/ABC poll, found that 65 percent of Americans were in favor of launching airstrikes in Syria. But a January 2013 Pew Research Center poll found that 50 percent of Americans could not correctly identify a shaded country on a map as Syria. This is the sort of carelessness about grave matters that occurs when we pretend we know more than we actually do. It represents this sort of false knowledge, this action without understanding that was demonstrated on a way smaller scale, by my preceptor when he confidently made assumptions about Sudan and its government. We, as Princetonians, need to make a concentrated effort to sometimes say, in class or even in casual conversation, “I don’t know enough to comment.” This has the potential to have enormous implications for things like precept. Obviously, in class, there is certain information that students are responsible for knowing. However, when the discussion veers away from that and connections and extrapolations are being drawn, people need to be comfortable clearly stating where their knowledge ends. There is no shame in simply not knowing everything. Additionally, we stand to learn so much more when we take the time to sit out of a conversation about which we know little and simply listen. At Princeton, there are students and professors who are experts in certain topics or have experienced very diverse viewpoints. Imagine how much we could learn if we spent less time pretending to be experts and more time asking each other questions. Imagine how much more meaningful precept could become if we cut out the fluffy postulating and limited ourselves to topics about which we are knowledgeable. I, for one, would certainly be interested in the conversations that would arise if we did. The positive effects would spread out past precept, too, so that even regular conversations could have more value. Some of us will go on to work in governments, and most of us will go on to vote for leaders who will be speaking about foreign policy, and in order to make the most of those opportunities, we need to admit what we don’t know.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va.

69781|~|The harmful dissemination of stereotypes|~|   October 7 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|Last week, Newby Parton wrote quite the controversial column. He began by discussing our revised sexual assault policy but quickly devolved into perceptions of equating feminism with misandry, which were unsubstantiated and which unfortunately furthers a very harmful and false societal trope and obfuscates the much-needed, meaningful dialogue regarding sexual assault. Let me just state for the record that I’m all for edgy pieces that put forth a controversial view, especially one that sparks debate across campus, as this one did. Many valid viewpoints about feminism exist that are important for our generation to debate — from what it is, to what it should be, to what we can and should do about it — yet Parton’s legitimization of harmful stereotypes is not one of these viewpoints. Parton claimed that because “a few women have turned the dialogue [on sexual assault] into a battle against men and women,” “we,” presumably referring to his fellow men, are “begin[ning] to think that this is what feminism has become — a bias against males that mistakes all male viewpoints for oppression.” He concluded that misandry is hijacking feminism based on what happened at the Undergraduate Student Government town hall on campus sexual assault. He said that he “voiced a single worry … that the new ‘preponderance of the evidence’ standard will, definitionally, increase the likelihood of false convictions” and then “cries of ‘rape culture’ spewed forth.” However, I too attended the USG town hall, and the facts just don’t support Parton’s claims or his conclusions. The rights of the accused were a large focus of the meeting, easily commanding over 50 percent of the discussion. After quite a few comments on the rights of the accused had come forth — interestingly enough all by men — a woman suggested a different topic, thereby implying that other issues are also worth discussing. And after a few different comments, others again turned the conversation to the rights of the accused. After allowing quite a bit more discussion on the issue, an administration official in attendance responded that false accusations resulting in disciplinary actions had not really been an issue historically and that she didn’t believe that it would be a problem going forward under the new standard. Moreover, it was clarified that the policy change was a federal mandate. The administrator made it clear that, contrary to the suggestion in Parton’s column, the accused would not be presumed guilty until proven innocent, and “verbal testimony alone” would not “be enough to convict an accused perpetrator.” Rather, the evidence would have to be determined to be more likely than not true for disciplinary action to move forward. It is unfortunate that Parton felt his concerns regarding the rights of the accused were not welcome, even though the concerns of the rights of the accused were addressed. To be honest though, I am not too concerned about Parton’s hurt feelings. I am concerned that his column has proliferated two incorrect and harmful views: first, that the new sexual assault policy presumes that the accused are guilty until proven innocent. And second, that women who support the new policy, or even just want to discuss issues beyond the rights of the accused, are misandrists, or even that it is legitimate for others to see them as such. I saw no evidence at the meeting that anyone there hated men. Unless the women at the town hall were asked specifically, there is not even a preponderance of evidence to suggest that one, much less all, of the women there are self-identified feminists, nor that they hate any or all men. They were probably just frustrated that no other topic was getting an opportunity to be heard and disliked Parton’s effort to bring up a retreaded issue. Moreover, were it true that even one of those women is a self-identified feminist who hates certain men, that still does not justify the conclusion that it appears as though feminists are misandrists. Just as men can loathe individuals for various reasons, women can too without it meaning they hate an entire group simply for their identity. The onus should not be on women who are speaking out on an issue to avoid possibly being labeled as feminist misandrists; it should be on society as a whole not to extrapolate from an individual to an entire gender or other shared identity group. Parton’s labels are perpetuating stereotypes, not proposing a just solution to sexual assaults on our campus or gender inequality overall. When discussing my thoughts on writing a response to Parton’s column, my mom warned me not to be emotional. I understand where she is coming from. By being emotional about this issue, I realize that some will conclude I am simply an emotional, angry feminist. I actually happen to be a self-identified, angry feminist. Yet, I should have the same right to be as angry and emotional as Rush Limbaugh, Newby Parton and other men are every day — and I should have the right, without others assuming that all women are always angry at all men. I don’t hate men for simply being male. I just don’t like when any person legitimizes stereotypes, perpetuates false tropes or hinders an important discussion on sexual assault on campus (a discussion that men and women at the University and across the United States must continue) rather than fights gross generalizations. But this is just my view; it shouldn’t be taken as representative of an entire gender.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu.

69670|~|Study Abroad Chronicles: Frosh Week Abroad|~|   October 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I’ll be writing my next few pieces on what it’s like to be studying abroad at a university in the United Kingdom. I’m at The School of Oriental and African Studies within the all-encompassing University of London. Freshman week unites us in special ways. “Freshers’ week” does the same thing in the United Kingdom, binding students with a caffeine-fueled week of presentations about libraries, registering for classes, scavenger hunts and enthusiastic upperclassmen. Although reminiscent of freshman week, the biggest difference between the University and The School of Oriental and African Studies is their definitions of a university education. SOAS is a younger, smaller, bolder institution whose goals can consequently be more precise and ambitious. The first difference is the definition of an academic experience. When the director of SOAS spoke about the institution’s history, she proudly explained, “SOAS was founded to focus specifically on Asia, Africa and the Middle East.” The school only offers area-specific classes in anthropology, sociology, economics, history, history of art and archaeology, music, religion and the arts. The academic experience here is therefore linked with a new, important narrative of study that is inclusive of historically academically underrepresented regions of the world. While the University does support research and teaching that challenges existing scholarship, the majority of disciplines, languages and regional studies are fairly traditional. This difference can be traced to the founding of both institutions — ours founded with a charter to welcome students “of every Religious Denomination” after the religious upheavals in the British colonies during the 18th century, and SOAS founded with a charter (nearly 200 years later) to advance British scholarship of its own colonies. The University’s diversity is held in its students, while SOAS’s is held in the subjects it offers. The emphasis on language is another difference within the definition of an academic experience. The school offers languages like Tibetan, Zulu, Kurdish and Indonesian. Every student is encouraged to take a language through the Language Entitlement Programme that ensures students in every discipline have a spot as an auditor for one year in a language of their choice, or a free class through the SOAS Language Centre, a separate, for-profit school that accepts students of all ages from all over the United Kingdom for weekly, summer or intensive language classes. Knowing that my friends in the engineering school often have trouble fitting languages into their schedule, I think Princeton could learn from a program like this. The second realm is the definition of a social experience. At the welcome reception for the history department, the professors insisted they all be called by their first names. They encouraged students to learn from living in the city as much as from archives. (As the town of Princeton was founded somewhere in the 17th century, and London was founded in 43 A.D., this is, of course, an unfair comparison.) However, it’s still worth encouraging students to dive into the history and culture the town of Princeton has to offer. Furthermore, all the freshmen events are open, enthusiastically, to study abroad, exchange and graduate students. Freshman week for us is exclusively for freshmen, but after experiencing the range of people at freshman week in SOAS, I believe it can only do the University community good to open some of the freshman events non-freshmen who are also new to the University. The third realm is the definition of an international experience. Ranked eighth in the world for diversity of student body, SOAS has international students representing 160 countries and 38 percent of the student body, compared to Princeton’s 11 per cent. Perhaps this is due to ease of mainland Europeans accessing university in the United Kingdom, but it’s nonetheless an undeniable statistic. Anyone pursuing a degree in area studies must complete one year abroad in the area of research, and anyone pursuing a joint degree in a language must also spend time in that country. Anyone can study abroad. This is not the same at the University, due to perceived difficulty and availability of class credit transferring. While I do not advocate that studying abroad is for everyone, I believe more students in more departments should at least have the option to go abroad rather than feel constricted by departmental requirements. As expected, however, the root of a university is the same everywhere: to spark a desire for the pursuit of knowledge and equip students with the lifelong capabilities to sustain it. The way a school conducts its orientation programs is a good lens to start seeing that seed sprout.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

69646|~|Perfecting our opinions|~|   October 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|I have no opinions. Well, I should qualify that statement. I have an abundance of opinions, but I have very few opinions that I feel comfortable articulating outside the realm of writing. While my voice in size 12 font is often stronger than I thought it capable, I find myself lost in bouts of verbal sparring that require well-constructed arguments, rather than sarcastic jabs. From precepts to dining hall debates, my mind seems unwilling to grant itself some acknowledgment of its own worth. Much has been said on the matter of more generational trends, in which we find ourselves mired in pluralism to the point where strong convictions are few and far between. I don’t seek to directly add to this discourse, for there are others who have studied these matters much more in depth than I could ever hope to. In my exploration of the matter as a whole, I’ve drawn mostly upon anecdotal evidence. The most striking of such stories came to me from a teacher of mine, who, on the first day of class, recounted her history as a painfully shy student, unable to make even the simplest of points in class. She went on to say that she felt sympathy for those of us plagued by similar trepidations but that she expected all of us to participate regardless. She now sees the value in everyone’s voice, including her own, as a result of a personal transformation in graduate school. Perhaps everyone needs to simply experience this personal transformation for himself or herself. Perhaps some people will never experience this and will instead be caught up in self-doubt and self-quieting habits. I hope the latter to be simply a pessimistic musing, but it is a possibility. I do believe, however, that the perfectionistic tendencies I know are ever-present in my own personality and those of many of the individuals here don’t help. I, personally, have been raised to believe that any of my many hopes and dreams can happen should I work hard enough, should I give it my best. Somehow, my brain has translated this into a rhetoric revolving around the word “perfect” — those dangerous two syllables that we all know to be an illusion and a societal construct but that many of us still chase after nonetheless and that feeds into the trend of feelings of inadequacy that plagues the University and many other institutions. And so, I suppose, this is less a discussion of a lack of opinions, but rather a criticism of the ambiguous construct of perfectionism, specifically with regard to our opinions. Thoughtfulness, thinking one’s argument through and refraining from a discussion because one doesn’t know enough about the subject are a group of things in and of themselves that are positive and should be encouraged, but there needs to be more of a discussion on campus that it’s fine — good, even — to be wrong or not say something in the exact “right way” every time. We all know this, of course, but how often do we discuss it? How often do we repeat this to ourselves and actually listen? In my case, close to never. A great deal has been said on the value of rejection, especially in the wake of a new round of club applications, rush and other similar events. Somehow, a similar discourse needs to begin with regards to “getting it wrong.” Not necessarily failing on a grand scale, but microcosms of failure. By this, I mean perhaps raising a hand in seminar despite your opinion being a little underdeveloped to allow the entire class the opportunity to work through an idea together. Maybe piping up in a conversation with friends and risking sounding a little stupid is a way to learn from the people around you. Don’t be thoughtless, but once in a while, allow yourself permission to be bold and to say something, even if you don’t know where you’re going with it.|~| Kelly Hatfield is a sophomore from Medford, Mass.

69643|~|Princeton could use more beginners|~|   October 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Max Grear|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|College, we are told, is the time to try new things; finding the opportunities, resources and like-minded adventurous peers who abound around campus is only a matter of showing up to a meeting or striking up conversation with an upperclassman. Princeton, a place where opportunities and resources are especially plentiful, should, by all rights, encourage one to find a new interest, hobby or even passion. However, in my admittedly brief but pivotal first few weeks here, I have noticed a general lack of interest in experimenting with new extracurricular activities. This lack of interest and fear of failure — not only among freshmen but also among our student body as a whole — create a discouraging atmosphere for those who do wish to try something new. Every one of us at the University comes in already having developed strong academic and nonacademic abilities. Naturally, we choose to continue developing these skills. It is understandable that, when forced for the sake of time management to prioritize activities, we usually choose academics and other interests in which we are already invested. However, I think that most of us have room to fit in a new interest with our academic schedules and extracurricular commitments at one point or another. In my first few weeks, a time in which freshmen begin classes and get involved in extracurriculars for the first time, I have noticed that only a relatively small group of people get involved in something unrelated to the skills they developed in high school, and those new activities are limited mainly to non-audition dance or a cappella groups and intramural sports. That’s not to say that there aren’t opportunities for beginners to get involved in new things. As I mentioned before, there are many non-audition groups that include dance, a cappella and improv, as well as intramural sports teams and civic engagement groups. But relatively few students take advantage of these options. This helps create an atmosphere that, if not hostile, is discouraging to beginners. I have heard disparaging comments made about groups designed for beginners as well as fears about being a beginner in a discipline that other people have already seemed to master. The costs to being a beginner include condescension from some more experienced students and exclusion from most (some would say nearly all) of the opportunities for performance and travel. And what if you’re looking to explore something new that falls outside the confines of the “beginner-friendly” groups on campus? Debate, for example, is limited to the highly competitive debate team. There seems to be similarly few opportunities in theater for those who want to try acting for the first time. These are only a couple of examples of the areas that are very difficult for beginners to enter. In these areas, only the most determined students won’t be dissuaded from changing their minds and sticking with whatever is comfortable. It’s an obvious cliché to say that Princeton students are afraid to fail, having always been successful before. Nonetheless, many of us do not seem too concerned about falling into this stereotype. I heard one freshman talk about how he is too intimidated to try learning a new instrument, explaining that he always hears incredible music coming from practice rooms and knows that whatever sound he makes will be embarrassing in comparison. This is an unhealthy but pervasive attitude: that beginning efforts at learning something new will be judged harshly by peers. This fear is too often confirmed by the discouraging comments that some students make about groups geared for beginners. Failure is best experienced collectively. When many students try extracurricular activities, they create a low-pressure, encouraging community in which to experience failure. This experience often lowers the individual ego and fosters a more collective, collaborative spirit. This is something that undoubtedly exists in places on campus, but many students are uninterested or unsure of how to find them. This is why the Princeton community would benefit from a little more adventurous spirit. It would become a more encouraging place for people to try new things and, in so doing, open students up to different ways of learning, thinking, expressing themselves, staying fit, building relationships and maintaining humility. Especially as a place where ego sometimes runs high, Princeton could use more beginners.|~|Max Grear is a freshman from Wakefield, R.I. He can be reached at mgrear@princeton.edu.

69535|~|Editorial: Bring back the Wilson School certificate |~|   October 5 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Over the past two years the Wilson School has seen large changes to its programs. As the school has moved away from its status as Princeton’s only selective major, students have seen requirements added, task forces changed and the end of the certificate program. Many of these changes were initially necessary to accommodate the shift away from selectivity. However, the Editorial Board believes that some are no longer needed. In particular, the Board believes the Wilson School should work to create a new certificate program that would allow students to obtain a certificate in a specific policy area and participate in a task force in that policy area. The Board feels that a Wilson School certificate program would benefit the student body in two key ways. Firstly, a certificate program would allow students to participate in one of Princeton’s most unique educational experiences without having to concentrate in the Wilson School. Task forces present students with a unique opportunity to interact with practitioners in a specific field and to learn how professionals in the field think about the solutions to specific policy questions. Under the previous certificate program, task forces were not limited to Wilson School concentrators and allowed qualified students from other majors to benefit from the inherently unique experience. We think that policy education is potentially valuable to Princeton students and that the University should work with the Wilson School to provide it to all qualified students. Secondly, allowing Wilson School certificate students to participate in task forces would improve the quality of these seminars. Including students in other concentrations would add qualified students and improve the diversity of views presented in the task forces. Policy discussion is inherently interdisciplinary, and the addition of students from other concentrations could broaden discussion and improve the quality of the Wilson School experience for all students. The Board realizes that this policy would increase demand for task forces and could further stretch the resources of the Wilson School. But we also believe that if a certificate was available, the Wilson School’s resources would be potentially less strained as many potential concentrators may choose other departments and instead supplement with the certificate, thus not overwhelmingly increasing demand beyond what Princeton has the resources to responsibly provide.  Furthermore, the certificate program could be made selective both to limit demand and to ensure that only qualified students who would add to the program are admitted. We feel that this would adequately limit demand while still allowing qualified students with an interest in policy to benefit from one of the most valuable policy training experiences that Princeton offers. We encourage both the University and the Wilson School to bring back the certificate program.

69529|~|Is college truly our time to be free?|~|   October 5 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Sakha|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|If you’d asked me two weeks ago what I expected of college, I certainly would not have said crooning “Wagon Wheel” in the company of people donning “Rage with Romney” bro tanks and American-flag Chubbies, and then pledging allegiance to an American flag hung on one wall of a cramped dorm on 9/11 (it should be noted that no one was sober in that room). I would never have foreseen my attending a pregame for the College Republicans during Freshman Week, trying to dodge fireballs in clamorous political discourse over Fireball. I should mention that I’m not actually a Republican. In fact, I’m a Democrat – and a zealous one at that. Why would a right-minded, left-wing individual attend a right-wing pregame? Does that make me a closet libertarian? A rebel? A political spy? A party animal? Well, none of the above. I, just like myriads of other incoming college freshmen, was simply reveling in the newfound freedoms offered by college. Among these liberties is the freedom to not only pregame, but to also pregame with the opposite political party. But that’s certainly not everyone’s conception of “freedom.” Maybe some people’s idea of freedom is pregaming with the College Democrats. And maybe some aren’t even looking to join a political group on campus, let alone go to a pregame with one. All of us came here with certain preconceptions about college, most notably that it entails greater freedom. I, for one, certainly did. As the only child of immigrant parents, college connoted more than freedom from having to eat my vegetables or make my bed or clean my hamsters’ cage. It meant more than the freedom to choose my own classes – as well as the freedom to skip class. It meant more than the freedom to date and party and pregame political meetings. College meant autonomy and independence. Here was my opportunity to create an identity for myself discrete from that which had always been envisioned for me by pursuing repressed passions and interests. College meant freedom of speech, press and religion. College meant the freedom to no longer have to make anyone else but myself proud. While these freedoms may be esoteric to some, these preconceptions we bear in mind about college turn out to be misconceptions. The expectations of the freedom to explore arcane subjects, try out ballroom dancing or continue playing an instrument that you’ve been playing for the past thirteen years of your life — those are misconceptions. “No experience needed,” they said. “Try new things,” they said. “You can do anything,” they said. They lied. It’s all a perverted game of deception. Prior experience may not be needed, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. And when you’re surrounded by multitudes of Monets, Mozarts and Mannings, that hope of freedom and of finding your niche dwindles. Princeton is not the realization of freedom. In fact, it’s the repression of freedom. An inherently elitist culture adds a degree of exclusivity to everything, be it an eating club or club soccer. So is college really as free as we’d thought it to be? Parents “have” to nag you, laundry still has to be done, fruits and vegetables still have to be eaten (more or less). Certain classes must be taken, a path expected to be followed to get into graduate school. And so many — too many — clubs require an application to participate. Now that we’re here, it turns out we may not have innumerable freedoms, and we just may get rejected from every club, organization and position we apply for. Inevitably we may feel discouraged and dejected, blinded by a culture of elitism on campus. But we shouldn’t let this sense of disillusionment hinder us from looking to some of the freedoms that we do have. As for me, I attended a pregame sober with people from the opposite political affiliation — what will you do in the search for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness on campus?|~|Sarah Sakha is a freshman from Scottsdale, Ariz.

69501|~|Distinguishing between difficulties |~|   October 5 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The other day in the dining hall, I overheard a group of students exchanging academic horror stories much like old soldiers sharing their battle wounds. “Four all-nighters in two weeks! Wow, the worst I ever had to do was three.” “Well I have two p-sets and an essay due tomorrow morning, but I’ve only started on one of them. Looks like I’ll have to pull another sleepless night.” They wore their tribulations as badges of honor, and their half-smiling, half-grimacing faces told of their grudging pride in their own resilience. Yet their bloodshot eyes, pallid skin and weary expressions belied a different truth, attesting to the weariness and exhaustion that lay suppressed under the façade of bravado. It is all too easy, as a result of our immersion into Princeton’s culture, to feel that we must be perpetually struggling, or else we are not truly getting the whole “college experience.” I’ve only had to pull a few all-nighters during my time here (the grueling nights leading up to the R3 deadline for Writing Seminar come unbidden and unwelcome to mind), but from talking to peers and overhearing enough conversations, it becomes fairly obvious Princeton students share a common, borderline obsession with our struggles. Frequently, though, waxing poetic about our difficulties is merely an outlet, an easy rationale, to explain and justify problems that are, more often than not, self-imposed. Ironically, after berating their professors for giving them so much work in such a short span of time, another group of students then started to talk about their plans to go to the Street later that night. Or to watch a movie. Or to go for a run. All instead of finishing the problem set they were just complaining about. I’m not in any way condoning a cessation of all extracurricular activities on campus, nor am I suggesting that we as students should wholly devote the entirety of our time to purely academic pursuits. Nor am I even saying that talking about our struggles with each other is negative. Far from it. It gives us common ground, and it can be reassuring to know that others are facing similar difficulties as the rest of us. However, I do think that we should be able to more clearly differentiate between real struggles and self-imposed ones. Having a friend sympathize with your arduous workload is inherently different from crying for attention — because, after all, when we brag about our struggles, what else are we trying to achieve if not attention? In this way, bearing our struggles front and center has become our method of vindicating our efforts and attracting consolation from others to reassure ourselves that, yes, we are really doing our best, given the circumstances. It has also devolved into an informal metric that we use to gauge our relative levels of struggle against each other (with “no all-nighters” being at the bottom of the struggle-o-meter and “no sleep for the past week” being at the top). Overall, it’s acceptable to struggle — we are at one of the greatest (and, ostensibly, one of the most difficult) schools in the world, and it’s fine to share our challenges with each other. However, it is equally important to distinguish between difficulties that are the consequences of our own actions and ones that are truly the result of unforeseen, unavoidable, random circumstances. Taking undue pride in the burdens we overcome can easily send the wrong message — that our struggles are unavoidable obstacles that we managed to successfully conquer, when in reality many such struggles are the consequences of our own decisions. Finding school difficult is fine, but there should be a limit to how much pride we take in such difficulties and in how much culpability we avoid for these same difficulties.|~|Jason Choe is a sophomore from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

69353|~|Editorial: Offer more current events courses |~|   October 2 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The Office of the Registrar’s add/drop deadline marks the time when students begin to reflect on their course load, thinking about what courses they should take in the future, and what they would have done differently if they could return to the first few weeks of September and re-enroll in classes. The University works to satisfy students by offering a rich selection of courses, academic advising and a two-week shopping period. The Editorial Board acknowledges the University’s efforts to make course selection easy, but believes there is a major area in which the University can improve: the availability of courses with a regional focus addressing current events. The Board believes that the University should do more to encourage faculty with regional expertise to design courses that, while still exploring historical factors, analyze current events.   Princeton offers many world-class foreign language programs, which all A.B. students are required to participate in and many B.S.E. students choose to. Language learning has many benefits in a globalized world, chief among them an ability to gain insight into the politics and affairs of people and countries around the world. The Wilson School, for example, includes an extra language requirement for the major for this very reason. The Board, however, finds it extremely disappointing that students who develop proficiency or fluency in a language, in or out of the Wilson School, find limited opportunities to build on this skill in complementary social science courses. Students enrolled in Mandarin Chinese, for example, often cite Wilson School Professor Thomas Christensen’s “China’s Foreign Policies” course offered in the Spring as one of the few courses offered at the University that explores the politics of modern China. This is in spite of the fact that the Mandarin Chinese department is a prominent language program on campus.   The Board also believes that offering the recommended courses would encourage diversity in the classroom. Students naturally gravitate toward courses with which they have a degree of familiarity or which view as highly applicable to daily life. The Board believes that contemporary courses are more likely to meet these criteria for a broad cross-section of the student body than courses that analyze a decade of a country’s history. Precepts that contain an assorted mix of majors often produce the most thoughtful discussion, and the University should consider fostering these classrooms as an important goal. One might object to this, arguing that course enrollment is a zero-sum game and that students will be less likely to take cultural and historical courses. The Board, however, views students taking these courses and developing new interests in the history and culture of foreign nations as a distinct possibility. Furthermore, the Board does not see a compelling reason to corral students into certain courses, when more popular courses can equally further students’ liberal arts education. In some instances, a historical or cultural class could appropriately be a mandatory prerequisite for a particular current events-focused course. Overall, the Board sees no compelling reason not to, and many compelling reasons in favor of a current course catalog with more contemporary based courses.  |~|
69363|~|Restricting the elite|~|   October 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|Nobody is going to argue that Ivy League schools aren’t exclusive. We all feel a sense of pride being here, precisely because it’s such a challenge to get to this point. However, is there such a thing as too exclusive? On this point, I have seriously conflicting emotions. On one hand, exclusivity is what makes schools like Princeton so great. A small population of dedicated and qualified students matched with a small group of the best professors and scholars ensures the very best education.  Yet, I look back to many of my friends from high school and think, am I really so much better than they are? Do I really deserve this education more than my peers? Now, I could go on and on about the feelings of inadequacy at this school, but that’s really not my point here. Rather, my point is that plenty of other equally qualified students are missing this opportunity. Assuming the Office of Admission was able to perfectly separate the top 2,000 students to accept –  which is obviously impossible – there would still be thousands of students capable of finding success here who ultimately must be turned away. Unfortunately, these schools are only getting more exclusive. David Leonhardt wrote an excellent piece for The New Yorker last spring titled “Reasons for Hope While Applying to College” detailing the rapidly increasing difficulty of gaining acceptance into an Ivy League school, especially for American students. There are many reasons for this, including higher acceptance of foreign students and an increase in the college age population. So, how have Ivy League schools responded to the increased tension of school admissions? Well, in many cases, they simply haven’t responded at all. Over the last decade, the total number of students per class at the University has increased by less than 100 students each year, while acceptance rates have simultaneously plummeted. Similar trends have occurred at other Ivy League schools. Each spring we see a new set of record low acceptance rates from top institutions. I don’t necessarily think that exclusivity is inherently bad, as it leads to great institutions like the University. Still, I can’t help but contemplate the consequences for the vast majority of students who don’t get the same opportunity that I have. In an ideal world, everyone who wanted to would be able to pursue higher education, everyone would follow the profession of their dreams, and everybody would be happy with their accomplishments, but I know that’s an absurd idea. When contemplating the American dream, there is a very real distinction between the ideas that anyone can and everyone can, the former of course being the realistic end goal of social equality. However, many people erroneously believe the latter to be what we are all working toward. We don’t want everyone to become doctors, right? Any discussion exploring elite institutions like Ivy League schools has to consider the fact that, by nature, they strive to only admit top-tier students. This disparity is necessary to validate success and reward hard work. In the same breath, there comes a point where the number of qualified students becomes so high and the number of spaces in universities so relatively low that gaining acceptance becomes a crapshoot. Why should we put such restrictions on qualified students? These are students with the potential to support the economy, push scientific discovery and change the world. Again, I concede that higher education is not for everyone. However, the overwhelming restriction universities currently place on qualified students is no better. There has to be a middle ground. So what is the solution? Firstly, I think the Ivies should make a concerted effort to accept more students. This obviously has unwanted consequences, such as less faculty attention and lower financial aid per student.  But are we so absorbed in our own exclusivity and success that the thought of extending the University’s opportunities to more students seems so absurd?  In the long term, I think there have to be more substantial changes in the way the United States handles higher education. For now, Princeton is a unique and special place, and I personally want as many people as possible to share this opportunity. Don’t you?|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a computer science major from Pittsburgh, Pa. He can be reached at cjw5@princeton.edu.

69327|~|It’s okay to be unhappy|~|   October 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|If I could sit my freshman self down at the dawn of my Princeton career, I’d have quite a few things to say. Don’t take that 9 a.m. class. Get your quantitative reasoning requirement done early. Try out for everything. Attend every lecture. Go pick up your favorite sweater from the laundry room right now because it will get stolen. However, all of these little things would only come after I told her the one thing I truly wish someone had said to me. I would take poor, frightened me by the shoulders and say, “Give college six months before you decide how you feel.” I came to Princeton somewhat unwillingly. I had wanted to go to a smaller school further from home, and Princeton Preview had been a rather unpleasant experience. Princeton was the best choice, though, and I prepared myself to don the orange and black all the same. I met wonderful people those first few months, joined clubs, picked interesting classes and navigated the Street with a mixture of awe and curiosity. I didn’t hate it, as I had expected I would, but I also didn’t love it. I felt like I was at Princeton, but not a part of it. In my naive mind, college was the great peak of one’s life — but those first couple of months simply did not feel like they were set to be the pinnacle of mine. On Facebook, my friends were posting photos of wild parties and large groups of friends arm-in-arm, the epitome of instant best friends. Those people, I thought, were really enjoying college. I, on the other hand, was still finding my footing. When fall break came around, I could not wait to go home. My friends came together and told their great college stories, each attempting to outdo the other. I, too, had stories to tell, and from these no one could have known that I was still not thrilled about Princeton. I only realized much later that we were all playing the same game — everyone was putting on a brave, but not quite honest, face. However, at the time, all I could think was that perhaps I had made the wrong choice in school. Perhaps I should be elsewhere. Sometime between fall break and winter break, something changed. One day, I realized that I hadn’t thought about how happy I was in a while, because I just was. Happiness at Princeton had snuck up on me. I wish I could put my finger on the thing that did it, but I’m not so sure that I can. It may have simply been a growing comfort with college life or that my roots finally took hold. It may have been that my relationships had gotten stronger or my definition of “home” had shifted. I do know that as fall passed into winter, I unconsciously fell in love with Princeton. I was in exactly the right place. I tell this to all the freshmen who will listen, regardless of whether they go to Princeton or elsewhere. In fact, I told this to the nice, wide-eyed freshman boy who joined me in Rockefeller Dining Hall last week. It’s the one thing that people don’t seem to tell you, and yet I think it’s the most important — you don’t have to be happy right away, and most people aren’t. I had two friends transfer from their respective schools at the end of their first semester. One of these girls was the same one whose photos crowded my newsfeed with depictions of the seemingly perfect college experience — lots of friends, parties, trips into the City, a date to every event — but she was miserable, and so, too, it turns out, were many of my friends who needed more than a couple months to adjust. As you grow up, college is held up as this wonderful, freeing oasis, and, thus, when you are thrust into it, you expect it to be as such from the start. When it’s not, there’s a sense that you’ve done something wrong because no one wants to admit that reality has not quite matched up to reputation. These first few weeks are a false indicator of what college is like. The fast pace of freshman week, tryouts, rush, shopping classes and endless meetings keep freshmen too busy to really think about whether or not they’re happy here. However, as the dust settles over the next month or so, the thought may creep up. There’s nothing wrong with that. This is why I say, give it six months — not two or three. It seems like a painfully long time, but that truly is how long it took me to find my footing. There may even be some students who need the year to really get a sense of how they feel about Princeton. Either way, do not deny yourself the opportunity to fall in love with this place by abiding by an imagined time frame or comparing yourself to others’ apparent college experience. Princeton has been wonderful, difficult, enlightening and stressful. It has been the site of my greatest highs and lows, and I wouldn’t give it up for anything. Freshman me would never have expected that. However, six months make all the difference, and three years later you might be happy you gave it a real chance, too.|~|Chelsea Jones is an English major from Ridgefield, Conn.

69197|~|Helping (in theory)|~|   October 1 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Taking the rush hour train across Midtown always seemed to show me the best of the city. The indescribable odors. The sweat created from the unbearable sauna-like heat. The people who would not shut up on their cellphones. Huddled together, you could not shake the eerie feeling that you were just one of a pack of sardines. Gotta love people. Especially this many people. Clutching my backpack to my chest with one arm, I awkwardly reached out to a railing, trying my best to avoid any unnecessary physical contact. Each commute became a physical feat, tightly gripping the cold metal pole for physical support, while the arm contorts itself into new and awkward angles to avoid bulky purses and sweaty backs. But for a second, stuck in the sea of anxious coffee-deprived commuters jam-packed into a metal tin buried hundreds of feet beneath the ground, I almost appreciated being here. Granted, I did not appreciate the cramped space nor the humidity, but I did appreciate the solitude. Despite being surrounded on all sides, gazing out of the window into the blackness of the underground abyss, I was completely alone with my thoughts. It was just… “Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,” groaned a middle-aged heckler who attempted to stand up on one of the flimsy plastic seats. “I have a family to feed…” “Great,” I thought, instinctually shifting my gaze to the pole to avoid accidental eye contact. That way, I could feign ignorance – maybe my iPhone was playing music too loudly to hear or the train car had lousy acoustics. It created doubt, an excuse for being ignorant. And an excuse was all I needed to sleep soundly at night. And in a way, wasn’t it okay to ignore him? He didn’t have to ruin everyone’s commute by standing up, showing off his grime-coated person, and getting in our faces for money. I didn’t even need to hear the rest, I already thought I knew: “He wasn’t a functioning member of society. And anyways, what could I do? He was beyond saving.” At the time I felt completely justified in my ignorance and contempt. I had no money to give. Here I was trying to make something of myself, trying to prepare for a career with an unpaid internship – while this man was resorting to begging on a subway. But later, I realized I was a complete asshole. In the classroom only months earlier, it seemed so easy to agree with the multiple political philosophers we read who derided vast economic inequality. Sure, we don’t have to give until global marginal benefits and costs are equal, like Peter Singer has proposed. But with people living on the streets, hell, something was clearly wrong in the world and it was up to us to fix it. It is easy to be a hero in theory. But now, faced with an actual person, when it should have been the easiest to look into his eyes, empathize with his pain and find that extra dollar in my pocket, my hands didn’t budge. Frozen, I just stared blankly into the pole. Often, we believe that our problem is that we are too quick to objectify those in need — we disconnect them from our reality and, in the process, make it easier to dehumanize and ignore them. Yet here,was a person with a face, a name, a family, that I could see, hear and smell, and I sympathized with him less than any one of the thousands of theoretical people in my ethics’ books. The problem wasn’t that he wasn’t real enough — he clearly was. Rather, it appeared, that something was wrong with me. But after all, I’m not a heartless monster (at least hopefully not; although by this point some of you may seriously be questioning that). Hundreds of other people had ignored him as well. It seems all too easy to serve in one minute, and be dismissive in the next. In a world where we are constantly bombarded with time constraints, goals and things to remember, we run the risk of compartmentalization. We focus so much on whatever we are doing in the moment that we shrug off any bump, seeing it as an inconvenience, regardless of the cost. We’ve all had these thoughts, yet many among us constantly seek to help others, whether it is through the Prison Teaching Initiative, Big Sibs or some other program. It’s not that we are flawed or truly hold derision for others. It’s that we’re busy. And while it’s not ideal, it’s natural. However, in light of this, we need to make a persistent effort to be cognizant of others. Stepping back for a second to make sure that we are not being that asshole on the subway like I was is a great step in the right direction.|~|Ben Dinovelli is a Wilson School major from Mystic, Conn.

69163|~|Keep misandry out of feminism|~|   October 1 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Newby Parton|~|   Columnist     |~|I am a feminist, so the first words I spoke at a recent town hall meeting on the new sexual assault procedures were in praise of the University’s speedy response to the new Title IX regulations. Victims of sexual assault will now have a clearer understanding of their options. They can be advised by outside counsel at meetings. Professional investigator-judges have replaced student judges, so victims can step forward without embarrassment. Our compliance marks a huge victory for women on campus, and we’re all better off as a result. I voiced a single worry at the town hall meeting: that the new “preponderance of the evidence” standard will, definitionally, increase the likelihood of false convictions. Unknowingly, I had struck a hole into a dam. Cries of “rape culture” spewed forth. Let me take a detour to explain that I do not mean to protect rapists. Nor do I mean to paint false accusations to be a common occurrence. They’re not. A 1997 investigation by the US Department of Justice found that only about 8 percent of rape accusations are false. This figure is contested on both sides, with some asserting a lower rate of 2 percent and a peer-reviewed study by criminologist Eugene Kanin finding a rate as high as 41 percent. Regardless of which statistic comes closest to the truth, false reports are the minority. I should also make this clear: I am not writing to lament the lower evidence standard. Its institution is federally mandated, and it’s here to stay. Instead I write about a greater concern that those at the town hall pressed upon me. To articulate that concern, I must return to the discussion that took place there. A student who spoke after me argued that the “preponderance” standard is necessary because evidence in a rape case is inherently shaky. If a victim steps forward a month after the rape, there may not be any evidence at all. This is a consideration I sympathize with. However, the belief between the lines — that verbal testimony alone should be enough to convict an accused perpetrator — worries me. So too do the finger quotes that female speakers slashed into the air when they spoke about “rights of the accused.” Their meaning was clear and powerful: Accused men do not have rights, and the best way to fight rape culture is to presume men guilty until proven innocent. The truth is that, as with any crime, false accusations do happen. Maybe my worry — that these new and valuable victories will come at the cost of false convictions — is misplaced. Maybe mistakes will be rare enough that the benefit of suspending more rapists will outweigh the cost of suspending more innocent people. I don’t know, and neither does anyone else. What I do know is that this same worry affects other men. Here is my great concern: The input from worried men was not received kindly at the town hall. Rather, I was accused of being “steeped in rape culture.” My accuser was not alone in her belief, for her comment set off an avalanche of smug glances aimed in my direction. Buried there, I did not dare speak again — my ideas were not welcome. But this is an important conversation, and all ideas should be heard. A few women have turned the dialogue into a battle against men and women, and in doing so I fear that they will turn men away from feminism. Men feel marginalized when our worries about a real, higher risk of wrongful suspension are disregarded. Attributing these worries to rape culture only distances us further because we begin to think that this is what feminism has become — a bias against males that mistakes all male viewpoints for oppression. Treating an accused perpetrator as innocent until he is found guilty can be an outgrowth of human decency, not rape culture. Similarly, the belief that men are guilty until proven innocent is misandry, not feminism. Keeping the two separate is important. Feminism is the struggle to reach equality for the sexes. It is not misandry, a bias against males. Sadly, many men forget this because misandrists never identify as such. They will tell you they are simply feminists. Conflating feminism and misandry like this hurts women as much as it hurts men. Men suffer when misandry is codified, and women suffer by losing male support for the noble goals of feminism. We must remember that this is not a battle of the sexes. Men, remember that feminism means equality — not misandry. Women, remember that men are not an enemy entrenched in rape culture. For that matter, remember that rape culture does not exist as misandrists might imagine it. According to a 2002 study, 94 percent of men have never raped and will never rape anyone. We shun sexual assault with the same fervor as women do, for we are allies working toward the same goal. That goal can be realized only if we work together, and for more men to work with us, feminism must shed the misandrist beliefs that hide under its name.|~|Newby Parton is a freshman from McMinnville, Tenn.

69186|~|Teaching how to learn|~|   October 1 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jonathan Lu|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Coming into Princeton, I knew I wanted to get involved with community service. At the Activities Fair, I spent most of my time under the Pace Center for Civic Engagement tent. Every table seemed to advertise tutoring opportunities, but few required experience. Representatives from several of the groups told me that the Pace Center is planning on holding more training workshops for tutors this year. The introduction of more, and potentially different, tutor training raises the question: What is good tutoring? In high school, I worked as a geometry tutor. My student’s father hired me to be her tutor during her freshman year. She was a good student. She paid attention in lecture and asked questions when she didn’t understand. She took thorough notes on every lesson, and was always excited to learn. Teaching her was fulfilling. Yet once the next school year started, I learned that she was searching for another tutor. Now she needed help with Algebra II and chemistry. I felt like a failed tutor. I wasn’t bothered by the fact that she needed help. I was bothered by the idea of her always depending on a tutor to explain every new subject. In today’s volatile world, new skills and paradigms constantly arise. She can’t depend on someone to always be there to walk her through new concepts. School teaches us material, but it should also teach how to learn. Bad tutoring can kill that skill. Tutoring may place too much of a burden on the tutor to teach and not enough on the student to learn. When my father taught me algebra at home during elementary school, I could simply sit back and let him explain everything. My father would ask me questions to engage me. Sometimes I was too lazy to respond. After an awkward pause, Dad would explain the answers in the end. I became accustomed to this constant feedback. When I began learning on my own, I checked the answers whenever I was faced with a problem I couldn’t do in five seconds. I was afraid of situations I hadn’t seen before. As a tutor, I taught through the same one-sided lectures — it seemed natural for me to simply explain all of the material. Yet I found that tutoring style inadequate. My student could listen as though her life depended on it, but she always seemed completely lost when we moved to a new concept. Real learning requires ownership and discovery, both of which entail struggle. The one- or two- hour space of a tutoring session eliminates the opportunity to struggle. Both the tutor and student see even the slightest confusion as a failure to be quickly remedied by a neat explanation. No one trusts the student to reason it out herself. This isn’t to say that all tutoring is bad — everyone needs help at some point. Rather, it means the tutor shouldn’t help the student every single step of the way. Teaching the answer before the student sees the question is absurd. What is good tutoring? Good tutoring should supplement good learning. The best learning comes from experiences. Building projects, essays, speeches and challenge problems. These learning experiences require failure. Students won’t remember “SOHCAHTOA”, but they’ll remember trying to use angles to measure the distance between two cities on a map. They won’t remember being told to outline their ideas; they’ll remember getting halfway through an essay and being completely lost about what to say next. Here is the tutor’s biggest challenge: He must believe in the student’s ability. He must show the student that those wayward ideas, those dead ends, that unfinished concluding paragraph prove that the student is growing. He must always be positive, but never complacent. This isn’t to say that tutors should leave the students completely lost. But instead of spoon-feeding material, the tutor must guide the student in approaching new situations. Outline ideas. Write down all the information. Look at trivial cases. And finally, focus on the skills the material teaches. History teaches us to construct arguments. Chemistry trains us to look at control variables and limiting factors. Math teaches us to play with abstract ideas. This model only works if both the tutor and student are invested in the learning. The tutor must show that the material merits the effort. How is this fun? Why does this matter? The student must be willing to work on the material independently at some point. Students doesn’t need to understand everything immediately, but it’s important for them to take ownership of their learning. In “The Flat World and Education: How America’s Commitment to Equity Will Determine Our Future”, Linda Darling Hammond describes an educational study that randomly assigned at-risk seventh graders to remedial, average and honors math classes. It found that those assigned to honors classes, with the more demanding and engaging curriculum, outperformed all other students from similar backgrounds. While the other classes focused on teaching rote skills, memorization, and test-oriented tasks, the honors classes allowed the students to synthesize, draw connections, and make the material their own. “Honors” is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Tutoring should be honors: it should believe kids are smart enough not just to consume facts, but to use them. Tutoring shouldn’t leave students unsupported, but it should strive to make them completely independent. The kids will rise to that expectation. Pace Center groups should train their tutors in the image of this ideal tutor: personable, engaging and, most of all, believing. We best serve lower-performing youth by expecting more of them and giving them ownership of their learning. Give a kid an answer, and you help him with one question. Teach a kid to think, and you help him for a lifetime.|~|Jonathan Lu is a freshman from Fremont, Calif. He can be reached at jhlu@princeton.edu. 
69154|~|How we view diversity at Princeton|~|   September 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Erica Choi|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The week we, the freshman class, marched through FitzRandolph Gate, we were bombarded with activities that initiated the four-year-long journey that will be our Princeton careers. Some of them instilled the expectations the University has of us, some set the tone and others acknowledged the problems that exist on Princeton’s campus. The diversity talk — “Reflections on Diversity” — falls under the third category with its discussion of sexual and racial differences and the challenges differences present here on campus. While the University did a good job with the former, I found the latter to be rather flavorless due to its emphasis on polarity. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, but I moved to New York seven years ago. Since then, I have been living in a beautiful, middle-class suburbia that is noteworthy for its homogeneity and WASP-yness. There was not a single black person in my high school, and there were only 10 Asians, including myself. I still loved my one square mile of a town. But I am painfully aware of the fact that I have not been exposed to the full spectrum of the American experience. It is a continuing struggle for me to expand upon my limited interaction with diversity, especially racial diversity. I wanted the diversity talk to introduce the wide variety of experiences at the University. In this respect, the diversity talk did not meet my hopes. I listened to speeches that were, literally and rhetorically, very much focused on the black and white. Literally speaking, there was a glaring underrepresentation of any race other than white or black. All panelists discussed the African-American experience. (There was one white, Jewish panelist, but she too spoke about her work on the topic of what it means to be an African-American male in America.) In favor of discussing the dichotomy, they neglected East Asians, Indians, Hispanic, etc. It was as though only African-American and white students existed at Princeton, as though the struggle of an Indian-American in this country, let’s say, isn’t every bit as legitimate. Then, I was reminded of a comment my good friend had made a year or so ago. Racism toward Asians just is not in fashion, he argued. Asians, or so his argument went, have assimilated successfully into the American culture. He even added, all in good humor, that they were whites for all intents and purposes. And he pointed to me — the living evidence of his argument. An Asian girl who lived in Korea until the age of 12, fully assimilated into the stereotypical American suburb. I did not agree with his assessment back then, and I do not agree with it now. But I realized that many people must agree with him, consciously or subconsciously, and view the racial struggle as a clash of two groups, white and black. All other groups are observant nonparticipants. But I want to give a voice to other stories. There are those of us who are not black or white at Princeton. There are also those of us who hail from other backgrounds. There are those of us who struggled. There are those of us, myself included, who were far from the majority in our towns but still felt at home there. My slight Korean accent, my stubborn refusal to eat Pop Tarts (“It’s so gross,” I would exclaim) or, more seriously, my friend’s Hindu beliefs didn’t automatically translate into a struggle. The point is that these are all valid American experiences that should be acknowledged when we talk about diversity. No single person’s experience is representative of a whole group’s. Just because I was blessed and did not face any discrimination even while I lived in one of the more WASP-y towns in the nation doesn’t mean that every Asian girl will feel at home there. I don’t claim to represent the whole; similarly, the diversity panel should not have asserted that the University is a certain way when it comes to a certain race. I want to make it clear that it was through no fault of the panelists themselves that the diversity talk was so lacking in the end. They discussed their valid, personal experiences. But in the future, the University should organize the event in such a way that not all panelists focus on the different experiences of one racial identity. Perhaps what was the most uncomfortable was that in the absence of this acknowledgement, the University missed the entire point of diversity. It didn’t focus on what really matters. Diversity should cover the whole range, not just a couple of points on the spectrum.|~|Erica Choi is a freshman from Bronxville, NY. She can be reached at gc6@princeton.edu. 
69152|~|Accepting rejection|~|   September 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|’Tis the season to be rejected. The acceptance emails and rowdy pickups have maxed out now as student organizations across campus take their pick of the deliciously talented cornucopia of applicants. Egos inflate and implode as students experience the high of finding themselves wanted or the crushing reverse scenario. Freshman roommates navigate their first major relationship obstacle when the lucky one gets serenaded in his room by the same a cappella group that just rejected his new friend. Basically, there are a lot of feelings right now. As a senior, there’s a strong and obnoxious urge to sit back and laugh smugly at the whole process. I’m fairly well set in my commitments at the University, and anything added to my schedule this year will be in the form of open groups or activities not requiring an interview and a love letter to the organization in order to participate. Still, watching the process from the sidelines has been making me think a lot about the breadth and depth of the rejection experience at Princeton, not least because I have several good friends who are on the sending or receiving ends of that unpleasant, polite little message informing students that their extracurricular organization of choice has no room for them at the moment: “Sorry, and see you at auditions next year.” Don’t get me wrong: I’m not against selectivity in student groups. Certain kinds of organizations need to have standards and vision to maintain excellence, and the members who make up their ranks are specifically chosen with the objective of perpetuating the particular character of that group. Besides, the culture of rejection forces many Princeton students to face the fact that they are not desirable to every campus group relevant to their interests, and that kind of humbling revelation has the potential to be very good for us. I say “potential” because Princeton students often deal with rejection in less healthy ways. We have a tendency to take rejection as a heavenly sign of our incompetence or failure in a specific area and subsequently drop the hobby completely. As Princeton students, we have been programmed to value exclusivity and judge merit according to its ethos. If we weren’t, we might not have found the University so appealing in the first place, and we certainly wouldn’t go around gleefully quoting the school’s changing acceptance rates every year. We worship exclusivity and frame our judgments of ability around a sharp dichotomy of “in” versus “out.” As a result, when the powers that be (student boards, play directors, etc.) inform us that we’re not what they were looking for, we treat their decision like the ultimate verdict on our talent. I’ve seen it happen again and again. Students dedicate their high school careers to a specific extracurricular that probably played a central role in their applications to Princeton, only to discover that their years of experience and passion mean squat to the voting members of their favorite theater group. Result: They give up the passion. Competitive student groups, however, are not the only option. They’re simply the most attractive one to the kind of person who has been conditioned to believe that acceptance equals validation. There are communities and events that cater to the specific interests of students who were not accepted into the better known clubs on campus. The Princeton University Band and Lobster Club Improv Comedy are the most celebrated examples, but there are many others slipping under the radar: Sister Speakers: Women’s Open Word, the juggling club and Rise Up, to name a few. These no-audition options often go unexplored because they lack the prestigious and validating authority of an exclusive organization. Once the gods of selectivity have spoken, too many Princeton students decide there’s no point committing time to their writing, playing or acting in any forum. A student who was turned down from Tiger Capital Management, the University’s student-run investment fund, quoted a line from his rejection letter: “This does not reflect on your accomplishments or your investing knowledge, but rather on our organization’s current needs.” This is a pretty classic rejection trope. It might be read as courteous diplomatic garbage — and maybe sometimes it is — but, as often as not, the “It’s not you, it’s us” line is actually true with regards to campus extracurriculars. There are enough talented students at Princeton that groups with limited membership and specific ideas about the kind of image they want to project cannot accept all applicants. If you love dance, don’t let rejection from one or even three selective companies rule it out of your life. Dig around for alternative options that don’t require auditions, and, if none suit your needs or taste, start your own. Otherwise, you’re letting an apologetic email nullify years of commitment to an interest or talent — and that is failure in the true sense of the word.

69149|~|Finding meaning|~|   September 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|You would think the author of an essay titled “Don’t Send Your Kids to the Ivy League” would get a chilly reception in a room of Princeton students. Many of us, however, found ourselves applauding Bill Deresiewicz’s arguments last week as he and Joshua Rothman discussed the book from which the essay is excerpted, “Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life.” On Monday, Cameron Langford deftly defended Princeton from the charge in the first part of the book’s long-winded subtitle — and the University is indeed working to salvage a liberal arts education from the trends Deresiewicz notes. But, as Rothman argued both in a response to Deresiewicz’s essay and at the panel, it is nearly impossible for a college to help us with that second part — the meaningful life. How can we, the products of years of frenzied preparation for college, hope to suddenly find meaning once inside the FitzRandolph Gate? We are universally driven, universally busy and universally good at jumping through hoops. What we lack, Deresiewicz argues, is something that is systematically beaten out of us in the obstacle course to college. We cannot take risks or make any choices that do not bring us closer to the goals we have allowed to be defined for us. The damage to creativity and introspection is crippling. The need to make an experience “count” shades everything. Readings can be interesting, but it’s hard to immerse oneself in their intricacies and take tangents while keeping up with the syllabus. Peers, professors and alumni can be invaluable friends and fonts of wisdom — but all interaction is, to some extent, networking. For me, every weekend trip, every protest, every introspection gets crammed into an 800-word ‘Prince’ column. All of life is focused on moving toward one of a handful of careers — chosen mainly for their qualities as low-risk moves to the next level — and none is focused on finding meaning. Oh, we can rationalize our timid choices. The fledgling doctor wants to save lives, or at least that’s what his parents always told him. Cameron applies to consulting jobs merely as a temporary hiatus from “saving the world.” But if we were really choosing freely, would more than half of us, as Deresiewicz points out, end up on one of four paths — finance, consulting, law and medicine? MCATs, LSATs, GPA cutoffs and internships represent familiar gates to familiar-looking prestigious paths. That Princeton’s “alternative” career fairs are simply defined as excluding finance and consulting shows we have lost perspective. There are exceptions: those who have rejected the hoops. I have a friend who, rather than joining a campus music group to exercise and justify his passion for drumming and music, brought friends together into his own group to do what he wants. When I asked if he felt Princeton pressing him toward an elite definition of success, he was indignant. Somewhere during freshman fall (perhaps under the influence of MAT 215: Honors Analysis), he had decided to stop caring, in the least nihilistic way possible. “I don’t know where I want to be in five years, even two!” he told me. For him, far less than any plan or goal is the feeling that he gets “knowing what [he’s] doing is right,” that he’s spreading his art and ideas. More hopeful than the outliers, though, is that the vast majority of us moving through these hoops feel that something is missing. An operations research and financial engineering major friend told me that she had noticed her personal definition of success change. A job allowing her to support and spend time with her family is no longer enough — she has taken on her peers’ desire for a fast-paced money-and-numbers job. That this worries her shows that all is not lost. We are, despite Deresiewicz’s fears, capable of and willing to question ourselves. For now, then, I’m looking carefully at the hoops I choose. There is nothing wrong with moving toward conventional goals, as long as we do so for the right reasons. For me, inertia and praise were the wrong reasons to keep writing for the ‘Prince.’ Even before Deresiewicz’s talk, I had informed my editor I would take a temporary leave from these pages. I want to live my life without my opinion-columnist blinders on, ever stuffing my life into 800 words. More than that, I want time to think — not as a student or as a columnist, but as a human soul. I have also decided to take a semester abroad this spring. With luck, Europe will do for me what the University has stopped doing — allow me to take stock of my commitments and beliefs. I don’t know where I’m going from here. I still like writing, and I still like solving problems. Moreover, I maintain my drive to know. I’ll probably still go to grad school. But that decision — and any decision I make during or after — will be made deliberately. We must live mindfully and refuse to let inertia and expectations pull us through life, or we can hardly be said to have lived at all. Bennett McIntosh is a chemistry major from Littleton, Colo.

68994|~|Residential college advisers and reporting sexual misconduct|~|   September 29 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|As the University faces an investigation for possible violations of federal law under Title IX, it has directed some of its attention to the role of residential college advisers in new policy changes. In the past, RCAs were not required to report sexual misconduct cases to the directors of student life. However, under the new regulations, RCAs now have to report every case of which they are made aware, even if the victim isn’t one of their advisees. Once a case is reported, the University will conduct a mandatory investigation. While the University’s intended goal is to address sexual violence and harassment on campus, the policy change involving RCAs may discourage sexual assault victims from reporting their cases. According to Jacob Donnelly’s Sept. 25 article on the proposed changes to address concerns brought up by the investigation, the federal government is calling residential college advisers “campus security authorities,” a title that is shared by employees such as campus police, security officers and, by definition, “an official … [with] significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings.” However, RCAs are still students, and a large part of their day doesn’t involve them interacting with their advisees; this new label basically requires them to take on the legal role of a “campus security authority” 24/7, even for students beyond their advisee group. They receive that training because in becoming RCAs they become paid employees of the University. RCAs are individuals with whom advisees and students in general feel comfortable disclosing personal information, especially about something as emotionally distressing as sexual assault. After all, RCAs have specialized training in how to talk to students about cases of sexual misconduct, in addition to other emotional issues. RCAs are better equipped to handle traumatic experiences, such as sexual assault, than students who do not have such training. Therefore, making RCAs “mandatory reporters,” as the Department of Education’s new policy dictates, might take away a fundamental resource from potential victims on campus. RCAs can advise these students who might not feel comfortable filing an official report and can guide them toward helpful, qualified resources such as Counseling and Psychological Services or Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education. Unfortunately, the policy change now states that even students outside an advisee group also have lost the possible resource of an RCA, as even their cases would automatically be disclosed to a director of student life and then the University in an investigation. Many victims might already be hesitant to discuss the trauma of experiencing sexual harassment or violence, especially if they don’t necessarily want their case to result in disciplinary action. Having such a dramatic and formal process of dealing with potential cases might reduce the number of victims who come forth — a counterproductive effect of what is a well-intentioned rule. Furthermore, in discussions with other students, I have heard a couple of them reason that the policy change might not be a huge issue because even SHARE peer advisers have to report alleged instances of sexual misconduct to Director of SHARE Jacqueline Deitch-Stackhouse; therefore, it shouldn’t be a big deal that RCAs have to report similar instances to DSLs. However, there are two key differences: First, the director of SHARE is not required to disclose cases to the University as a DSL would. Reporting to the director of SHARE would not automatically trigger an investigation and possible disciplinary action, whereas reporting to a DSL would. Second, the roles and positions of the two authorities are inherently and dramatically different within the context of student life. I would feel much more comfortable with the director of SHARE knowing about a hypothetical case of sexual assault, as not only do her qualifications address the particular issue of sexual violence and harassment in a college setting, but also her role in my life would be completely separated from other aspects of my Princeton career. Furthermore, the policy seems to be ambiguous on how to handle certain hypothetical situations. For example, what would happen if an RCA overheard two students talking about a third student’s case of sexual misconduct, which did not personally involve them? Is the RCA mandated by the policy to report this case, even though it is hearsay? In this scenario, the policy strips the victim — the student who wasn’t involved in any part of the conversation — of his or her agency, thereby denying the victim of informed consent of disclosure. It’s definitely a step in the right direction to involve students, especially students trained in advising, in reporting and investigative procedures. But if anything, this policy may effectively reduce the number of resources available for students to talk to about sexual assault. With the current concerns surrounding sexual assault on campus, these recent changes seem to be exacerbating the problem, rather than relieving it.|~|Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major from Irvine, Calif.

69032|~|A call for greater transparency in the Lakeside Graduate Housing Project |~|   September 29 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|The University likes to say that it cares about its students’ welfare and concerns. In terms of amenities, support systems and general luxuries, few schools can compete with what the University offers its undergraduate students. Yet for the past six months, many graduate students here have been languishing in a hollow of uncertainty, misinformation and bizarrely ham-fisted treatment. The Lakeside Graduate Housing project, which as recently as last February was set for completion during the summer, has now been delayed for the third time since the start of 2014. The earliest occupancy is now projected for December, although the administration is sending clear signals that it does not expect to hit even that goal. In the meantime, students have been shunted into whatever housing is available, generally units in Butler and Stanworth apartments. Students are now facing a full year of living arrangements that they were told would last only a few months at most. Our primary grievance is the University’s inexplicable lack of transparency. It is difficult to believe that Housing and Real Estate Services reasonably expected Lakeside to be move-in ready at the time of the housing draw last February. A 12-month project overrun seems unlikely to arise without any warning, so it appears that Lakeside was inaccurately advertised. If a realistic timeline had been disclosed up front, many students would have elected to live elsewhere. The process has caused many to lose faith in the trustworthiness of the housing process. Further, not a single general update to Lakeside progress was given between April 18 and Sept. 19. Few options remain. Opportunities to seek off-campus housing were passed over in favor of promised Lakeside occupancy. Even now, the administration’s vacillations mean that students lack the knowledge to make an informed decision on whether or not to wait for improved campus housing. Meanwhile, Butler and Stanworth apartments offer a decreased quality of living, especially in the winter. If the administration feels that Butler is in poor enough condition to warrant immediate demolition, why does HRES feel justified in housing students for an additional year at full cost to the residents? Furthermore, many units have suffered from chronic rodent infestations, peeling paint and slower than usual response times for essential maintenance. Recognizing the above considerations, many graduate students have expressed support for the following requests: 1. An email disclosing specific details of the delays sent to the affected graduate students In the interest of rebuilding trust between HRES and graduate students, we would appreciate an email laying out the nature and causes of the construction delays and a timeline of developments from the past eight months. In particular, we want to know at what points HRES suspected significant delays and why it waited so long to inform us. To date, the administration has not even offered a simple apology. ￼2. Proportional additional free or significantly reduced months of rent The last time a significant delay was announced was April 18, 2014. The email projected a fall move-in process and guaranteed two months of free rent (one month Butler/Stanworth, one month Lakeside) and reimbursed moving costs. For many of us, these financial incentives seemed reasonable given a three-five month delay. However, with the delay now standing at seven-12+ months, they ought to be increased proportionally. 3. A guarantee of equal compensation regardless of housing outcome It is now apparent that many affected graduate students will never move into Lakeside. However, we believe that these students are still entitled to the promised compensation for moving costs, regardless of where the actions of the housing office have caused them to move to. Additionally, several students have been housed in temporary Stanworth units whose monthly rent is significantly greater than rent would have been in the Lakeside units they had been assigned. We believe they do not deserve this additional long-term burden and should be compensated for the difference. The University has put into doubt its commitment to graduate students as full members of its academic community. Absent further mitigating action by HRES, we will not be able to recommend the housing services to prospective graduate students in good faith.|~|Alexander Berg is a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering.

68554|~|New precepts for precepts?|~|   September 29 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ali Akram Hayat|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I found out what a precept was the day before classes were supposed to begin my freshman year. It was during a meeting with my academic adviser, finalizing courses, that the word first went into my ear. I had no idea what it meant. I sought and received an explanation, which focused on differentiating the system from its counterparts elsewhere. It seemed as flimsy that day as it does today. In truth, precepts are not much different from “sections” or “tutorials” at most other colleges, and preceptors are not an upgrade over teaching assistants or assistant instructors. There seems to be a sense of pride and academic superiority attached with the notion of precepts, which, as with most such cases at the University, is not as valid as we think it is. An institution such as ours, with a sterling reputation for its “undergraduate focus” — a term thrown around lazily and extensively — needs a revamp of the precept system, which pervades most large courses and almost all classes in the humanities and social sciences. Why so? There are a number of issues with precepts in their current state. First, graduate students lead an overwhelming majority of them. An obvious implication is that some of them are led by the professor of the class. This creates a great disparity between precept experiences. A student taking the same class as another student in the same semester may have a completely different experience of the class. This is because precepts form a core part of this experience: It is where you get to discuss the lecture, posit questions, engage with other students and really get involved in the course materials. It’s bad enough the professor in charge of the class cannot lead a majority of these discussions, which are instead handled by graduate students without the same level of expertise in the material. What makes it worse is that this reality is only true for some students and not for others. While the obvious solution to this problem would be to increase the number of precepts led by professors (ideally, all of them), it is not feasible. Instead, there should be a rotating system with the professor holding different precepts, evening out his time among them. The same should apply to other preceptors so that the quality of teaching is spread out more evenly among students. Moreover, it would keep students more engaged, as a regular change of preceptors would likely keep students on their toes. The second problem with the precept system is its systematic bias. This arises because many preceptors are also graders, and bias generated from class discussion performance can creep into the grading process, especially for papers and other written assignments. That sounds intuitively wrong. But there’s more: Class performance already makes up a percentage portion of the grade for a variety of classes and is factored in as such. Bias factors in twice, once regularly and then again while grading. Moreover, there seems to be disparity in grading harshness across precepts. How a person grades, especially on assignments for courses without set, scientific answers, depends on a variety of factors, and these can — and do — vary greatly from person to person. Like it or not, grading is a huge part of any educational experience (just refer to the debate on grade deflation and the nearly unanimous cry of support for the report that suggests that it be repealed). It seems unjust that two works of similar quality may possibly be graded differently. A solution to the problems of both bias and grading standard differentials could be anonymous, rotational grading. What this entails is that papers or assignments are submitted anonymously so that different preceptors grade different assignments by the same student over the course of the semester. A version of this already exists for some courses in the philosophy department, and there is little to suggest that it isn’t feasible to expand it to other departments. This still wouldn’t fix the problem of disparity, as some assignments would be worth more than others, but it would still reduce the scale of the problem. The third and more general issue is a lack of transparency about how preceptors are appointed and judged. Students are required to file reviews at the end of the year, but there seems to be little information about how seriously that is taken. Or, in another case, how certain graduate students are chosen over others to lead precepts. While I agree that this part of the process lies with the administration of the University, students should still be in the loop, especially with their feedback, because it is their time at Princeton that is ultimately affected most by precepts and preceptors. For better or for worse, precepts are here to stay. If we are to truly differentiate ourselves as a superior institution, geared toward undergraduate study, academic change must not be limited to a discussion on the grade deflation policy. There are other things, too, that require a rethink.|~|Ali Akram Hayat is a philosophy major from Lahore, Pakistan. He can be reached at ahayat@princeton.edu. 
68891|~|Don't send your kid to BCG|~|   September 28 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Cameron Langford|~|None|~|Were you to stroll into Whig Hall last Thursday afternoon, you would have found a bevy of Princeton students debating with a former Yale professor. The topic? Whether to send your kid to the Ivy League. William Deresiewicz’s answer, for those who somehow missed his notorious New Republic article this summer, is “don’t.” He expounds upon his argument in “Excellent Sheep,” the book for which he is currently on tour. In it, he paints a bleak picture of the modern elite university. But his argument begins well before students are 18. Students as young as elementary schoolers become wrapped up in a process of admissions gaming that bills itself as a meritocracy but, with its emphasis on costly extracurriculars, looks rather more like classism. Building a Harvard-worthy resume requires both the WASP-y values of sportsmanship and the score-driven excellence of the “modern technocrat,” wrapping students up — whether by their own choice or their parents’ — in what Deresiewicz called “an egalitarian war of all against all.” In Deresiewicz’s narrative, this anxious, utilitarian spirit then follows the students to college. And so it goes: Overloaded high schoolers became overloaded college students, and the whole cycle begins anew. But now, worried not about admission to a university but to the upper-middle class lifestyle of their parents, these students begin to frantically retool their resumes for the next hoop: finance and consulting applications. In many ways, Deresiewicz’s arguments about the success-driven culture of Ivy League job recruiting are on point. Because the application process for many elite jobs resembles that of the college application process, it requires very little effort or imagination for the overwhelmed senior. For those who aren’t interested, there are other advertised options, but they are largely limited to the nonprofit world and, in some cases, the tech world (Blogger Cal Newport calls this our “stunted career vocabulary”, and David Brooks characterizes it as a “blinkered view of [our] options”). In the Ivy League student’s psyche, these two options play the role of Disney princes and villains: one is poor but charming, the other pompous but wealthy. That’s the crux of the modern student’s anxiety, Deresiewicz argues: that there exists no gray area between success and failure, rich and poor, good and bad. That explains why students today are so risk-averse, why they insist on measuring the value of their education not in pages read but in future dollars. And it explains why elite universities have taken these changes in stride, no longer justifying their liberal arts curricula with humanist arguments but instead turning toward financial ones. Colleges, Deresiewicz laments, are no longer in the business of building souls. Full disclosure: Right now, I am in the process of applying for consulting jobs myself. This is partly because, after spending the summer with people who got their public sector start in the private sector, I buy their pitch (work for us now; save the world later) and partly because my options do indeed feel somewhat blinkered (One thing Deresiewicz never acknowledges is that many industries students such as myself might formerly have entered, like academia and journalism, are dying or fossilized; another is that the gap between rich and poor is at almost at cartoonish levels). But though I am anxious about the future, I’m still not ready to indict Princeton and the whole Ivy hamster wheel. Finding a vocational calling — or building a soul, which Deresiewicz wants to conflate — seems a much bigger task than can be answered in four years. This is the point made by Joshua Rothman, the current archive editor at The New Yorker and the other guest at the panel. Like Rothman, who wrote an eloquent response to Deresiewicz, I think that while college can lay the groundwork for answering some of life’s big questions, it can’t hope to actually answer them. Ultimately, questions of purpose are more individual and less institutional than Deresiewicz would have us believe, and unlike the standardized tests that got us here, they aren’t multiple-choice. These are questions that require constant attention, constant reworking and reconsidering. And I doubt those questions will quiet down anytime soon, whether I’m filling out Excel speadsheets for Bain Capital or fetching coffee as an unpaid New Yorker intern or just sleeping in my childhood bedroom. Certainly, Princeton and universities like it could do more to provide awareness of job opportunities beyond the finance and consulting/nonprofit binary (Career Services, to its credit, is trying, with events like the new “alternative” career fair).  And I don’t mean to suggest that all jobs are created equal when it comes to soul-searching. But I’m still not sure Princeton has sold my soul. By encouraging me to ask the kinds of questions posed by Deresiewicz and Rothman, and by surrounding me with peers as interested in figuring things out as myself, it might even have helped me start to build one.|~|Cameron Langford is a politics major from Davidson, N.C.

68872|~|Editorial: Career Services peer fellow program|~|   September 28 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Two weeks ago the University’s Office of Career Services organized the first-ever HireTigers Meetup, a development of the previous career fair recruitment model. This meetup, in addition to a series of Career and Life Vision Workshops, is part of Career Services’ ongoing effort to reevaluate their performance and improve the quality and relevance of their services. The Editorial Board lauds the initiative to develop new ways of providing students with effective professional assistance and encourages the program directors to remain responsive to students’ concerns as they shape the Office’s direction. In the spirit of this collaborative evaluation, the Board would like to bring several issues to attention as well as a possible means of redress. Among the concerns are the sizeable demand for services, especially for practice interviews, and the fact that students’ many industry interests require specialized experience. To improve the current strength of Career Services’ performance regarding these issues, the Board suggests instituting a program of peer fellows, similar to that already in place at the Writing Center. It is understandable that, despite the high quality of assistance that is currently available, it is difficult to accommodate the diverse needs of thousands of undergraduates in a timely manner. Interviewing well is a crucial component of the professional skill set, and Career Services does notcurrently have the capacity to meet the demands for mock interviews. While limited half-hour appointments are available with counselors, interviews take the time and full attention of a staff member, sacrificing time that could otherwise be given to other important elements of a job or internship application, such as reviewing resumes and cover letters. Many fields also require interviews with specific technical knowledge of the field in question. Many of the upperclassmen also have more pressing needs given the immediacy of their job search, which may give the underclassmen  lower priority and limited access to these useful resources. In addition, the issue demands an increase in the availability of specialized and competent advice without a significant increase in operating cost. An effective solution to these issues would be to adopt the peer fellow model now in use at the Writing Center. The Writing Center has peer fellows (both undergraduate and graduate students) that offer 50-minute appointments to review and improve writing brought in by fellow students. These fellows are especially competent, as they must have both done well in their previous writing courses and undergone extensive training sessions. These conferences are in high demand, but the Center has around 90 fellows and is able to schedule thousands of appointments each semester. Writing Center fellows are remunerated generously, but the cost of hiring a fellow is nowhere near that of contracting full time staff. This scenario could translate analogously to the situation faced by Career Services. A group of competent interview fellows could increase the capacity of the office to help students with diverse interests at a reasonable cost. To maintain and ensure the quality of the service, these fellows should be upperclassmen or graduate students that have experience in various professional fields. Students who have been able to spend their time working with companies over the summers and have gained the specific insight into what is needed to succeed in that field would be great resources to the rest of the student body. While Career Services currently has a group of peer advisers, their main function is to serve as an information liaison between the office and residential colleges.  They do not offer mock interviews (or any services), as they are neither paid nor trained to do so. The fellows we are proposing could not only assist with general-fit interviews but also with field-specific mock interviews, indicating the elements of particular importance. The fellows could additionally hold counseling hours during which they would be available to give advice as to what has worked for them in pursuing a career in their particular field. This would be of particular benefit to the underclassmen, who could then directly get the advice of students with recent success in achieving professional goals in their freshman and sophomore years. This system of Career Service peer interview fellows might well be the way to increase the availability of mock interview services, improve sources of field-specific experience and engage more underclassmen, all at a reasonable cost.|~|
68601|~|In defense of tourists|~|   September 28 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In a recent opinion post in The New York Times, Anna Altman continues a recent trend, though certainly not a new phenomenon, of decrying tourists and tourism in general. Rather than seeing travel as a “bucket list … of places to check off,” she writes, we should actively embrace the Grand Tour model of tourism among young, upper-class men in the 17th through 19th centuries, in which we travel abroad (for months on end, if possible), seeking “cross-cultural experiences” and avoiding tourist traps like the Vatican and the Eiffel Tower as though they were the bubonic plague. It should surprise no one who reads them that these pieces are found in (among other publications) The New Yorker. My main problem with the argument here is that even if it is true (which I struggle to believe), it at best only applies to the high-and-mighty, self-righteous trust-fund hipster subset of our population. Even assuming that avoiding tourist destinations is always good, as the authors purport, effectively no one outside of the ivory-tower bubble could possibly afford to consciously emulate the Grand Tour. In their long heyday, Grand Tours were the hottest trend for those 20-somethings who were the scions of Europe and America’s aristocratic families. The Grand Tour was an opportunity for these salt-of-the-earth people, in which the stresses of a multimillionaire upbringing could be left behind for a several-month séjour to western Europe or the American West (often accompanied by a troupe of servants). To suggest that this mode of travel, never historically intended for mass consumption, is the “Right Way to Travel” (as Altman’s piece is titled), is an arrogant and elitist contention that applies to almost no one. But now on to my actual objections to the argument in favor of recreating the Grand Tour. Tourism in the mainstream sense, though it isolates the visitor from the host culture, at least allows one to physically and literally “see the world.” A significant feature of the modern world nonexistent (at least to the same degree) in 1800 is that Western expats don’t just cross the Atlantic. For many people, the only way to discover their favorite place or country on Earth is to sample the wide world of the 21st century. Saving for years or decades to undertake a four-month adventure to one specific and small set of places (the standard London-Paris-Florence jaunt, for instance) could mean that a potential Sinophile would never see China, and more generally, never discover the eye-opening feeling of falling in love with a place and a people. By contrast, taking more trips of shorter distance to a wider diversity of destinations allows one to see what they really enjoy, and perhaps even discover a latent passion for a place, a history or a culture. Second, anyone interested in history can vouch that there is a unique feeling in knowing you stand where Churchill, Lincoln or Galileo once did or seeing the palace from which hundreds of years of Chinese dynastic or French monarchic history unfolded. Physically being there connects one to the events that shaped world history in a way that even the most vivid textual description can’t. As a sophomore flirting with the prospect of becoming a history major, I may have some bias here, but I think everyone has a little history buff inside them yearning to be free. What better way to do so than by seeing all the “touristy” or “Top 10 in [Country Name]” places you can? Third, many times the reason tourist sites are so popular is that they are in fact some of the best or most beautiful. While knowing what happened at Mont Saint-Michel makes it immeasurably cooler, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand why it’s the most visited site in France outside of Paris. The intrinsic beauty, uniqueness or architectural marvel of many buildings, artworks and sites are often justification enough for braving the lines and paying through the nose. If there is a correct modern-day interpretation of the Grand Tour, and I believe there is, it can be found in the “OEs” of present-day New Zealanders. Overseas Experiences, as they’re known, are when New Zealanders leave their homeland for a few months or a few years, pack up and move and often take up long-term work in a new country (most commonly England, Japan, France and the United States). Why is the OE better than the Grand Tour? Because it allows for actual cultural immersion and appreciation, and is accessible to the masses. An OE usually involves full-time work in the new country, and there is simply no better way to understand a culture than by adopting a daily routine there and truly putting down roots. Even for that large majority of us for whom a job is necessary for financial stability at home, the OE still provides an opportunity to travel for an extended period of time because the traveler takes up work in the host country. Unlike a Grand Tour, in which the traveler brings a staff of servants, art-buyers and translators, stays in the finest hotels in the Western world and often isolates himself with other people of similar upbringings, the OE forces one to become self-sufficient in a foreign culture, and extensive interaction and cultural assimilation are easily facilitated. So if you’re ever in a position to decide, for the love of God, go see Michelangelo’s “David.” Even the busloads of people taking selfies won’t diminish the inevitable feeling of awe you won’t get by Googling it.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

68734|~|Philanthropy in China|~|   September 25 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|In 2007, Princeton alumnus Sir Gordon Wu ’58, the namesake of Wu Hall in Butler College, completed payments of $100 million that he pledged to the university in 1995, bringing his total lifetime donations to over $118 million. He gave this donation to support the School of Engineering and Applied Science, particularly to increase the number of endowed professorships, supporting renovations and construction, and to provide fellowships to graduate students. As the giver of one of the single largest donations in the University’s history, Wu was a pioneer in many ways. Earlier this year, Bill Gates, also an avid philanthropist, urged wealthy Chinese people to engage in and encourage more philanthropy, implying that philanthropy is not as common a practice in China as it is in the United States. The numbers certainly support that assumption — in 2013, China’s top 100 philanthropists gave away $890 million, which is, according to Forbes, less than what Mark Zuckerberg and his wife gave away in one year. This is despite the fact that according to Shanghai research firm Hurun, China surpassed the United States as the country with the highest number of billionaires. Looking at the wealth divide between the richest in the country and the vast number of the poor with many issues to address, it’s surprising that charity hasn’t gotten more attention in China. China’s substantial number of donations in times of crisis seems to support the notion that lack of philanthropy is not a result of lack of empathy. China’s total donations to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake amounted to over 100 billion RMB, nearly five times the total amount given to charities the previous year. However, consistent patterns of giving are still in the process of being established. Chinese philanthropy hasn’t always been underachieving. In Imperial China, public facilities like bridges and schools were often built with the contributions of generous nobles. Village clinics and soup kitchens were similarly supported by wealthy donors. By the time of the arrival of communism, personal wealth was marginalized and became part of the state’s property. Philanthropy was no longer deemed necessary, since any additional need for funds was a criticism and a sign of the failure of the government, not as a charitable act.  Additional obstacles to giving include not only a lack of recent tradition but also a lack of transparency in Chinese charities. Only 30 percent of registered charities in China meet basic international standards for transparency, according to China Charity Transparency Report. Due to the many scandals attributed to Chinese charities and their lax accounting practices, Chinese people have begun to view charities as scams. Total donations in China dropped in 2011 and 2012 from previous years because of a scandal involving the Red Cross Society of China, a government organization that is the country’s largest charity.  A 20 year-old woman, Guo MeiMei, posted several photos online of her lavish lifestyle, posing with luxury cars and designer handbags that she claimed she owned. Her verified title on her blog was “commercial general manager” at the Red Cross. While the Red Cross later said she had no relation to them, donations still suffered. Later in the year, a photo of a $1,500 restaurant bill for a group of Red Cross workers surfaced, causing more outrage. After that, the National Audit Office issued a report on the Red Cross pointing out five financial errors, namely money spent that was unaccounted for. As the largest charity in China, and as the charity most prominently backed by the state government, it was no wonder that losing faith in the Red Cross meant losing faith in giving altogether. One prominent philanthropist, Chen Guangbiao, hasn’t been helping in changing people’s perceptions of charity, either using methods such as “stacking piles of cash to form a wall for a photo op or dancing on the rooftops of brand new cars that he bought for donation.” Using attention-grabbing techniques to encourage the rich in China to give more to charity, Guangbiao has alienated the majority of people and turned giving into a circus. His intentions, however noble, haven’t helped toward the result he wanted. He instead has reinforced the idea of charity as wasteful, extravagant, and not meaningful. Ronnie Chan, a Hong Kong property businessman, like Wu, donated $350 million to Harvard in September. Some criticized him for giving to an already wealthy university rather than one in China. When Wu was asked the same questions, he responded that it was important to maintain Princeton’s top quality, rather than spend it in Asia to “produce more mediocrity.” Chan responded that he liked to “donate to projects that we think are meaningful.” Looking at the state of Chinese charity organizations, it seems reasonable for Chinese philanthropists to choose causes away from China. Chinese philanthropy, unfortunately, is stunted because of the lack of trustworthy organizations to donate the money to and the lack of encouragement from others. It’s not a commentary on the generosity of donors themselves, but on the worry that they don’t know where the money goes, and rightly so.|~|
68741|~|In response to "Called out by name"|~|   September 25 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|To the Editor, I write in response to Shruthi Deivasigamani’s Sept. 24 column “Called out by name,” in which she argues against the publication of the names of students who are arrested on campus for what she calls “passive” crimes. Ms. Deivasigamani’s view is both misinformed and incorrect. The role of a campus newspaper is to report the facts. The facts, in this case, were that a student was arrested on campus after a Department of Public Safety officer reportedly found the student in possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia. Among the drugs reported to have been in the student’s possession was psilocybin, a controlled substance under state and federal law, the possession of which — as the column points out — is an indictable offense under New Jersey law (equivalent to what’s called a felony in other states). Once the editors of the ‘Prince’ determined that this story was newsworthy, there is simply no reason that the ‘Prince’ would be compelled to withhold the student’s name; indeed, publication of the names of persons arrested for crimes (other than minors) is the practice of every major newspaper in the country, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post. As Ms. Deivasigamani notes, the fact of the student’s arrest is a matter of public record, reported on the Public Safety website and on the crime blotter of local newspapers like The Princeton Packet. The details of such arrests (including arrestees’ names) are routinely reported in the press because the public casino online  has an interest both (i) in knowing what crimes are reported to have been committed in the community and who is accused of having committed those crimes, and (ii) in the transparency of the public’s interactions with law enforcement. Contrary to what Ms. Deivasigamani suggests, it does not serve that interest to wait months or even years for a criminal conviction to result before publishing the name of someone arrested for a criminal offense. There are many reasons a criminal conviction may not ultimately result from an arrest — for instance, because a prosecutor exercises his discretion not to pursue a case, because he reaches a plea deal with a criminal defendant or because there is simply not enough evidence to meet the demanding “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard. However, that does not mean the fact of the arrest and the events leading up to it are not newsworthy. Nevertheless, Ms. Deivasigamani believes that the ‘Prince’ should self-censor and excise the names of students from its news stories — at least, those students arrested for “passive” crimes, whatever that means. Her only apparent reason for advocating this position is that Princeton is “filled with ambitious students who undoubtedly want to do important things with their lives.” However, Ms. Deivasigamani’s concern for the employment and career prospects of her classmates surely does not outweigh the public’s right to be informed. That concern, if anything, is certainly is not “the role of [a] newspaper.” Carlos M. Lazatin ’99|~|

68717|~|Editorial: Formalize and Crowd-Source Course Requests|~|   September 25 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Over the past few weeks, a petition has circulated asking that the University reinstate course offerings in Sanskrit. The petition identifies a present dearth in alternative language programming, noting the far broader range of options available at our peer institutions, and demanding that Princeton expand its own course offerings. That a petition is required to draw the University’s attention to a lack of programming underscores a broader issue, namely, the present lack of a formal process to propose new and permanent courses at the University. Currently, students who wish to study a topic beyond the purview of the University’s present course offerings may pursue one of two options — reading courses or student-initiated seminars. While these programs gesture in the right direction, their specific processes of proposal and their lack of full recognition prevent them from fully addressing student needs. A reading course, as described by the Office of the Dean of the College, is “a specially designed course not normally offered as part of the curriculum that is arranged between a student and a faculty member.” These courses allow students to independently pursue a subject of interest under the guidance of a faculty member. Unfortunately, a number of problems exist with their current implementation. First, awareness of these programs is sparse, and the University does little to promote these initiatives among student or faculty. Even if a course is proposed and approved, however, it does not enjoy the same benefits as does a regular departmental offering. Reading courses cannot be used to satisfy a distribution requirement, nor are they designated on the transcript with standard course levels, even if their content and workload is similar to a normal course offering in the department. Instead, they receive a special 090 course level, both downplaying their rigor and failing to provide an accurate indication of their depth and content. Student-initiated seminars are similar to reading courses; they too, are intended to allow the study of a subject not presently offered at the University, albeit in a larger group context than offered by reading courses. Unfortunately, they similarly suffer a number of pitfalls, as they cannot fulfill distribution requirements and also require that the student initiator provide the University with at least 12 names of students who agree to enroll. This places the onus for finding interested students on the proposer, which discourages new course proposals and provides no mechanism for publicizing the possibility of a new course. Further, by their very nature, both student-initiated seminars and reading courses are treated by the University as exclusively one-off cases, and do not presently have a mechanism to become permanent additions to a department’s offerings, even if they are successful. This Board recommends that the University implement a formal web-based platform for student course proposals. In so doing, it can look to the format of the enormously successful varieties of crowd-funding websites. Such a website would allow students to propose new courses, then allow their peers to indicate an interest in taking a course if offered. This alleviates the burden of individually finding 12 people who agree to enroll and allows the University to gauge student interest and respond accordingly. Ultimately, this type of formal and crowd-sourced proposal system would ensure that the University’s courses enable students to engage in serious intellectual inquiry in all academic fields.|~|

68558|~|Response to the Tory Letter from the Publisher|~|   September 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|When I opened the September issue of The Princeton Tory at breakfast this past week, I was met with the bold-print title “Plan Your Time At Princeton,” under which was placed a photograph of a man reading a very, very, very old book. Intrigued, and hoping to discover the name of whatever first-edition manuscript had informed this crash-course guide for freshmen, I read on. I soon found, however, that I was actually reading a “Letter From the Publisher” written by Zach Horton ’15 (who is also a member of this newspaper’s editorial board). Dishearteningly, I also found that whatever knowledge the timeworn book had to impart certainly had not made its way into this letter. At first, I was taken aback by the writer’s ostentatious vocabulary. If he was trying to make a guide for the newest members of our student body, as he claimed, why did I come across more highbrow terms than in the 19th-century scholarly essays I’ve parsed through for class? I imagined worried freshmen consulting Dictionary.com in secret and terrified that phrases like “platitudinal suffocations” and “obfuscate rather than illuminate” were colloquialisms on campus, although it is probably more realistic to imagine the writer right-clicking furiously for synonyms and the freshmen more than able to manage it. In fact, even if the intended audience had actually needed to reference a dictionary, they would have still had trouble with “platitudinal” and would have had to settle instead on the definition for the actual adjective form “platitudinous.” I understood the writer’s need to create the air of wisdom so he could impart some on downwards, but such stiff language left me with the impression that any advice given throughout the letter was as posed as the full bookcase in front of which the writer stood in his photograph. Still, I plunged onward. The language was a bit pretentious, but, I thought, perhaps the meaning of them had merit.   There were a few neat kernels of sound advice (such as to research the reputation of a potential professor and to focus primarily on one’s education at Princeton), but on the whole they were hidden among vague platitudes (to use that prodigious word one last time) and contradictions. For example, our writer warns freshmen “not to be led astray by the ‘expand your horizons’ mentality,” only to go on to say, “of course [freshmen] should endeavor to learn things presently unfamiliar to [them], step outside of [their] so-called ’comfort-zone’.” This, though, is all that is meant when people set out to expand their horizons. We never learn what other, more insidious, connotation the term “expand your horizons” has beyond this definition. The only other advice the writer offers on the matter is that one should pick classes worth taking instead of those with “alluring course title[s] and florid description[s];” good advice, yes, but wholly unrelated to all expanding horizon mantras. The writer’s paranoia continues in his next paragraph, where he cautions against tolerance and open-mindedness. Benevolent as such terms may seem, the writer is sure “both are dangerous snippets of partial wisdom.” The next sentence gives no clues about what dangers such seemingly innocent traits are hiding; instead of describing what terrible things may befall those of us who are tolerant and open-minded, he reverses his argument, saying, “be tolerant, naturally, of all people.” So then perhaps we were never meant to suspect those charming traits after all, and what the writer actually meant was that we should be tolerant of all people, just not of all people’s ideas. I think this is an intelligent way to approach the world, and if the writer had stopped his commentary on tolerance here, I would have agreed with him. Yet in the next sentence, the writer goes on to say that incoming freshmen should not ever “tolerate false ideas … even if cloaked in the language of ‘personal identity’.” With this new addendum, the writer’s definition of tolerance now dangerously conflates ideas with personal identities, a fusion that quickly undermines the writer’s previous desire for tolerance of all people. With this confused definition of tolerance, the writer moves on to tackle open-mindedness. The mind, he says, must close onto something; he suggests this something should be “truth.” Here, I think the writer has again, at first glance, chosen something reasonable. This rationality is muddied by the dissonance of the rest of the letter, though, and I am confident that the writer uses the vague value of “truth” the same way he does “virtue,” “character,” and “tolerance” — as placeholders for his own system of beliefs. The writer’s omniscient expectation of freshmen to “clamp down hard” once they find the truth is ludicrous; I will still not have found an ultimate truth on which to clamp down on until after I’ve graduated, after I’ve retired, perhaps never, and it would be irresponsible and self-righteous of me to settle upon a single truth now and never let anything else in. It is this immutable and definitive language that the writer uses when referring to truth that makes it his truth, and not the truth. And so it is here, instead of in reference to tolerance and open-mindedness, that I say, “freshmen, beware.”|~|Mitchell Hammer is a sophomore from Phoenix, Ariz.

68575|~|A chance to lead on addressing sexual misconduct|~|   September 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|The University is finally taking steps to address a policy that should have been discussed and updated years ago: its policy and procedures on sexual misconduct, an umbrella term encompassing sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape. Like many others, I welcome this new standard and proposed update to Princeton’s Rights, Rules, Responsibilities as a significant improvement in policy, even if it is imperfect and insufficient, as last week’s editorial outlined. This past Sunday, the Undergraduate Student Government held a town hall to shed light on the many changes that are likely to be implemented. Most are actually mandated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a fact that most students didn’t initially realize. The OCR released a report and new guidelines on sexual misconduct on campuses this summer outlining what Princeton and the other 70+ universities under federal investigation must do to be in compliance with Title IX. The federally mandated changes include: lowering the standard of evidence from “clear and persuasive” (highly probable) to a “preponderance” (more likely than not) level, no students on the adjudicatory panel, parity of appeal rights for the complainant and respondent, trained investigators as fact finders and adjudicators, and outside advisors allowed during all meetings. Some of the concerns raised about aspects of the new policy at the town hall meeting, including the lower burden of proof, would have to be taken up federally and not by the University committee. (Personally, while I applaud the federal government’s actions, in both the executive and legislative branches, for trying to tackle the country’s ubiquitous college sexual assault problem, I do acknowledge that not all of the new standards are ideal. But neither has been the status quo. Ultimately, our criminal justice system, as well as college procedures regarding sexual assault, must also be overhauled.) But Princeton’s issues surrounding sexual assault will not disappear with the adoption of these new standards. Among other issues, there remains the issue of the University’s perceived reluctance to acknowledge that a real problem has existed and its reserved attitude towards these much-needed changes. Once this new policy is in place, the University should seize this opportunity to become a leader. The University must continue to seek out and adopt the best policies for its students, to increase discussion and understanding of the issues at hand, and to create a more transparent reporting and adjudication process. The University may seem like it is embracing these changes with open arms given how quickly everything is now being passed. After all, the OCR only released its recommendations in July. But the Title IX case against Princeton was filed almost four years ago, in 2010. In April 2011, the Department of Education mandated the “preponderance of evidence” standard. However, Princeton administrators believed that any student disciplinary proceeding was not subject to the Title IX requirement but rather could be held to a “clear and persuasive” standard. At the time, Princeton made very little effort to overhaul its policies, save for a redefinition of terms. Meanwhile, other universities began changing their policies. At Dartmouth, for example, the administration undertook a major overhaul, appointing independent investigators. Princeton administrators could see that policy changes at other schools hadn’t “raised many red flags” or created major problems, according to The Daily Princetonian. However, the article explained, Princeton is still “the last institution in the Ivy League to adopt these changes.” Princeton did little, as a recent Washington Post op ed by a current Princeton graduate student highlights. It is only under the threat of the “nuclear option,” as it was called at the town hall, of losing all federal funding, that policy changes are finally being implemented. The University must continue to look for further ways to improve its policy and procedures within the guidelines and possibly in some cases by going beyond the federally mandated requirements. This can include, but certainly isn’t limited to, appointing or subsidizing counsel to maintain parity despite socioeconomic background, defining and clarifying more terms including “consent” and “incapacitation” and hiring fully independent investigators, not ones governed by the Dean of Undergraduate Students staff or something similar. While University officials may truly want to assist student victims of sexual misconduct, they also, understandably but unfortunately, have a vested interest in maintaining the University’s image and reputation. There continues to be an incentive for Princeton, and every university for that matter, to underreport situations of sexual misconduct. In addition, the University can and must do more to improve how students view sexual interactions. The town hall demonstrated a great divide between male and female students on the issue and wide misconceptions about the old and new standards. More discussions need to occur on campus to narrow the different perceptions between some males and females so that we can do a better job of preventing sexual misconduct before it occurs. Rush Limbaugh’s take, one heard many times before, on these new college policies was to ask rhetorically, “How many guys, in your own experience with women, have seen that ‘no’ means ‘yes’ if you know how to spot it?” A debate on policy changes and social mores needs to continue both on campus and nationally. The University must implement more educational programs on the issue and show that it is willing to be a leader among peer institutions in this area and not the slow adopter it has been so far. The first action the University can take, and something the deans at the town hall alluded that they were hoping to do, is to increase transparency regarding the policies, new and old. Sunday’s town hall was a great start, and the planned faculty-student Committee on Sexual Misconduct is potentially another. For example, some students seemed surprised to find out that the records of individuals “convicted” of sexual misconduct are never released, unless subpoenaed in a court. And given that sometimes, as another student highlighted, students don’t come forward because they don’t want someone to be permanently punished, clarifying this reality could help bring justice to issues of sexual misconduct across campus. Knowing all the ins and outs and the definitions (especially since they often differ from criminal definitions) is essential to making these policy changes effective and the best they can be until further policy and cultural changes are made both at the University and nationally.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

68412|~|Princeton should provide broader financial aid|~|   September 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|“Princeton IS affordable.” “For more than three decades, we’ve considered students for admission to Princeton without concern over their families’ ability to pay — and offered aid to cover 100 percent of each admitted student’s need.” “We … meet 100 percent of each admitted student’s financial need with generous aid packages.” These are just a few examples of how the University brags about its financial aid packages on its financial aid website. Princeton’s peer institutions all spew the same rhetoric. And while the statistics suggest it is true that Princeton covers 100 percent of the costs it deems as “needed,” this does not match what all families consider as their need. For many families, the University’s definition of demonstrated need differs from their perceived actual need, causing students to be forced to give up Princeton as an option. These families in the middle might beg to differ regarding Princeton’s affordability. Many students must have a serious family discussion about finances and determine which school to attend based on the varying aid packages universities offer. Some decide to struggle and make it work at a school with a less generous package, but every year, I see students from my high school turn down schools like Princeton to go to our state university on a full ride or other substantial scholarship. And I highly doubt this is an isolated case. The recent U.S. News & World Report rankings said that of their top-ranking 25 universities, Princeton is 22 in economic diversity. While the criteria of these rankings aren’t always ideal, it does suggest a troubling reality. Further, there are current Princeton students from families in the middle who are facing financial hardship while here. Of course, while the system isn’t perfect, financial aid has come a long way. With a no loan policy, early action that allows students to apply to these schools without worrying that they will be committed to a school they cannot afford to attend and study abroad covered, Princeton’s aid package certainly is a godsend to many students. In fact, according to Princeton’s own statistics, approximately 60 percent of Princeton students get some amount of aid, and the average annual package is around $41,450. The problem is, they can do more, much more. Not all schools can afford to cover more student expenses, In fact, most don’t have large enough per student endowments. But Princeton can afford to provide greater aid to families in the middle, and should. A study by The Washington Monthly suggests that Princeton, along with Harvard, Yale, Stanford and possibly others, can essentially afford to grant free tuition. Currently, Harvard appears to be doing a better job of providing financial aid than Princeton is, although according to this math, both could do more. All schools that can do more, should. I am not suggesting that schools with such substantial endowments should be completely free for everyone, as there are other beneficial uses for each university’s money. However, these private, nonprofit universities should no longer just be for the privileged elite who can pay or students from lower-income families. Having a truly socioeconomically diverse intellectual community, which includes students from this middle group, improves the learning environment, as students can learn from each other’s experiences. The best way to guarantee that price is not a prohibitive factor when students are selecting colleges is for more financial aid to be available to the whole range of the country’s middle class. Individuals should have a right to higher education, and if avoidable, finances should not affect the decision of which universities students choose to attend. It is only fair that anyone who gets into an elite school with a substantial endowment actually has the freedom to make a decision.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Washington, D.C.

68409|~|Called out by name |~|   September 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|On Sept. 10, The Daily Princetonian published a news article, “Student charged with drug possession at Princeton Stadium,” about an undergraduate student who was arrested by the University’s Department of Public Safety for allegedly being in possession of marijuana and psilocybin, a compound found in psychedelic mushrooms, at the Princeton Stadium. The article clearly stated both the student’s full name and class year and reignited an age-old debate about whether the ‘Prince’ should publish the names of students in articles regarding their arrests, particularly when they have only been charged, and the case has not yet been adjudicated. One thing that should be noted: The ‘Prince’ technically has the right to publish the student’s name. The name is public record and is available to anyone actively seeking out the information. That being said, just because a news outlet can do something, doesn’t mean it should. Arrests can be a matter of campus safety — if something happens that directly concerns the well-being of other students, it would be wise to make sure everyone is informed. The most important feature of the particular crime at hand was how passive it was. The student arrested was allegedly under the influence of marijuana and allegedly was carrying marijuana, psilocybin and drug paraphernalia. There is no mention in the article that he was hurting anyone, nor that he was causing any sort of disturbance. He wasn’t a danger to others. The ‘Prince,’ therefore, had no good reason to publish his name other than because it was juicy gossip. But that’s not the role of the newspaper. It isn’t supposed to be a seedy tabloid, pointing fingers and airing dirty laundry. It’s even harder to justify the actions undertaken by the ‘Prince’ when we consider how selectively the supposed policy — that of reporting the names of students arrested — is applied. The Princeton Police Department, a separate police force from Public Safety, arrests students for underage possession of liquor and use of fake IDs frequently as well. This, too, is information made public, easily accessible on The Princeton Packet’s regular reporting of the police blotter. The fact that underage drinking is more common on campus doesn’t make it any less illegal than possession of marijuana, but the ‘Prince’ doesn’t call these individuals out for breaking the law. If there were actually a consistently implemented policy of naming every student who is arrested, there would be an article every two weeks about the latest sophomore busted leaving the liquor store with a handle of vodka. Princeton is a school, like most, filled with ambitious students who undoubtedly want to do important things with their lives. The thing is, the arrest wasn’t just reported on unnecessarily; it was reported on prematurely. The case could easily be thrown out for any number of reasons between arrest and conviction. Furthermore, even if it is legitimate, if the student is a first-time offender, it’s likely that he will be eligible to have his record expunged after six months. At that point, the only evidence that will remain on the Internet is a college newspaper article written the night that the arrest happened. Potential hires don’t need to disclose the contents of criminal records that have been expunged, but a rudimentary Google search would probably bring this article up. By publishing an article with a name, the ‘Prince’ is overriding something that the law deemed irrelevant. There is no added benefit of including the name of a student arrested for a passive crime. It highlights a sporadically applied policy and reduces the campus newspaper into a gossip column. In the future, more consideration should be given to the function of the ‘Prince.’ We aren’t Big Brother. We aren’t Perez Hilton. It isn’t the paper’s responsibility or duty to shame a student for something that affects no one but himself.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a molecular biology major from Cresskill, N.J.

68381|~|On Hillflint |~|   September 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|This past week, all members of the Class of 2017 received an email from the class council telling us about this year’s class gear. The chosen product? Traditional-looking sweaters from Hillflint, a company that started selling sweaters in 2012 and was founded by two students from Dartmouth and Princeton. To be very blunt, the product is expensive, traditional sweaters from Hillflint. The decision to sell these sweaters as class gear is classist and exclusionary. The class council has two price options: $75 or $55, depending on the material you select. Our school has a student population where 60 percent of students are on financial aid. These prices are bound to be unaffordable for some students. The purpose of class gear is to build spirit and unity among members of the class. What does it say when some students are completely shut out of this experience with no way to get in? In its email, the council presents the idea of the sweaters as part of a tradition that stretches back to the early 20th century, a tradition that we can now bring back. I would argue that we should actually be striving to reject the traditions represented by such a sweater. These traditions are a part of an earlier Princeton, one run only for and by men from wealthy families. Of course, it is impossible for one sweater to completely undermine years of progress in the direction of equality, but it does promote a lingering sense of elitism that we should instead be trying to combat. A common perception of the University is that it is unwelcoming to people from underprivileged backgrounds. Offering an expensive sweater as a token of belonging in the class does nothing to dispel that notion. It is not the norm for class gear to be so expensive. For example, last year’s Class of 2017 class gear was a sweatshirt that cost only $20. This represents a larger spirit of inclusivity on the part of the University, as the lower price is less of an insurmountable boundary for students from lower-income backgrounds. Even in last year’s scenario though, the most inclusive path would be to subsidize for students on financial aid. However, this year’s ratcheting up of the price makes the need for action more immediate. With the price hike, the sweater has become more inaccessible. That is, more students are now excluded from class spirit. Something needs to be done about this. There are so many different paths the class council could have taken in order to be more inclusive. First of all, there could have been a reduced cost for students on financial aid. This is a tactic used to ensure that people can join in on other Princeton bonding experiences, such as Outdoor Action. Even the expensive eating clubs are subsidized for students on financial aid. Of course this would come at a financial cost to the University, or perhaps even to the council’s budget, but if the sweaters are important as a Princeton tradition, then it would be worth it. It would, in any case, be better than shutting out people whose families have lower incomes. Another option would be to create a partnership with Hillflint similar to how the University Store has a partnership with brands like Brooks Brothers and Ralph Lauren. Or, independently of that, the council could design and offer affordable class gear, as it has in years past. This would allow people who have the means and desire to purchase the sweater, without excluding others. My intention is not to criticize students who have ordered the sweater or to decry the existence of luxury goods in general. It is a fact in this world that if you have a higher income, you can afford to buy more expensive things. However, that does not make it acceptable for luxury goods to be promoted at Princeton as a symbol of belonging to the class. The end result is making people with lower incomes feel unwelcome at their own school. It is extremely privileged to assume that everyone can afford such an item and, in the context of spirit wear, that is very important. It is imperative to create an atmosphere of equality and inclusion here at Princeton. These sweaters are representative of the fact that, unfortunately, this is not always the case.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va. She can be reached at zmubarak@princeton.edu. Correction: Due to a reporting error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Hillflint was a company that was in operation at the start of the 20th century. The company was started in 2012 by two college students.

68218|~|On early concentration|~|   September 22 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|For sophomores, it’s a decision year, and among all of those decisions, one of the most important is what concentration to choose. It’s a big question that determines much of our time at Princeton. For some, like myself, the largely ignored option of early concentration was a great opportunity I was lucky to find out about from a fantastic senior. Let me fill you in. Early concentration is the opportunity for sophomores to declare their major during first semester and begin independent research early. For a history major like me, that meant writing my first junior paper during the second semester of sophomore year. Early concentration is available in all of the following departments: history, East Asian studies, comparative literature, philosophy, physics, French and Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, psychology, ecology and evolutionary biology, astrophysical sciences, German, chemistry, classics and sociology. The process of early concentration varies with each department, but for me, it required a meeting with the departmental representative and a short interview about my desire to study history. I also met with the professor who would be advising my junior paper research and teaching the 400-level history course required of all concentrators. Early concentration has certain advantages. Diving earlier into a department is certainly rewarding and can provide more access to funding, professors and department-specific opportunities. Learning the discipline of department-specific research early only enhances the other courses in one’s concentration: I became more appreciative in my other history classes to find readings easily available on Blackboard after going through the process of tracking down physical documents in different libraries. As there were only three of us completing junior papers in my history seminar, we had the undivided attention of our professor. Early concentration allows more freedom to study abroad, and by completing research early, I do not have to write a junior paper while abroad. It also allows more flexibility to pursue certificates. Professors are enthusiastic about early concentrators. Most I’ve talked to, from history to German, love to meet with students who love their subject and look forward to encouraging students to develop their research discipline earlier in their Princeton careers. Neta Bahcall of the astrophysical sciences department said, “The benefits, with any field, is those who decide to early concentrate are students that are really interested and know what they want to do, be it astrophysics or anything. That’s where the fun is — getting yourself immersed in the topic.” Students are, of course, excited about early concentration — those who choose to dive into a subject early must be crazy (about the subject). But for those who have not heard of it, I enthusiastically endorse looking at this option. However, early concentration is not for everyone. Professors and department chairs will discourage students from early concentration if they feel the student is not passionate about the subject enough to begin early research. Professor Michael Graziano of the psychology department “does not encourage or discourage” early concentration in general because specialization depends on every student. Early concentration is still not popular, with only a few students declaring early each year. Some declare early and then decide to wait until junior year to begin research. Some departments, such as geosciences and mathematics, allow early research, but not early concentration. Although the Economics department does not have the program, it allows students to take graduate level courses or access funding for summer projects. In my experience, early concentration is an example of one of the reasons I chose Princeton: the chance to work with stellar professors and the support of an academic community while answering a research question, along with the independence (and outcome) of pursuing a topic alone. For sophomores who have fallen in love with a subject, I urge you to consider early concentration by reaching out to the departmental representatives of the disciplines listed above. For freshmen who are still searching, know that this option exists (and if you’re a history nerd like me — see you in the library!).|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

68205|~|The momentum of change|~|   September 22 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|When people ask me about my time in Spain this past summer, it’s interesting to me which details emerge in sharp relief upon retelling. There are the small things, like which bus line I took from my host family’s apartment to get into the main casco, the taste of pig ear and its unsettling texture, the freak torrential downpour that struck as I once again found myself lost in the maze of Toledo’s streets. These things alone shaped my time in Spain, but they also fit into a set of larger experiences that have the potential to change my ideas. One experience in particular always comes to mind when discussing my summer; namely, the abdication of the king and the subsequent round of demonstrations and discussions centered on this historic event. My group from Princeton received the news just before it was set to spend the weekend in Madrid, and I did not personally recognize the significance of an embattled and unpopular leader passing on his power to his son. I didn’t see the political and historical context for what would follow until my host mother and father discussed it in depth at the dinner table. Juan Carlos I was the monarch put into power by General Franco at the end of his dictatorship decades ago; Juan Carlos has since ruled in times of economic crisis that have left many from older generations longing for the sense of stability that they previously had and many younger people clamoring for a true republic. The latter saw their moment in the chaos of the transition and began to call for a referendum on whether or not to keep the monarchy intact. They took to the streets of all the major cities, and I was lucky enough to see one such demonstration in the heart of the largest plaza in Madrid. People flooded into the space, holding tricolor flags of the Second Spanish Republic and signs decrying the royal family. Having heard of violence erupting in the streets of Barcelona in previous days, I was not expecting the relative calm of the scene before me. While people talked in a way that almost charged the air, they did so casually seated by fountains and lounging against lampposts. A 20-something woman handed a sign that, translated, read “King, No!” to a toddler. A newscaster mingled with the crowd. There was no alarm, just pure energy aimed at enacting change. In a country with similarly poor levels of voter turnout, this stuck with me for reasons that surpassed the immediate impressions I had. I’ve seen analogous flickers of hope and energy in America in reaction to various causes or campaigns, and I’ve started to wonder if, somehow, such fervor can be maintained beyond these isolated moments. The other day, I heard someone on campus say that, in general, Princetonians are tired both of being passionate about so many issues and, at the same time, somewhat incapable of affecting many of them.  I certainly don’t ascribe to the view that change cannot be made, but I can understand the sentiment behind this observation and think that there are truths within it that make the answer to my previous question — whether passion and energy can be maintained over long periods of time — no. This may just be symptomatic of an underlying pessimism on my part, but it’s natural for interest to wane over time, and I think the key to enacting change is to find that one matter that can recapture one’s imagination, even when fatigue sets in. For many of the Spaniards, the move to a republic was not like this matter; as politicians continuously thwarted efforts for a referendum, the demonstrations began to die down. I think that, as a community, Princeton can learn from this and recognize that it is capable of creating tangible changes, but that these changes are not inevitable given a certain threshold in terms of numbers or initial commitment. By internalizing this, in turn, perhaps we can sustain the momentum of our own movements for years.|~|Kelly Hatfield is a sophomore from Medford, Mass. She can be reached at kellych@princeton.edu. 
68173|~|A call for housing variety |~|   September 22 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|A pretty standard question that I am asked on Orange Key tours, especially by parents of prospective students, is what the living situation will be like for students at the University. Although they’re inevitably impressed when we walk by Witherspoon and Blair Halls, I find it tough to answer when they ask why there simply aren’t many apartment-style housing options for students, especially compared to other schools. At many schools, there are two such options: off-campus apartments or on-campus, apartment-style dorms. According to the University website, fewer than two percent of students live off-campus. The draw of the residential college system, the ease of being on campus or perhaps the sky-high real estate prices in town lead the vast majority of students to stay inside the Orange Bubble. However, on-campus housing options include only a paucity of apartment-style dorms, especially for undergraduates. Spelman Halls provide such an option, but they contain only 58 apartments and are difficult to obtain for students who are not independent. By providing more flexible dining options for upperclassmen and increasing the number of apartment-style dorms, the University could better meet the housing desires of its student body and prospective students. Our busy course and extracurricular activity schedules often mean that many students find it difficult to plan, purchase and cook food for themselves and their roommates seven days a week. As in many other facets of life, college in this regard is a transition between childhood and the “real world:” independence, but with some degree of a safety net still in place. Allowing students to purchase a smaller meal plan, something on the order of four or six meals a week, for instance, would in turn give more students the confidence to choose to go independent for the remaining meals. Other schools offer upperclassmen this option, such as New York University, because it allows students a flexibility lacking in allowing them to go totally independent. These students, however, would still be faced with housing constraints. Spelman can house a little over 200 students, but more apartments would be needed. While some of Princeton’s peer schools, most notably Yale, don’t have any apartments for undergraduates (because of the four-year residential college system), many other schools to which Princeton applicants apply highlight the flexibility of their housing system as a positive draw. For example, NYU touts the wide availability of apartment-style dorms on its website, and over half of undergraduate residence halls features at least some apartment-style rooms. Additionally and regardless of their housing situation, students have the option of purchasing a wider array of meal plans than offered at Princeton, so students in these apartments can still stop in the dining halls whenever they choose. Princeton should include such apartment-style dorms in all new dorm buildings and pilot retrofitting a few dorms to include apartment facilities. Any increase in housing and dining flexibility can only be a good thing, both for current students and in attracting future ones as well. Finally, it is worthy to remember the question of cost. For many students, the best draw of going independent is that the average cost per meal is significantly lower than for the dining hall plan. Affording this cost-saving option to more Princeton students who could greatly benefit from it is something that the University should be proud to do. The cost to the school of building or retrofitting dorms, though significant, can be easily borne by alumni donations and the endowment. While the endowment itself can’t be used at will for projects like these necessarily, its impressive size does reflect the generosity of alumni and other benefactors. Insofar as I believe people will see this as a project worth funding, I think the endowment represents the willingness of the Princeton community to invest in projects like this to benefit the school. The bottom-line truth in the cost of such a project is that it would not be passed on to students in the form of tuition hikes. A school that has a good educational and residential model is right to replicate that model for every student and make high quality uniform. Having said that, the model itself can be improved by offering greater residential choice to students, and allowing more of them to save money and gain greater independence if they so choose.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

68007|~|All books are equal, but some are more equal than others |~|   September 21 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In economics, a textbook would be called a highly inelastic good — each new generation of students inevitably needs it and, generally, each student will acquire it (often regardless of cost). Though the University’s libraries have sets of these high-in-demand goods, they often sit on the shelves, unused, instead of being utilized by the students who need them the most. With each new semester comes a new list of textbooks to purchase for classes. Course books hardly come cheap, and some can cost upwards of hundreds of dollars, even for a used copy. Some professors will admit that the textbook they list on the syllabus is merely a “recommended” tool to be used for personal reference, but for other classes, the book is a required element that ties in indelibly with the material being taught, which raises a difficult dilemma: Drop big bucks and get the books, or save money and try to get through classes without them. For some students, the problem has a seemingly simple solution — borrow the book from one of the many libraries on campus. After all, the libraries hold several copies of the books required for many courses on its shelves. Most of the libraries’ books can be borrowed for spans of weeks (or even months, if a student renews it), but course books are highly restricted and can only be borrowed on three-hour reserve. There is very little that can be done in three hours. Maybe a student could finish half a problem set (a very industrious, efficient student might even be able to get a bit further). Or a student could read a chapter or two. But his or her work will inevitably have to reach an end — the student could, upon returning the book, attempt to immediately check it out again for continued use, but the process is disruptive at best. Moreover, for (most) students who study over long periods of time (stretching days, weeks and months), the three-hour policy hinders the ability to study at their leisure. The cap is ostensibly well-intentioned — it gives students a chance to glance through a course’s textbooks (most likely during the first week of classes), allowing them to have a more rounded overview of a class they may be shopping. Also, because it is held on reserve, all students can have equal access to it — no single student can monopolize the book by borrowing it for weeks at a time. Well-intentioned as the policy may be, the three-hour textbook reserve is still highly inefficient. First and foremost, there are clearly some students on campus who can more easily afford to buy their own textbooks, and then there are some who may face greater financial difficulties in doing so. Instead of leaving these books on reserve, then, perhaps libraries could make them available for long-term borrowing by students who are on significant financial aid programs from the University. Or, if libraries decide to allow students to check out course books normally, perhaps the same group of students could be given priority on account of their need (for instance, students on significant financial aid could be allowed to check out course books a day or two before the same books become open to the general student body at the start of each semester). Alternatively, libraries could treat course books as no different than regular books. They will likely be in high demand, but as in any efficient market system, the students who truly value the ability to borrow a book instead of buying it will be the first ones to retrieve it from the libraries’ shelves. Some may argue that this system is inherently unfair because it prevents everyone from having equal access to the books, but in principle, this system of lending books is no different than the way in which the Frist Campus Center currently handles ticket sales. In either case, simply having the books out of libraries and in the hands of the students who need them would be a much better use than having them lie on the shelves, waiting for students to borrow them, three-hours at a time. Ultimately, libraries should not discriminate between textbook or not. The current three-hour reserve policy hinders libraries from fully achieving one of its most basic functions — lending out books to students — and is just an inefficient system that should be modified to more accurately represent student needs.|~|Jason Choe is a sophomore from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

68013|~|I judge you, and that's okay |~|   September 21 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|The first day of my study abroad program in Morocco was the usual combination of awkward mingling and useless information sessions. After I suffered through a series of hour-long information sessions coordinated by the Institute for the International Education of Students in Rabat (not a Princeton affiliate), only one nugget of wisdom stayed with me throughout the four months of my North African experience — and only because I found it so offensively misleading. The best traveler, we were told, is she who experiences foreign cultures without judging. Separating your own beliefs and values from those you encounter in a new country is a sign of open-minded sophistication. Check your opinions at the door; this is a safe space, a no-criticism cultural observation zone. We were never told at what point a good traveler turns her judgment back on. Perhaps she never does — she just wanders through the world recording facts and noting differences between societies without ever checking the information she gathers against any kind of baseline of personal values. Listening to her expound upon marital practices in Tanzania or religious demographics in Australia is like consulting an encyclopedia — informative, surely, but not the kind of intellectual stimulation you seek out unless you’re working on a relevant academic research project. To my mind, at least half of the value of study abroad lies in first surviving, then embracing the clash between your own value system and a foreign one. A meeting of worlds is only productive if you acknowledge and evaluate the contradictions between them. Acknowledgment without evaluation entirely misses the point. Study abroad is an opportunity to tweak, reject or strengthen your old ideas by exposure to new ones. This is why I (very judgmentally) decided on my first day in Morocco that my program directors were not going to be my travel gurus. To some extent, I heard echoes of my Princeton experience in the “travelers don’t judge” mantra. Here, though, “travelers” is replaced with “friends.” Judging your peers has somehow become the cardinal sin of young liberal social etiquette. “Don’t judge me” is one of the most familiar refrains on campus. We are expected not only to reserve or suspend judgment on our neighbor’s religious beliefs or life choices, we are urged to completely efface our own views lest our opinions hurt someone else’s feelings. We’ve adopted a moral relativist standard: You do your thing, I’ll do mine, and who’s to say which is right? In doing so, however, we’re willfully ignoring the fact that moral relativism is a rigid value system in its own right. As a self-proclaimed judger, I strongly take issue with the values of a relativist philosophy and deplore its stranglehold on campus culture. I judge relativists. I judge their views first and their characters second, because I see a strong element of hypocrisy in a system that exerts a smothering social pressure on those who dare to judge others. The judgers of our generation are being held on trial, and in consequence we are producing increasingly insipid communities where “some of my best friends” are x, y or z — but the identities and personal beliefs that create these diverse factors are conversational taboos only to be handled while wearing kid gloves and half-embarrassed smiles of loving tolerance. We have not succeeded in banishing judgment. We have only muted it. There are times when it’s legitimate to ask me to stifle my criticism. When a friend tells me not to judge her dance moves or her tendency to mix ketchup into her macaroni and cheese, I find the request eminently reasonable. It’s really none of my business what she puts on her noodles and maintaining a straight face during her Beyoncé imitations can only be beneficial for our friendship. When, on the other hand, a friend demands my complete and unquestioning acceptance of her moral, ethical, sexual and religious values, that relationship becomes a sterile, perfunctory affair. My closest friends judge me. Although they may pretend otherwise, distant acquaintances judge me, too. An untold number of evenings dedicated to discussing and challenging these judgments separates the first category from the second. Judge, and share your judgment. Be honest. Be ruthless. Good travelers and real friends are those who contribute to a worldwide conversation about what is right or whether there is a right in the first place. Through protracted conversations that clarify our own positions, we learn more about the strangers we live among and, ironically enough, get a little closer to that utopia of acceptance that the relativist judge-me-nots are preaching. We can and should demand informed, rational, excellent judgments, criticisms and arguments that are free from malice or ignorance. No one, however, has the right to demand that I shut off my mind for the sake of his or her insecurities. I wouldn’t if I could. So the next time you add, “Don’t judge me” to a description of your religious conversion or your future career plans, don’t mistake my shrug for acquiescence. It’s just a passive-aggressive symbol of how strongly I judge you for asking.|~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio.  She can be reached at twenger@princeton.edu. 
68028|~|Editorial: Campus summer housing improvements|~|   September 21 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Though the start of the semester marks most students’ first time on campus since May, many students remained in Princeton over the summer, conducting research or working at other on-campus jobs.  The vast majority of students remaining in Princeton in the summer stay in dormitories, as other housing is expensive and in short supply.  Though the availability of this option makes remaining in Princeton easier, the Editorial Board believes that the summer housing system could better accommodate students staying on campus over the summer, especially considering that summer housing students are working at the University or participating in University-related programs. In particular, the Board recommends that students be given greater access to air-conditioned rooms, as well as the option to remain on campus through the start of the school year. Since students must seek department approval as part of the application for summer housing, those who stay in dorms are always on campus for programs sponsored or sanctioned by the University. Several departments, notably molecular biology and chemistry, allow and even encourage students to remain on campus over the summer to conduct thesis research.  Several Princeton-sponsored internship programs, including research fellowships and the Princeton Environmental Institute’s internship program, require participants to remain on campus as well. Further, some athletes remain on campus to train for the upcoming school year and to work campus jobs to pay for housing. Given that University programs facilitate these students’ presence on campus, the Editorial Board believes that the University should take more efforts to accommodate these students. Despite the hot New Jersey summers, most students on campus are not offered rooms with air-conditioning. The Manager of Undergraduate Housing, Angela Hodgeman, explained in correspondence with the Board that Housing and Real Estate Services determines the rooms students can use after Conference and Events Services allocates rooms to various summer programs. Hodgeman further stated that there was “limited air-conditioned space” on campus, making it impossible to accommodate summer students. While the Board understands that not all students would be able to access air-conditioned rooms, we believe that the University should value its students over guests who use the campus over the summer. Summer housing could expand the number of rooms offered in Bloomberg Hall, as well as offer students the chance to live in Whitman College and other Butler College buildings, all of which are air-conditioned. Another problem summer residents face is the time between the end of summer housing and the start of the school year. Given that it is financially prohibitory to travel home for some students, many have resorted to temporarily living in eating clubs or, in one case, living out of a car. Hodgeman explains that summer housing ends on or before Aug. 15 for all programs to allow for the “vast turnover process” that takes place before the school year. However, the Board suggests that students be allowed to live in their upcoming school year room in the summer or at least for the last part of August, preventing the need for any turnover in that room. This would further solve the other expensive issue for students who live on campus over the summer: short-term storage. The only currently available option is the Moving and Storage Agency’s short-term storage solution, which charges $20 per box, almost twice the cost of storing for the entire summer. While the Board understands the need for the University to provide housing to participants of summer programs, we believe that the University should continue its long-standing tradition of focusing on its undergraduates by giving them priority when summer rooms are allocated and by allowing students to remain on campus until the start of classes.|~|
67863|~|Lessons from the inside |~|   September 18 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|This past summer, I had the pleasure of working for the New York City Police Department. Aside from the valuable career experience I received, I took away much more than just another notch on my resume. While the experience would have been eye-opening regardless of the circumstances, this happened to also be an extremely eventful and controversial summer for police and law enforcement in general. Sparked by the multiple incidents in Ferguson, Miss., as well as by a handful of other incidents across the United States, the police have come under tremendous scrutiny in the past months by both the media and the public. In particular, a good many of my closest friends and media personalities have spoken out and broadly criticized police officers in the wake of these incidents. I can’t help but wonder if I would be as vehemently outraged at law enforcement as others had I not had the opportunity to observe these events unfold from the inside. Instead, I had a very unique perspective, albeit biased, knowing the details of how these kinds of events typically unfold, told by the very people who experience them on a daily basis. Now, I certainly don’t believe police officers to be infallible, completely free from wrongdoing or free of bias and discrimination, far from it. Police officers are after all, only human. If anything, I learned that there are a lot of problems, at least in my opinion, with the way police are trained and managed. However, I’ve heard numerous criticisms of police behavior recently that are misguided, ignorant and just plain untrue. At the very least, I want to take an opportunity to explain the facts as I have observed them first hand. First and foremost, as I’ve said before and cannot emphasize enough, police officers are only human. This means a few things. This means that they make mistakes. It is unreasonable for the public to expect robot-like perfection and precision, especially during the tremendously fast-paced nature of a shootout. Despite what you see in the movies, the average shootout lasts a blazingly fast two seconds, nowhere near enough time to critically analyze every move. That said, police officers’ high level of success without lethal force is astounding. While the incidents that go wrong are at the forefront of every website and newsfeed, the incidents that are resolved professionally and peacefully on a daily basis are rarely acknowledged. This is not to say what happened to Michael Brown was an accident, or that the officer did not make any mistake. I refuse to pass judgment on the incident because it is so distorted with sensationalism that the truth of the matter is probably long gone. Regardless, police officers do make mistakes, as does every human. However, humanity isn’t necessarily bad. This means that police officers are, for the most part, well-intentioned and kind-hearted people. They aren’t military drones. They aren’t egotistical power nuts. They are people who want to make the world a safer place and dedicate their lives to doing so. This summer, I met some of the kindest and most selfless people I have ever known, but I also met assholes. It is important to remember that mistakes are made by both the kind ones and the rude ones. To break up the banality of office life, the summer interns occasionally had days off to see different areas of the department. These included a tour of the 911 call center and a full six-hour ride-along in the worst precinct in The Bronx, complete with bulletproof vest and a full dose of reality. Perhaps one of the most informative experiences I had, however, was the day I spent at the shooting range. This included a two-hour discussion with the head instructor and some hands-on experience. While some of the discussion came off as overly defensive of police actions and clearly biased, there was real value in the experience. One major criticism of Michael Brown’s shooting was the six shots found in his body. Countless friends of mine expressed outrage at this, whereas I actually admired the amount of restraint the officer showed. In reality, when any typical person begins to fire a weapon, there is a very real human tendency to continue pressing the trigger until the magazine is empty. The combination of fear and adrenaline in life-threatening situations takes control and, in a matter of two or three seconds, 16 shots have been fired. So real is this tendency that officers must go through extensive training to resist the urge to fire excessive amounts of shots once they or their partner begin shooting. Here’s a quick anecdote for you. The interns were given the chance to use the Firearms Training Simulator, which consists of real-life recorded scenarios encountered by officers reenacted by actors. Each participant is given a simulated weapon and told to act as an officer. My scenario consisted of a car accident followed by a physical altercation between the drivers, one of whom was almost beaten to death, despite multiple commands from me and my partners to stop immediately. Even knowing I was in a simulation, my heart raced, sweat poured from my forehead, my hands trembled under the weight of the heavy pistol as I stood there, having the power of life or death at the tip of my finger. Even fully justified in my action of shooting, I could never imagine the pain of knowing that I had decided to end somebody’s life. The simulation after mine consisted of a man threatening an infant with a knife. Within the course of three seconds, the four participants released a total of 73 shots. When asked how many shots they had used after the simulation, their best guess was 15-20. The amount of self-control and professionalism exhibited by police officers is nothing short of astounding. You may ask: With all of this training and self-control, why six shots? Why not just one? The truth of the matter is that the Hollywood image of the hero lining up a shot and taking down a target with a well-placed shot through the head is complete nonsense. Who knew? In reality, one bullet wound is only lethal in about 30 percent of incidents. This almost never happens at the scene. A single bullet from a handgun is rarely enough to stop anybody. Again, adrenaline is enough to make most individuals never even realize that they are shot. Once an officer has decided that somebody’s life is in jeopardy, the primary objective is to stop the perpetrator at all costs, and one bullet is never enough. It’s OK to criticize. It’s OK to want to see a change in the way we police ourselves. However, don’t presume malicious intention simply because the person is wearing a badge.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a computer science major from Pittsburgh, Pa.

67828|~|Editorial: Join the Editorial Board|~|   September 18 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Over the past semester, the unsigned editorials featured on this page have discussed issues such as increased transparency in forced mental health withdrawals, defining a University marijuana policy and investigating gender pay discrepancy at Princeton. The Daily Princetonian Editorial Board, a group of 15 undergraduates, was collectively responsible for writing these pieces. The members of the Board are not the editors of the various sections of the ‘Prince.’ Instead, they constitute an independent group of undergraduate students who are charged with determining the position of the newspaper as a whole. Today, instead of taking a stance on an issue, we would like to explain the editorial process and invite interested freshmen, sophomores and juniors to apply to join the Board. The Board is the independent body responsible for determining the position of the ‘Prince’ on a range of matters that affect Princeton, its campus community and our generation. We meet twice a week to discuss campus issues, solicit input from potential stakeholders and ultimately determine the stance the ‘Prince’ will take on the issue at hand. We work closely with other sections of the newspaper to gather information about editorial topics, but we deliberate behind closed doors and independently determine our own positions to preserve objectivity. The Board answers only to its chair, Jillian Wilkowski; the opinion editor, Sarah Schwartz; and the editor-in-chief, Marcelo Rochabrun. While the Board strives for unanimity, editorial positions are determined by majority vote, and members take turns writing editorials. The majority opinion is signed collectively by the Editorial Board rather than the individuals who concurred with the position of the majority. The minority can also publish a dissent that will bear the names of the individuals dissenting, when they are particularly passionate about the issue. All majority opinions are the collective product of the Board and constitute an independent voice separate from other sections of the ‘Prince.’ Crucial to our mission is the ability to incorporate a variety of diverse perspectives into the editorials we produce. Current Board members come from across the globe and represent a wide variety of majors, political philosophies, and academic and extracurricular interests. What unites us is an engagement in campus life, and a commitment to investigating and discussing issues pertaining to the University community. We are committed to bringing compelling arguments and perspectives to this page, criticizing and praising in equal measure. We try to recommend specific policies or actions for the University that, in our opinion, are best for the community as a whole. For us, its members, the Board is one of the defining activities of our time at the University. From the (relative) comfort of our fourth-floor conference room, we engage in challenging, passionate and intellectually stimulating debates that lead us to examine and confront the full range of issues that affect our lives at Princeton. It is especially exciting when our suggestions make a lasting contribution to broader campus discussions about an issue, or when the University adopts them, such as the computer science department’s decision to keep the pass/D/fail option available for COS 126: General Computer Science, and the Honor Committee’s decision to modify its punishment for students who take extra time on tests. Our aim is to inspire discussion and, ultimately, action. However, this is impossible without students with unique perspectives — independent thinkers who are eager to debate and willing to engage with issues important to Princeton. We value writing ability, creativity and strength of thought much more than journalistic experience. If you are interested in joining us, we encourage you to fill out our application by midnight on Wednesday, Sept. 24. Applicants will be interviewed shortly thereafter. We look forward to meeting you!  |~|
67847|~|Feeling old and being young|~|   September 18 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|Watching my little brother pack his belongings into the car before his freshman year of college as I did the same on the cusp of my senior year, I felt old. That first day at Princeton seemed like whole lifetimes ago. In the years between then and now, my perception of myself and the world, and my place in that world, had changed tremendously and constantly. And now, here I was, the pseudo-responsible adult, telling my brother to be smart and safe, and to make good decisions — the same hollow mantra I’d only half-heard through the haze of my excitement three years earlier. When he texted me that weekend with a simple and yet all encompassing, “I love college,” I realized that, although we both loved our respective universities, my love was tinged with a premature nostalgia, a love of something that already seemed past. I felt old. I said these words to my friend Anna Gordon of McGill University — a brilliant, profoundly insightful friend I might add — expecting her to agree, as every other rising and graduated senior had done in the past few weeks. Instead, she replied, “But don’t you also feel so young?” Of course, I was well aware that 21 is not actually old, even if I felt so. However, I continued to disagree. There was but one year left before those mystical, long-awaited and quickly-fleeting “best years of our lives” were behind us, and we would never be as fun, reckless or free as we were in this moment, at this age. What an awful thing. However, Gordon was not so easily brought into the depths of communal despair. Instead, she explained that I was looking at it all wrong. Growing up is a process, not of passing through ages, but of accumulating them. Therefore, to be 21 also means that one is all the ages that came before. We are at once 20 and 16 and 10 and 5. We don’t grow out of an age, shed that number to move onto the next; rather, we amass ages. Consequently, my default age is 21 as defined by society, but that does not mean I can never see those other states again. In this way, 21 is not really that old at all, as the majority of the years we have amassed before it are quite young. Her theory may not be scientifically correct or even logically perfect, but I think it is the most beautiful way to look at the precarious in-between phase in which I find myself. It guarantees that the future will bring change, new perspectives and evolution certainly, but will also leave me with the choice to be, every once in a while, the 21-year-old I am now. My foremost worry for the next few years is that real life will erode the wonderful things that I possess in this moment — a sense of wonder, a bit of wanderlust, spontaneity, the ability to take myself less than seriously, pleasure in doing absolutely nothing. As young people, we look at some adults and wonder where along the way they lost these things, and I wonder if I’m destined for the same fate. However, to acquire ages, as my friend describes it, gives one permission to revisit another time and to briefly shed the expectations of his or her current age. When I ride airplanes, I hold my mom’s hand for good luck as the plane takes off, and, in those moments, I am 5. The dark basement still scares me every so often because I am 8. I dress up with nowhere to go because I am 10. I get butterflies in my stomach when a cute boy looks at me for a moment too long because I am 13. I think I am older than I am and fight with my mom who knows best but whom I cannot admit that to because I am 16. I want to go out, have fun and make stupid decisions because I am 20. I have big dreams because I am 21. That is who I am right now — a conglomerate of every age I’ve been, with nothing truly lost or that far behind me. And that makes me feel very young.|~|Chelsea Jones is an English major from Ridgefield, Conn. She can be reached at chelseaj@princeton.edu.

67783|~|Streamline university websites|~|   September 18 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|n any institution as large and complex as the University, a network of departments, offices, councils, organizations, programs, and commissions are needed to carry out essential functions. Such an intricate bureaucracy is by nature hard to navigate, and I wouldn’t hesitate to wager that almost no one here at the University could name all or even most of these organizations. For example, Conference and Events Services is different from Meetings and Convention Services, there are at least 3 separate University websites for International travel, and student funding (though now under the umbrella site of the Student Activities Funding Engine) still involves a patchwork of different offices, commissions, funds, departments and programs. Arguing that we should streamline these services is not my point here, and would require a degree of specificity not likely to be achieved in 800 words. But streamlining access to these services can indeed be done and ought to be. The most direct way in which we can do this is by creating a more efficient system for navigating the insane number of University and university-affiliated websites. Currently, the University’s homepage maintains an “A to Z” list of websites which can be filtered according to 5 categories (Academics, Administration, Arts, Research, and Sports). On the A section alone, there are 66 websites referenced, linking to services as different from each other as Accounts Payable and Acción Puertorriqueña. This system is hard to navigate unless you already know the specific site you need (in which case you probably don’t use the A to Z list anyways), and if you don’t know where to go on the site, scrolling through the A to Z list involves scanning hundreds of individual sites, which is simply impractical. Instead, I propose the University should organize its site hierarchically, similar to the folder systems on everyone’s computer. This would allow visitors to browse for the site they’re looking for for a given service (e.g. “Where do I go to register an event with ODUS?”), instead of relying on Google or the archaic A to Z list. For example, the site map could start with the categories used and others (Academic, Administration, Extracurricular, Athletic, etc.), and then upon clicking on one of these categories, a flow-chart style listing of websites would appear which the user could further refine through sub-categories. This change may not seem important, but in fact it is one of the most basic steps the University could take to ensure students and others can take full advantage of all the services and opportunities available to them here. Especially for new freshmen, who don’t come in knowing about SAFE, the Integrated Course Engine, easyPCE and the myriad other useful sites like them, providing a more top-down, hierarchical organization to University websites makes ease of access more universal. For instance, before selecting their first courses in the fall, instead of relying on the chance they hear about easyPCE from an upperclassman friend or discover the residential colleges’ “Favorite Courses” sites, freshmen would be able to navigate through a hierarchical listing. This could include perhaps, Academics to Courses to Course Selection, which would list several sites like the Registrar’s Course Offerings page, easyPCE, the college “Favorite Courses” listings, the academic advising program sites and the sites of the college academic deans, among others. This would mean in practice that the full range of resources available to students would be utilized right out of the gate in freshman year and would help students make better decisions about their first classes to take by taking advantage of the full slate of opinions, reviews, etc. that could affect their decision. Presumably, these offices and services are there for a reason, and if they have a website they probably do some kind of public interfacing, serve “customers” (i.e. students, faculty, and visitors), or at least provide information useful to readers of the site. Thus the aim of having publicly available information and services is better achieved not by maintaining a loose, disorganized apparatus of sites across the University’s domain, but by having an easy-to-navigate folder-like system in which users can find the office whose service they need without having to already know it. This isn’t a column in which I’ll argue for a controversial or sweeping change to a fundamental way in which the University conducts itself. This simply is a recommendation for a simple fix to a small problem, that would make everyday life that much easier for students, faculty, and others without requiring much in the way of resources to solve. But small problems are worth fixing, because in this case it has an outsized practical effect in the lives of students. Many of the columns I and others write propose changes that simply will never come. This is not that type of column, but instead a moderate, legitimately-feasible proposal that would make life for students easier at minimal cost.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a sophomore from Westwood, Mass.

67781|~|Activities fair: bigger but not better|~|   September 18 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ali Akram Hayat|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|As you approach the building, you see fellow freshmen buzzing around. Some are alone, while others approach with awkwardly assembled friends from OA/CA and zee groups, still not quite there yet in the friendship dynamic but desperately trying. The whole atmosphere is buzzing. The Activities Fair really is a showcase for the University to strut the glut of student groups it facilitates and funds and an opportunity for students to pitch for their organizations and recruit potential members. It’s a festival-like environment, with dance groups performing, sports clubs donning their jerseys and Quipfire! parading in their red shirts, probably saying funny things. Everyone seems warm: The groups welcome one and all, irrespective of talent levels, and the students consider the myriad choices in front of them. A precursor for the four years ahead, it seems. Not quite. With two years of experience and three separate Activities Fairs under my belt, my outlook on the fair and what it represents is a tad more cynical. There are two major factors contributing to this. First, the now widely documented idea of false representation about the levels of competition for joining a large chunk of student organizations. Walk by the Nassoons’ table in Dillon Gymnasium on that first Friday, and the smiles on members’ faces will be wide and genuine enough to convince you that you don’t need to be the next Pavarotti to be one of them. While that is still probably true, the skill level required to be a Nassoon, or dance for disiac, or get a role in the Shakespeare Company’s fall show is incredibly high. That itself is not a problem, and perhaps something one should expect from a college such as ours. However, the false advertisement of their accessibility feels like cheating. As an addendum, it would be heartening to see more groups with reduced or no skill levels required for entry. After all, college is as much about learning new skills as it is about polishing current ones. The Lobster Club is a good start, and hopefully others groups will follow suit. The more systematic issue with the fair again has to do with being misled. A quick, cursory glance around Dillon will make it easy to conclude that there is a very large number of student organizations. Yet, a closer (and more critical) look offers interesting insight. There is very little diversity among the categories of organizations. Take out the four broad categories of performing arts, sport clubs, political activities and finance/business-related groups, and students are left with very limited options. This does not mean that there aren’t other avenues of activity on campus. There is a botany club, an anime club, a film society and even a brewers’ society. A comparison of the size and scale of these organizations, however, both in terms of membership and funding, with their more established counterparts in the ‘big four’ outlined above, shows a clearer picture. Student organizations, meant to be avenues for channeling student interest in fields beyond coursework, are too narrow in their scope. There is one very intuitive justification for this. These organizations did not descend from another community. They are the student-created, student-run and student-managed, and only exist insofar as the student community takes interest in them. The fact, then, that certain groups are more popular than others is simply the result of student demand for them. There are two issues with this. First, student demand is not an adequate justification. In a lot of cases, demand is not directly caused by interest and is more influenced by how exclusive a group is (think back to the Wilson School when it required admission by application), which tends to make competitive Princeton students pine for it more. Moreover, the relationship between the organizations and the student community is not one-way; it is a reflexive system, in which student demand not only determines but is also determined by current student organizations. When entering a culture with numerous dance groups and more business organizations than residential colleges, students are more inclined to ‘develop’ an interest for them. Second, from the University’s point of view, student demand is not the only parameter by which decisions should be made. There should be a more proactive stance on student organizations to help mold demand and interest in ways more in conjunction with University aims, one of which must be a more diverse set of activities. As an example, the Pace Center for Civic Engagement activities fair outside Dillon is a great initiative, but it is important to not let it branch out as a fifth “big” category, leading us back to square one. That will be the peril with any attempt at diversifying unless we reach a stage where there is such a large number of popular categories of activities that a sense of diversity is achieved almost by default. Until then, most of the excitement around the Activities Fair will remain specious.|~|Ali Akram Hayat is a philosophy major from Lahore, Pakistan. He can be reached at ahayat@princeton.edu.  
67779|~|No more nominations|~|   September 18 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|As of Aug. 29, 2014, the ALS Association proudly reported having received $100.9 million from over three million donors within a month, thanks to this summer’s viral Ice Bucket Challenge. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, is a disease in which the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord results in muscle weakness and atrophy. This often leads to total paralysis and death within two to five years. In the campaign to find a cure, many non-profits, such as Project A.L.S., have adopted the Ice Bucket Challenge, posting it onto their front pages and turning it into a trending social media phenomenon that gathers more supporters each day. However, despite having had an impressive run with no signs of slowing down any time soon, the Ice Bucket Challenge has its critics — and rightfully so. Even though CNN.com commends the challenge as a manifestation of the “power of the peer-to-peer economy, driven by young people,” the challenge ultimately reinforces the problems in how our generation approaches activism and giving to donor-dependent organizations. Since the ALS Association neither constructed nor actively enlivened the Ice Bucket Challenge, we’re the ones who should accept the responsibility for the long-term flaws of this activist campaign. For one, while the ALS Association itself would most likely appreciate a donation of any amount, the ice bucket challenge seems to demand the donation of $100, turning away young people such as college students who originally might have been interested in contributing to the cause. Considering that young adults are a huge demographic of the challenge, it certainly doesn’t help that the viral trend started and peaked in the summer, right before students are having to deal with expenses such as tuition, room and board, meal plans and textbooks. Facebook users who resort to the free ice-dumping video alternative still reap the social rewards of ‘likes’ and comments, but the ALS Association has lost a potential donation. For those who choose this alternative, the Ice Bucket Challenge asks very little from its participants. One donor cycle merely involves the nominator providing a 1-2 sentence description about ALS, a link to the ALS Association’s webpage, a nomination of three other individuals and the light-hearted threat of 24 hours for challenge completion on the social media setting of his or her choice. There is almost too much simplicity in the sequence from being nominated on social media to actually submitting your donation. Because of the “I dare you” nature of the challenge, nominees will be less concerned with verifying the efficiency of the charity organization, researching the disease itself or learning about more ways to actively contribute to the cause beyond a single installment of $100. While researching might end up driving away people who are unsatisfied with an organization’s efficiency, it ultimately creates informed donors who are more likely to stay committed to the cause. This is another problem with the Ice Bucket Challenge: Its thinly veiled connection to ALS is that it doesn’t involve an aggressive follow-through. Charities usually do this by asking first-time donors if they want to join a newsletter or apply for a membership. Since the Ice Bucket Challenge doesn’t even make an effort to maintain donors’ interest after it’s completed, the donor retention time is basically the 24 hours — a single cycle. Possibly the worst of the Ice Bucket Challenge’s shortcomings is that its results are not reproducible. It probably won’t be renewed again next year as “Ice Bucket Challenge Part 2”. If someone creates a spin-off of it, the new version probably won’t be nearly as successful as the original Ice Bucket Challenge. So even if other charity organizations manage to come up with new challenge ideas, they’ll have to deal with the reality that people aren’t likely to participate in consecutive challenges within a certain time period. As Tom Murphy says in his article, “Why I’m not doing the #icebucketchallenge or donating for ALS”, the new “reality of fundraising” is the “hype cycle” — how long a campaign can succeed before it’s replaced by a new viral trend and permanently goes “off the radar”. In spite of its good intentions, the Ice Bucket Challenge is ultimately a nod to the short attention span of the social network generation. It trains organizations to figure out ways to cater toward lower levels of commitment and the public’s love affair with slacktivism. The truth is that even if charities manage to continue with the surge campaign philosophy, only so many organizations will be able to benefit from this practice before the public hits a plateau of apathy. It’s only a matter of time before someone says, “Thanks for the nomination, but there’s no one left to nominate” and frankly, we should be able to do better than that.  |~|Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major from Irvine, California.

67611|~|Princeton: physics, philosophy and pornography|~|   September 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|You need to go to college. You have to get an education to be successful. You must have a neat, little degree on your wall to get a job. It’s always an ultimatum, and it seems almost ubiquitous for our generation and the ones that will follow: Without a college degree, employment in the modern economy is virtually unattainable. And yet CollegeBoard, the very gatekeeper of universities, reports that the average tuition and fees bill from a public, four-year university has increased beyond the rate of inflation by 27 percent in just the last five school years; the average for private universities like Princeton is still a staggering 14 percent increase since the 2008-09 school year. But fear not. There are a few positions available to some college students who, faced with the decision either of crushing student debt or forsaking the safety of a college education, can earn hundreds of dollars an hour for work and for only a few hours a week. Alluring, not only because the high rate will quickly put a decent dent in tuition bills (especially compared to minimum-wage jobs, or even $12 an hour university jobs) but also because the low hours of work expected per week fit easily into a college student’s strictly regimented schedule. Any student, too, can find plenty of just such jobs on a website like Sexyjobs.com. Duke student Miriam Weeks — known on the Internet as Belle Knox — was one such student faced with the “College Dilemma.” So is an unnamed, male Columbia student. Both decided that taking one of the jobs you might encounter on SexyJobs.com was preferable to entrenching themselves in more and more student debt. Weeks is a porn star; the Columbia student is a “Boyfriend Experience Escort.” (For clarification purposes, both of these activities are technically legal. The pornography industry — as long as all acts involved are consensual — is a legal one, while the more shadowy world of escorts tiptoes around the law by explicating that any money exchanged is for the escort’s time, not his/her services). Both are from that strata of students too rich for enough aid but too poor to pay the bill. Usually, if someone told me that what’s-her-name is doing porn or that so-and-so is an escort, I would shrug and ask “so what?” If that’s what they want to do, if they have no moral qualms about it, who am I to impose any moral guidelines of my own upon them? But when students trying to get the best education they can are pigeonholed into the sex industry — with all its stigmas — I get upset. Both Weeks and the Columbia student write about their employment with a tone of pride and ownership, but both of their accounts implicate their high tuition bills as the impetus for their entrance into the adult employment sector. Whether or not either of these students now enjoys what he/she does is beside the point. What these students’ narratives have brought to light is the element of coercion from the American university system and from American society that have forced Weeks and the Columbia student, as well as all students, to consider such means to pay their way to a degree. It is entirely irresponsible of policy makers (nothing new, from Washington) and the university system to have allowed their students to assume potentially lifelong stigma so that they may continue attending classes. I am not saying, however, that pornography or escort services are shameful jobs or that these students have lowered themselves in any way by entering such industries. In fact, Weeks and her counterpart’s experiences are far more embarrassing to the universities than to the students themselves. Instead of giving students viable options to help finance the education that everyone has told them they needed, universities and the government have forced them to consider options deemed immoral by most of society. And now Weeks (and, if he is found out, the Columbia student) must face the possibility of her potential future employers diminishing her degree because of the very method she used to pay for it. It is not, then, the actual industries that Weeks and the Columbia student entered that appalls me. It is the underlying idea that, in order to finance an education, some students must accept opportunities they usually would never consider, with potentially lifelong consequences. This is what we should focus on from Weeks’ story. Either college costs must stop rising, or we must reconsider the emphasis we place on college education. That is the ultimatum we, as a society, face. And we, like Weeks and others like her, must find a way.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a sophomore from Phoenix, Ariz.

67601|~|Soft chauvinism|~|   September 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|My first day in Morocco, I was uncomfortable. After three days, I was angry. By the end of the week, I was more than ready to try out one of those female-only dystopian societies that science fiction writers find so captivating. True, I love my dad and left some good guy friends behind me at Princeton, but in the first violent throes of my indignation, these seemed reasonable sacrifices to make in exchange for the annihilation of all male catcallers everywhere. I had prepared myself in advance for this critical cultural difference of my semester abroad program — namely, the widespread North African perception that a single woman, especially a foreigner, who appears in the street by herself is fair game for the sexual advances of every horny male she encounters. Reading articles about how to ignore catcalls, however, is a very different thing from walking through a swarm of teenagers screaming obscenities at the top of their lungs. Halfway through my semester, all of the American students on my program convened for a discussion about gender norms in Morocco. I had heard most of it before: the frustration, the helplessness, the implicit indictment of Near Eastern society. I had not realized, however, that two program participants — girls from Chicago and Philly — considered the levels of harassment in Rabat to be on par with what they regularly experienced at home. I was floored. I can reel off sexist aspects of American society as well as the next feminist: pay inequality, rape culture, media portrayals of female politicians, etc. But the experience I went through in Morocco had seemed so unique, so unbearably over the line, that I could not believe it had a comparable counterpart in the lives of my friends from home. After all, I personally had never experienced this kind of harassment in the States … Except that I have. It doesn’t take the form of strangers shouting expletives at me from street corners or inviting me to sleep with them and their friends (yes, that is exactly what I wanted to do today — how did you know?), but it’s there. A wolf whistle, passing honk or comment about appearance is a familiar and accepted side effect of walking down the street for many American women. And when I say many, I mean pretty much all of the female students reading this column. We turn our heads, some of us smile, and we move on, more or less ignoring the men who felt the need to remind us that they see us first and foremost as aesthetically pleasing objects. My first conscious experience of street harassment was in high school, walking to synagogue by myself down a suburban side street. A portly older gentleman relaxing on his porch called out, “You look very pretty today.” I was flattered — any 14-year-old girl would have been — but I was also old enough to feel uneasy. There was something a wee bit creepy in the way he was looking at me, so I said nothing and hurried on. This was my first exposure to “friendly” catcalling, if there is such a thing. It’s the main kind of harassment in the United States, and it made up the bulk of my street encounters in Morocco, as well. In Rabat I realized that “bad” or unfriendly harassment — men shouting obscenities, inviting women to screw them, etc. — is the flip side of the same coin. Both come from a deeply ingrained gender-based sense of entitlement to public places and women’s bodies. Whether or not women “like” positive comments on their appearances is beside the point. My guy friends are not stopped on the street by unknown women or men who tell them how handsome they look or how fine their ass is. This is not a function of how attractive they are, just as the number of wolf whistles any given woman attracts in her lifetime is not ultimately a comment about her face or body. Catcallers are stroking their own masculine egos by assuming that every woman cares what they think about her clothes and body shape. They are asserting that they, and all men, have the right to pass verbal, public judgment on her. Many also believe that the privilege of their unsolicited attention should be acknowledged by a smile or hey, even a phone number. This is chauvinism. Back in America, the harassment is so comparatively mild I barely notice it. But it’s there, and its ubiquitous presence is a constant reminder that whether I’m in Rabat, Morocco, or Princeton, New Jersey, I can always count on running into a strange man who believes that his gender legitimizes his invasion of my personal space. Don’t be that guy.|~| Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio.  She can be reached at twenger@princeton.edu. 
67563|~|Mentoring at Princeton|~|   September 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|It will not surprise anyone to hear that the majority of the freshmen whom I have met so far have been extremely — and understandably — anxious. I expected that they would be; I know it was certainly difficult and overwhelming for me to make the transition to college and to being surrounded by unfamiliar faces after years with the same people in middle and high school. What was interesting to me is that most of the freshmen I met would only admit to feelings of less than 100 percent glee with Princeton while speaking with me one-on-one or in a group with only other sophomores. Once the group expanded to include other freshmen, things shifted and everything became all sunshine and roses. That is why one of the most important aspects of Princeton is the way people from different class years can meet and mix because it gives freshmen in particular someone to talk to. The dominant culture at Princeton favors a veneer of perfection. Everyone here was at the very top of their high school; they had the grades, and they led the extracurricular activities, and they probably spoke at graduation. Making the transition here — becoming the clueless freshman who does not know how things work and becoming, probably for the first time, completely average — can be a little rough. The easy and comfortable thing to do, particularly with fellow freshmen whom you want to impress, is to pretend that things are still the way they were in high school, that you are still comfortable and on top of the world. This starts to change a little as the year progresses and people start finding their real, close friends, but the transition period can be a little sticky. This is where the older students come in. As a result of the University’s relatively small population, it is virtually impossible to end up not having any classes or being involved in any activities with people in different class years than you. This sets up a perfect opportunity for freshmen to speak with other students who have been through the same experiences and lived to tell the tale. It is easier for freshmen to speak to people from other years because there is not a sense of comparison between freshmen and older students. Among freshmen, there can be a sense of comparison regarding how other people are holding up, leading to feelings of inadequacy if other people seem to be adjusting better or having less trouble with classes. But with older students, there is already an explanation for why they might be put together: They have had a year or more to sort things out. So because freshmen seem to feel a need to keep up a front around one another and do not seem to feel that need with older students, activities and classes where they befriend people from other years are invaluable. They provide an opportunity for freshmen to talk about the stress they are undeniably under, which is very new to them, without the pressure of speaking with someone much older. Although there are programs geared specifically toward providing this sort of relationship, such as the Princeton University Mentorship Program and the Woman’s Mentorship Program, about which I have heard good things, one of the benefits of Princeton is that you can build mentoring relationships organically just by doing what you are interested in and running into upperclassmen that way. This organic method is possibly more effective than participating in official mentoring organizations because it does not require people to go out of their way; that is, instead of having to schedule mentoring time, you can be mentored while doing the activities that you are already engaged in. The environment at the University is undeniably stressful and fast-paced. Classes are difficult, and there is pressure to be highly involved in campus activities. Many students also work. But, even in the context of our overscheduled lives, we have an important resource — the Princeton community. One way we can make sure we are taking advantage of that community is to strengthen inter-class bonds. This is something that has to come from the students, not the University, because it requires us to take initiative. Older students in student-run activities should make a special effort to get to know the freshmen and to check in on them regularly — they are more likely to open up to us than anyone else. Freshmen should try and seek out older students in these same organizations and make an effort to reach out when they need help. The infrastructure is already there in that the small student population ensures we run into each other. It is important to make an effort to utilize that structure, especially for freshmen, but for older students as well.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a sophomore from Fairfax, Va.

67392|~|Confusing cause and symptom |~|   September 15 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Will Rivitz Before I dive into this piece, let’s get one thing out of the way: I fully agree with the central tenet of ‘Prince’ columnist Shruthi Deivasigamani’s column, “Blaming Women.” The disconnect between the blithe “post-gender” attitude our society ostensibly embodies and the massive, hideous underbelly of an American society extremely conducive to sexual harassment and assault is frightening. Op-eds like hers are absolutely necessary because despite the ever-growing U.S. population willing to confront such horrific norms as victim-blaming (especially if said victim is female, as Deivasigamani points out with her comparison between the Vanessa Anne Hudgens and Dylan Sprouse nude photo leaks), there are still countless Americans who obstinately refuse to confront their own bigotry and the toxicity of our country as a whole. That being said, Deivasigamani begins her piece by calling social media aggregating website Reddit “home to … the darkest and slimiest grottos … [of] the Internet.” As someone who frequents its various subcommunities (or subreddits), I feel that this is an unhelpful indictment of the site. Of course, it’s indeed true that many of the site’s nastiest subreddits could only have had the impact that the Internet eventually felt due to much user support, and subreddits like /r/jailbait, /r/creepshots, and most recently /r/thefappening are inexcusable examples of the horrors that the site can enable. What’s more, thanks to the website’s predominantly teenage-male userbase, there’s a fair amount of misogyny that occurs daily, ranging from the obvious (most of the “general use” pornographic subreddits contain almost exclusively female images) to the insidious (using the term “bitch” as a general descriptor of women, for example). However, blaming Reddit as the worst perpetrator of the horrors of the Internet is still unfair, even if a significant percentage of the site’s userbase is responsible, directly or otherwise, for perpetuating countless forms of sexism. The worst parts of the website are not the root cause of misogyny in this country, but symptoms of the problem. At its most basic, the site exists to provide a largely unmoderated forum for users to share content and ideas via a simple upvote-downvote system. More popular opinions and images are upvoted; less popular ones are downvoted. As is clear from the website’s staunch support of net neutrality, Reddit believes in as little authoritative control as possible when it comes to Internet issues. There are a number of problems with this approach — for example, posts fall off the front page if they are not upvoted enough within a few minutes, giving more traction to easy-to-digest click-bait headlines and images rather than in-depth, nuanced articles. But for the most part, this system means that the userbase at large, not the administrators, determine what is displayed prominently and what gets shoved under the rug. This means that the problem is not the site itself, but rather the users who frequent it. Blaming this site specifically, then, is needlessly restrictive. For every horrifically offensive community like /r/foreveralone, there generally is another community in which one might react accordingly against it — for example, /r/twoxchromosomes. What’s more, much of the site’s best content exists as far away from issues of sex and gender as possible. Subreddits like /r/gamedeals, /r/longreads, /r/comicbooks and /r/electronicmusic exist mostly in their own realms, largely separate from the wrongdoings of other parts (which naturally receive more attention from non-Redditors because of their unpleasantness). And what of blaming the site’s administrators and creators for an apology referencing only the illegality of /r/thefappening instead of the creepiness within? The site’s apology is appropriate given its attitude toward user-created-and-vetted content. We wouldn’t have expected Facebook to apologize for the rampant homophobia it enabled around the time of the Duck Dynasty fiasco, and we wouldn’t have expected Twitter to apologize for the chilling xenophobia and racism many users expressed when an Indian-American woman won 2013’s Miss America competition. Reddit’s higher-ups exist to ensure the legality and legitimacy of the site, and nothing more. We expect a hands-off approach from almost all of the social-networking sites we frequent, so why should Reddit be any different?|~|Will Rivitz is a freshman from Brookline, Mass.

67402|~|The contradictions of service|~|   September 15 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|The ALS “Ice Bucket Challenge,” one of the biggest social media trends to sweep across the nation this summer, was also a source of controversy. The “Ice Bucket Challenge” asked participants to film themselves dumping buckets of ice over themselves and post the videos on Facebook in order to encourage awareness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, and then nominate friends to do the same. One of the objections people had to this trend was that it was primarily selfish — sometimes people didn’t donate money, and even if they did, it wasn’t because of interest in ALS, it was because the ice bucket video garnered social media attention for the participant. People also argued that the challenge spread through peer pressure — people who were nominated were pressured to complete the challenge by either creating another video or donating. Moreover, The New Yorker argued that people could have donated instead to a more worthwhile cause, such as malaria, since participants didn’t have any particular attachment to the ALS cause or knowledge about its impact. Because there was an aspect of selfishness about the ALS challenge, people questioned the ethics of the campaign. Looking at charity from this perspective challenges the validity of a lot of other forms of giving or service. One example is ‘voluntourism,’ the act of traveling to another country to volunteer. Many Princeton programs exist that provide housing and funding to participate in international service trips and internships. However, these trips are arguably intended to mainly benefit the student, not the volunteer organization. Students benefit by having experience to put on a resume, learning a new language, gaining a new perspective or just plain having fun. It would be more efficient to use the money spent on buying plane tickets and funding housing to simply pay locals to do the service work. This would have the twofold advantage of boosting the local employment rates while also doing work that benefits the community. Although Princeton students are educated and talented in many ways, they’re not necessarily trained in the volunteer work some regions require, such as building construction or teaching. Like the ALS Challenge, the primary motivation for volunteering abroad is, most likely, not for the volunteering aspect, which introduces inefficiencies. The money will flow to the focus of the program, and the focus in most ‘voluntourism’ cases is not the charity. Other examples of focus on the volunteer rather than the beneficiaries would be any charity event at all, whether it’s a charity ball or a 5K run. The money used to organize the event could easily go directly to the cause. Instead, money is used to promote the event and pay coordinators. However, without the selfish components to each form of charity, it is highly likely that people would not donate at all. That particular issue raises the question — is it better to selfishly volunteer than not to volunteer at all? The same arguments against the ALS challenge also hold with ‘voluntourism’ and expensive charity events — namely that people won’t care about the particular cause because it isn’t the primary reason for their participation. Yet, these events and volunteer trips, like the “Ice Bucket Challenge,” still produce results regardless of how dubious the initial intentions. From July 29 to Aug. 28, the ALS Association raised $98.2 million, compared to $2.7 million in the same period last year. The volunteer trips and volunteer events still raise money and awareness, even if the method is somewhat ineffective. Perhaps making service a completely unselfish act is unreasonable because people need some benefit to themselves in exchange for the sacrifice in time, effort and money. But there may be ways of reducing the selfish aspect of giving. Starting at Princeton, we can offer more summer volunteer opportunities that emphasize service over travel and benefits to the student, perhaps by offering internships locally.  We can promote 5K runs and charity events with more focus on the cause so that students are more aware of what they’re giving to. Maybe by starting with our campus, by offering more information to students and promoting the cause over the benefits to the volunteer, students can start to move away from the selfishness of service.|~|Barbara Zhan is an operations research and financial engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

67400|~|A politically motivated veto? |~|   September 15 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Annually, an estimated 50,000 people die due to exposure to secondhand smoke, according to the American Lung Association. Last week, Gov. Chris Christie had the opportunity to help reduce that number. New Jersey legislative bill S1772, recently placed on his desk, aimed to ban smoking in public parks and at beaches. Ranked 11th in population size nationally, New Jersey is both a home and a tourist destination for millions of Americans. Signing the bill would not only have demonstrated his dedication to public health but also made New Jersey safer for many. Instead, Christie vetoed the bill. Despite overwhelming bipartisan support in both the state assembly and senate, Christie framed his veto on the basis of local rights, disagreeing with the idea that “the state should substitute its judgment for that of our local elected officials or upset the careful balancing of interests that informs the decision-making process at the local level.” Granted, New Jerseyans have a right to smoke. However, a closer look at the proposed law reveals that it would have intentionally included elements of local autonomy. S1772 included a compromise provision that would have allowed local officials to designate up to 20 percent of public parks and beaches as smoking-permitted zones. Despite this, he complained that the bill was a “one-size-fits-all” prescription. In his Conservative Political Action Conference speech earlier in the year, Christie proclaimed, “It’s time for [the Republican Party] to get pragmatic,” arguing that Republicans should place productive pragmatic solutions before ideology. However, in the face of the health benefits, it is hard not to see this move as political maneuvering, rather than upholding small government ideals. His main issue was one of central government imposing its will on local constituencies. Christie highlights how local officials have “thoughtfully considered” such bans before and how they must balance “public health, safety, economics, individual liberties and other relevant factors” in their decision-making. While economics definitely should not be flat-out ignored — nor am I accusing local officials of not considering issues thoughtfully — it seems that the state is much better positioned to address issues of public health involving smoking. The problem is that smoking is rarely an issue of immediacy. Lung damage often does not have consequences until months or years into the future, and the probability of indirect health risks often may seem much less of a concern than producing a strong town budget or increasing tourism. In 2013 alone, New Jersey attracted 87.2 million tourists to the state; tourism is undoubtedly a huge way to vitalize a local economy. However, many of the tourists who visit the state include families with children, who are often the most vulnerable to the toxic fumes created through smoking because children are in the middle of their physical development. Unfortunately, this might not always be addressed as pressingly on a local level. The state, however, is large enough to run a department of health. Local municipalities are already too pressed on resources to dedicate the same attention. Additionally, on a pragmatic level, this bill would not only have protected the health of New Jerseyans but also would have had economic benefits for the state as well. In 2006, the CDC found that $5.6 billion a year was lost in productivity because of the health effects of secondhand smoke. In a time of fragile economic growth nationally, it would seem that Christie, a results-minded governor, would want to do everything in his power to cut waste and increase economic output. Instead of nipping the problem in the bud, this just allows the problem to grow, kicking the can down the road. Often, medical issues addressed much later in life not only require much more treatment but also much higher health expenditures as well. In light of all of these practical benefits and the bipartisan support that the bill had experienced prior to reaching Christie’s desk, it seems puzzling that Christie, who touted his bipartisan nature in his second race for the governorship, would veto such a bill. Although the bill was acceptable among most New Jersey Republicans, such a stance seems to go against the national Republican mindset, largely influenced by the small government Tea Party coalition, which has become prominent in the last five years. Additionally, promoting small government values would be helpful to any Republican candidate in 2016, especially one who might have an issue with being framed as too moderate. Historically, other bills passed with large majorities in both houses and vetoed by Christie — such as a restriction on magazine capacities, a bill to subsidize family clinics and a ban on the locking of pregnant female pigs into cages — have not become law. While it is impossible to know the inner-workings of Christie’s mind, it seems to be valid to ask whether Christie is doing this out of true belief or for personal gain. It would be truly sad if Christie decided to put his own political health before the health of the people he represents.|~|Ben Dinovelli is a Wilson School major from Mystic, Conn.

67321|~|Stop blaming biology|~|   September 14 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|In her Aug. 18 column in the New York Post, Doree Lewak discusses how she views the act of “catcalling” to be an innocuous form of “self-empowerment” for women, saying that it should deliver a “drive-by dose of confidence” rather than being considered something as negative as street harassment. After reading Lewak’s column, I wondered just how common it was for professional or amateur writers as well as online commentators to pass off unacceptable social behavior by saying that it was merely “primal” and has probably existed for centuries, as Lewak did. While scouring through articles on issues such as sexual harassment, the golden standard of physical beauty and the biases of sexual attraction, two phrases seemed to come up the most: “biological programming” and “genetically predisposed.” Whether they came up in the comment sections or in the articles themselves, people seemed to be using these terms to explain, and sometimes justify, how this unacceptable behavior originated and has managed to carry on in modern society. For example, in a conversation about sexual violence prevention, a well-meaning father responded that while he was “100% supportive of the fact that sexual assault is something that should not occur under any circumstances [,] the one area that many women seem to conveniently overlook is that biological studies have shown that the most basic way men get ‘aroused’ and become sexually attracted to women is through visual stimulation.” I get it; “biologically programmed” is a big and flashy phrase, and no one really wants to argue with science (even if the writer of the article was, in reality, grossly uninformed about the subject). However, while I appreciate that members of the scientific community are trying to understand the basis of many human behaviors, I’ve never heard any biologist or anthropologist say in their conclusions that “it makes sense for people to still act that way”, when the behavior was clearly wrong. For example, a BBC forum clip that previewed primatologist John Mitani’s research demonstrated that “even though research with chimpanzees does suggest that the roots of human aggression run deep … it’s important to understand that we can move beyond our biological predispositions.” While learning about testosterone, the evolutionary advantage of certain physical traits and even the dynamics of the hunter-gatherer society is informative and certainly interesting, none of these should be used to absolve anyone of inappropriate and abusive actions. What’s worst is that it seems as though this practice of freeing bad behavior from blame isn’t limited to the conversation around sexual harassment and violence. It extends into other issues such as homophobia, transphobia, and racial discrimination on the basis that “what is different from us must be wrong.” Time and time again, I’ve seen and heard people pass off prejudice by citing that human beings are “biologically inclined” to reject what they don’t understand or what is different from them. Frankly, as an evolutionary biology major, it is simply awful and insulting to hear this field of study exploited in order to excuse ignorance and blatant abuse. Biology should be used as a vehicle for the improvement of life, not as a copout for why things are bad. Furthermore, even if science one day conclusively proves that certain genes are directly linked to specific incorrect behaviors, we should nonetheless make a deliberate effort to counter our biological inclination lest we be slaves to our genes. After all, just because studies have shown that affective empathy — a person’s ability to recognize and respond to other people’s feelings — seems to temporarily decline during mid-adolescence for males doesn’t mean that parents now reluctantly accept or condone teenage angst and rude behavior. In my reading, I came across journalist Esther Honig’s social experiment to have her face photoshopped by people in 26 countries according to their cultures’ standards of beauty. Her transformed photos depicted differences across cultures in the form of makeup, hairstyles, facial structure preference and religious dress. These styles and features that are now considered desirable most likely weren’t in the past; perceptions of beauty changed over time because of social and cultural evolution. So if perspectives on subjects that are as pervasive in daily life as physical attraction can be drastically altered across time and across cultures, then our biology can’t be as rigid as we claim it is. In response to the father who posted on conservative dress for women as sexual violence prevention, David Belt wrote that while all human beings have biological instincts, these “instincts are only a part of our decision making process” and that even “knee-jerk reactions … can be altered and controlled.” By leaving the consideration of “what’s implanted in our genes” out of the conversation when discussing sensitive topics that are more shaped by society and culture and less by biological determinants, we put responsibility back on ourselves, which is, in itself, true self-empowerment.|~|Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major  from Irvine, Calif.

67309|~|Editorial: Transparency in the investigatory procedures of the Honor Committee and Committee on Discipline |~|   September 14 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Last spring, The Daily Princetonian reported on the last USG Senate meeting of the year. While nominees for the Honor Committee and the Committee on Discipline (COD) were being approved, concerns were raised about some of the Honor Committee’s practices. Currently, according to “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities,” “when a report of a suspected violation of the honor system is received, the Honor Committee immediately conducts an investigation.” Yet the exact procedure of the investigatory process is unclear, especially in regards to at what point in time after initial contact students are notified whether they are witnesses or suspects.  Since the constitution of the Honor Committee emphasizes students’ rights to representation and a fair trial, the Editorial Board believes that the suspicion of a discrepancy in the Honor Committee’s investigatory practices merits a transparent review. It is important to note that a similar line of inquiry exists for COD investigations, and the student body should also be aware of the level of promptness in which students are made aware of their positions in COD investigations. The Honor Committee and COD procedures consist of an initial report and investigation, a hearing and, ultimately, a verdict. Upon receiving a report, investigators reach out to witnesses and, sometimes, suspects. Under current practices, students contacted by the committees are not notified in advance of meeting whether they are suspects or witnesses. The issue then arises as to when in the investigatory process students are informed of their position in the case. The Board believes that if students who are suspects are informed of the charges against them after some initial questioning, this harms other students’ rights to a fair investigation and trial and damages the trust that the system is supposedly built on. For cases proceeding to trial, the Honor Committee affords 24 hours of advance notice and representation to students and the COD, when informing the student of the date of their committee hearing, includes the charges against them. This same protocol should be extended to students called in for an investigation. No student should walk into questioning unaware of whether or not they are being suspected of a violation. If students are unaware of the situation or misled to believe they are not being suspected, this could lead to self-incriminating and uninformed statements.  Further, testimony elicited during the initial meeting can be used as one of the two pieces of corroborating evidence necessary to proceed with a hearing. Thus, it is quite possible that self-incriminatory comments could prompt a hearing that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred at all, which seems to be lacking in good faith. The point of the investigation should not be to “trick” students into making statements but rather to conduct a thorough and fair investigation of students who are fully aware of their rights and the charges against them. It can be argued that alleged current practices allow for more accurate fact-finding. After all, if suspects are not aware that they are suspects, perhaps they will be more open with the information that they share. However, as systems based upon trust and integrity, the Honor Committee and COD should not prematurely assume that students who are aware of their status will choose to lie or withhold information. Instead, the committees should protect students from making uninformed and potentially self-incriminating statements. The Board believes that a review of the Honor Committee’s and COD’s investigatory practices will be a step towards improving trust, fairness and transparency in the University disciplinary system.|~|Mitchell Johnston ’15 and Kevin Wong ’17 are recused from the writing of this editorial. 
67287|~|What we talk about when we talk about privacy|~|   September 14 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Cameron Langford|~|None|~|In the midst of rising racial tensions in Ferguson and an encroaching ISIS abroad, summer’s biggest news story might just have been about a group of naked girls. On Aug. 31, a hacker leaked photographs of over 100 celebrities, including “The Hunger Games” actress Jennifer Lawrence and model Kate Upton, on the website 4chan. Most shocking were not the photos themselves (many of which showed women who were at least partially clothed), or that they were obtained from Apple’s ubiquitous iCloud, or even that they so quickly and unapologetically proliferated every corner of the Internet. Most shocking was the hacker’s flagrant violation of privacy and, more perniciously, the way that women’s right to privacy was uniquely targeted. Americans haven’t always considered privacy a right. Indeed, the much-discussed “right to privacy” — a concept that explains American indignation over everything from last summer’s NSA scandal to abortion limitations — wasn’t even part of our legal lexicon until the late 19th century. In 1890, Justice-to-be Louis D. Brandeis coauthored a seminal paper entitled (you guessed it) “The Right to Privacy,” in which he presciently argued, “[T]he law must afford some remedy for the unauthorized circulation of portraits of private persons.” Still, it was not until 1965 that the Supreme Court codified Brandeis’s ideas, deciding in Griswold v. Connecticut that policing contraception violated the “right to marital privacy” and that such a right might be defined as “protect[ion] from government intrusion.” Yet even as the right to privacy has become as central to the American democratic consciousness as the Equal Protection Clause or the right to vote, it continues to hold little water when it comes to female bodies, which have historically been commodified. We all know that sex sells, and that the female sex sells more. It is philosophically but not historically surprising that such a primal, sexist reality, which reduces women to the shape of their breasts and the flatness of their stomachs, could supersede the more compelling right to privacy. Compare the photo scandal to a male counterpart: When three of J.D. Salinger’s unpublished stories were leaked last December, the reaction instead was overwhelmingly one of indignance. While many no doubt viewed the stories, which the author had no intention of making public before his death in 2010, the overall attitude was one of deference to Salinger’s wishes; he didn’t want them seen, and so we as readers felt that we ought not see them. But when hundreds of nude photos of female celebrities went live, few felt the same way. Hell, I scrolled through a few, and chances are that you did too. The question is why. Why do we put our own right to view naked photos of these women — most of whom are funny, smart and enjoyable to look at even with their clothes on, in outfits they curated for public viewing — above their right to privacy? Why have we invented a right to see that holds more weight than a Constitutional right not to be seen? Surely, you might argue, those who send nude photos or make sex tapes are simply asking for a public relations scandal, no? Perhaps. But there is a big difference between posting nude photos anonymously on a website and being discovered, say, and sending private photos to your significant other on a private device. The intent of the former is to be seen; the intent of the latter is for one specific person to see. Ultimately, it boils down not to sex but to consent. We are simultaneously scandalized and fascinated by these photos not because they contain naked women, which are never more than a Google search away, but because they contain women who did not consent to be seen naked. Or at least, not by us. When shared without permission, nude photos become about much more than bodies. They become about power. Power that we, the viewers, hold. Power that the hacker holds. And power that men have held and continue to hold over women in modern America. Ultimately, the right to privacy is a protection against the abuse of power by institutions that are bigger and stronger than the individual. For women — even those as critically acclaimed and financially successful as many of the leak’s victims — that institution is sexism, plain and simple. And that is an institution, indeed.|~|Cameron Langford is a politics major from Davidson, N.C. She can be reached at cplangfo@princeton.edu.

67171|~|Editorial: Instituting a sexual assault prevention program |~|   September 11 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Before the academic year began, the University administration made important progress in strengthening the University’s stance against sexual assault on campus. Chief among these is the recent recommendation by the internal Faculty Advisory Committee on Policy that the University lower its standard for the burden of proof in cases of sexual assault from the policy of “clear and persuasive” to that of a “preponderance” of guilt. Additionally, the University announced that students would no longer serve on committees handling sexual assault cases. Having repeatedly advocated for reforming the University’s sexual assault disciplinary policies, the Editorial Board strongly supports the Committee’s recommendation. However, it is important to restate that there is more to be done to protect Princeton students from sexual assault. While these new policies represent an important step in the right direction in terms of appropriately and adequately punishing perpetrators of sexual assault, we believe that the University must not stop at punishment, but further turn its focus to increasing prevention and reporting of sexual assault. Over the past two years, the Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education program has done much to promote bystander intervention following a general trend in sexual assault activism that champions primary prevention as a central way to address sexual violence. New programming has included the introduction of online sexual assault training for freshmen. SHARE also offers eating club officers sexual assault training; optional training was offered to upperclassmen this past year. While these efforts are commendable, they are small. We suggest that Princeton emulate large-scale sexual assault bystander intervention programs that have proven successful at peer institutions. A bystander intervention program piloted in Haverford College and since adopted by Dartmouth trains students to identify situations of potential sexual assault and teaches proper techniques to prevent such occurrences. Participating students are paid hourly to attend campus parties sober in order to observe and intervene in cases of potential sexual assault. The Editorial Board recommends that Princeton adapt such a program to the eating club system. While all eating clubs currently have at least one officer on call at each eating club function, we believe that the eating clubs, in coordination with the University, should institute a specific and separate bystander intervention program similar to the programs at Haverford and Dartmouth. Under such a program, each eating club would be responsible for having several members serving as an extra level of safety and security each Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. The participants in this program would undergo mandatory training in sexual assault prevention, and would be compensated for their work. This program would fill an important void. Club officers are often overburdened and cannot solely focus on sexual assault prevention. While SHARE peers and others who have attended SHARE trainings are equipped to intervene, they may not be present in every situation or solely focused on finding instances of potential sexual assault. Those being paid by the University would be both trained and remain sober and solely focused on intervention. Even if Nassau Hall acts on the recommended reforms, the University will be the last Ivy League school to move to lowering the burden of proof standard from “clear and persuasive” to “preponderance.” The University has once again been found playing catch-up to its peers. Instituting a large-scale University sponsored sexual assault bystander intervention program would represent the University taking the lead in the national battle to eliminate sexual assault from college campuses. More importantly, such a program would make clear that the University is taking a strong stance against sexual assault. This would hopefully serve to encourage students to report sexual assaults at higher rates and make Princeton a safer and stronger community. Dissent by Zach Horton ’15 Bystander intervention policies are commendable, and I endorse such preventative efforts. Lowering the burden of proof in disciplinary procedures, however, is rash and potentially unjust. The abundant frustration on this matter is understandable, but the “preponderance” evidentiary standard does not ensure a just outcome when the primary evidence is accuser testimony. In our detrimentally libertine culture, everything depends on that singular — and elusive — criterion of consent. It’s no secret that consent is notoriously difficult to discern from conflicting accuser/accused testimony. The preponderance standard does not make that any easier; it only advantages an accuser over the accused. In a case like the infamous 2006 Duke lacrosse case, the preponderance standard could likely result in false incrimination. Beside that potential for gross injustice, it is perplexing that under this novel standard, the accused could be guilty of a crime for purposes of University discipline but innocent in the eyes of legal authority. If the accused is in fact a sexual offender, he — or she — should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I strongly urge the faculty to vote to maintain the current “clear and persuasive” standard and to press for more preventative and remedial action in confronting the severe problem of sexual assault.

67166|~|Media coverage and Ferguson|~|   September 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|I am from Saint Louis, Miss. I was born there, and I spent most of my childhood and adolescence coming to terms with the mess of contradictions and issues that form the core of the city that I identify as home, while still trying to open my eyes to what makes this “flyover city” special. I am not from Ferguson specifically; I am from another suburb that helps compose the series of rings around Saint Louis’ largely rundown nucleus. I do not speak on behalf of the residents of Ferguson, for I can never truly know how the community must feel in the wake of the tragedy that was Michael Brown’s death. As a young woman from a neighborhood not 20 minutes away, however, I can only begin to list off all the parts of this summer that enraged and saddened me. One of the things that most makes my blood boil over is the way in which certain sectors of the media began to cover Michael Brown’s death and Ferguson’s response, and how this is indicative of the state of our media in general. That is not to say, as I have heard in coffee shops, restaurants and pharmacies all over the city, that everyone should just get out and let the situation resolve itself in peace. Saint Louis’ longstanding issues of inequality, segregation and racism are no secret and form the basis for many of its seemingly unrelated problems today, in a way that resonates with other cities across the nation. No, the media should not stop covering these unpalatable issues. The statistics about racial profiling and police brutality need to be published on the front cover of the country’s most influential newspapers. Pictures of militarized men and women in uniform confronting people exercising fundamental rights need to be seen. However, there are other details of the situation in Ferguson that should be covered as well, and the language used in and focus of future coverage need to shift. First off, Michael Brown’s death should be mourned regardless of whether or not that was him in the video of the shoplifting. He should be mourned regardless of whether or not he was planning on attending college the following Monday. He should be mourned regardless of whether or not he drank and smoked pot. He was an unarmed man who was shot and lost his life, and for this reason he should be mourned. No one deserves to be shot six times and left on the sidewalk for four hours. I have no doubt that he was a wonderful person from everything that his family and friends have said in the wake of this tragedy; I am simply saying that his parents should not have to testify as such to keep the media from calling their late son’s morality into question. I call upon the media to stop “bringing to light” evidence that Michael Brown was “no angel” — an expression used to describe him in a New York Times article published on Aug. 24. It doesn’t matter. It matters neither in this specific case, nor in any others. In a loosely related vein, I also call upon the media to stop its emphasis on the lootings and waves of teargas, and to reevaluate its priorities should a similar situation arise in the months and years to come. Yes, these are components of the constantly evolving situation, but there are so many other dimensions that you miss if you are only searching for the next Molotov cocktail. You fail to notice the volunteers flooding in daily from the wider Saint Louis community to help clean the streets and supply essential items to residents. You overlook the demographics of those committing the violence  — many of them are not from Ferguson itself. You neglect the core issues at hand that led to Michael Brown’s death, and you do not supply as much pressure on the power structure of the area to resolve what truly happened and supply some modicum of justice to all involved. Again, I don’t call upon the media to vanish, to leave Florissant Avenue altogether and ignore dominant issues of our society as a whole. I call upon the media to reflect upon how it paints individuals across class and race and to do better in the future. I call upon the media to focus on the larger picture, or at least the most important parts of a specific narrative, rather than succumbing to the temptation of providing sensationalist minute-by-minute analysis of violence. I don’t have all — or any, for that matter — of the answers, but I can offer this small suggestion for a future in which the entirety of our nation continues to navigate the issues that continue to plague it. I can and will offer my condolences to Michael Brown’s friends and family. May he rest in peace.|~|Kelly Hatfield is a sophomore from Medford, Mass. She can be reached at kellych@princeton.edu. 
67162|~|Seeking strangeness|~|   September 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|I was speaking with a kind and interesting trucker last week outside of Pittsburgh, Pa., and a man — a stranger to the both of us — approached my friends and warned them: “Do you know that woman there is actually a man? I’ve never seen anything like that before. There’s something to talk about in church.” I was initially repelled by what seemed like blatant transphobia. However, upon our return to the woods later, perhaps as my mind cleared, I questioned my own reaction to this remarkable woman. I was struck by how my own biases had damaged my interaction with this trucker. I didn’t know, nor would I have cared, that she might be transgender, but I had felt uncomfortable around her for an entirely different reason. I wasn’t being transphobic, but I was shying away from physical unattractiveness, from perceived poverty and, worse than any single characteristic, from strangeness. The trucker had only a few of her original teeth, sticking at odd angles. The lines on her face bore testament to her 60-odd years, and, oh, the tales she told! Frugal but ambitious in the early days of personal computers, she had gone dumpster-diving for parts to assemble her own. The power source alone was built from parts of four decrepit ones, and the entire assemblage was cooled by an oscillating fan and held up by a pizza box. Beyond that, we discussed the TV show “Rocket City Rednecks” and its importance to science education, the meningitis epidemic at Princeton and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, as well as Shakespeare. We also swapped stories on how we’d involuntarily ended up at Days Inn Somerset — her engine breaking during a long haul down Interstate 70 and us being evacuated from our nearby Outdoor Action trip due to a few cases of gastroenteritis. Despite her conversation and obvious lack of ill intent, my OA freshmen and I were constantly on edge, clearly trying to distance ourselves from her. There was no reason to be afraid — the hotel parking lot was well-trafficked, it was broad daylight and the front desk was 15 feet away — but the thought of rudely slinking away was clearly on everyone’s mind. The truck driver herself was hardly menacing — average build, clearly well past her peak physical fitness. Her appearance was vaguely off-putting, but no more so than the sight and smell of our unwashed OA bodies. Our reasons for shying away were manifold and, perhaps, justifiable. Too many trips to New York and downtown Denver, and ubiquitous images of people who are simultaneously homeless, crazy and ugly have perhaps led me to conflate the three attributes. Or maybe, after one too many stories of truck stop serial killers, we feared the trucker for being a trucker. The reason itself matters less than the fact that it has little basis in fact and could easily have prevented us from meeting and engaging with a fascinating person. I met a number of other fascinating strangers this summer. In a bus stop in South Bohemia in the Czech Republic, I spent an hour chatting with a Czech former maître d’ at a high-end restaurant near my Littleton, Colo., home, who had come to know a number of hockey players, including former Colorado Avalanche forward Milan Hejduk and New Jersey Devils right winger Jaromír Jágr during his time there. In Nuremberg, Germany, I stayed with a married couple of professional translators, Lawrence and Peggy, who opened their home to my friend and I — even though we were strangers — and invited us to an organic beer festival where Lawrence was playing with his band, Yellowbelly. I can safely say that I learned more in conversations about European culture and history with these and others like them than I did in nine weeks of scientific research and museum visits. Before OA this year, Rick Curtis ’79 confirmed to the OA leaders that, next fall, participating in OA or Community Action will be mandatory to nearly all freshmen. Even though these programs ensure that we begin our college lives outside the Orange Bubble, we must continue to break out during our time here. Aptly named breakout trips are a wonderful opportunity to do this, and I would love to see every student here participate in these. Due to demanding class schedules, many students are never afforded the opportunity to study abroad. Departments, especially science, technology, engineering and mathematics departments, should make room in their course plans for a semester abroad. The more Princeton students puncture the Orange Bubble, challenge their conceptions of normal lives and learn from situations they would have just as soon avoided, the better. Interactions with people who don’t conform to Princeton’s community and don’t lead the bland and safe lives we live here drive us to change the world. A more porous bubble makes for a graduating class more apt to change the world outside of it. Maybe the next Rocket City Rednecks or Mythbusters can come from an inspired Princeton student. Or maybe the next game-changing hardware coming out of Princeton will be built in a pizza box.|~|
66971|~|When Fidel Castro and Hannah Arendt met at Princeton|~|   September 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Rafael Rojas Princeton University’s archives guard a story that helps to build an understanding of the totalitarian drift of the Cuban Revolution and the convoluted reading that the West gave that Latin American and Caribbean phenomenon. In April 1959, Fidel Castro, the prime minister of the new Cuba, and his delegation took a detour from their itinerary — leaving Washington D.C. for New York — in their first visit to the United States, which had been organized by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. They went to spend a couple of days at Princeton. Castro’s visit to Princeton was aided by several scholars and institutions of the University: the historian Roland T. Ely ’46, a scholar of the Cuban economy who lived in Princeton; ambassador Paul D. Taylor ’60, then a student and the president of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, the organization that extended the invitation to the Cubans; and the Wilson School, whose program in American Civilization had scheduled a seminar for those same days of April 1959 titled “The United States and the Revolutionary Spirit.” Castro delivered the keynote speech on the evening of Monday, April 20, 1959. According to the notes that Taylor took at the event, the Cuban prime minister opened his remarks proposing that the scholars and students in attendance listen to him as a practical revolutionary, as someone who did not study but rather produced a revolution. In Castro’s words, the Cuban revolution had knocked down two myths of 20th century Latin American history: It had shown that a revolution was able to defeat a professional army that possessed modern weapons, and it had shown that it was possible to create a revolution when the people were not hungry. This second observation is interesting in light of the official story of the Cuban revolution that, for the last half-century, has insisted in presenting the island’s pre-1959 society as a victim to the triple calamity of hunger, misery and exploitation. Curiously, in April 1959, Castro told the Princeton students and faculty members that one of the particularities of his revolution was that it had triumphed in a Latin American nation with a relative degree of social welfare. The Cuban revolution, according to this young Castro, had been more a political and moral revolution against a corrupt dictatorship than a class-based uprising of poor against rich. For this reason, the revolution had been supported by “95 percent of the people,” generating “unanimity of opinion,” a phenomenon unheard of in Cuban history. This analysis allowed Fidel Castro to add to the debate on “The United States and the Revolutionary Spirit” among the historians, philosophers, sociologists and economists of Princeton. The central theme at this seminar, as well in a good part of the historical and philosophical thought in the United States during the Cold War, was the parallel between the American, French and Russian revolutions as opposing models of social change. According to Taylor’s notes at the conference, Castro argued that the Cuban revolution belonged more to the 1776 tradition than to 1789 or 1917 traditions because it did not encourage class warfare. Nor did the Cuban revolution propose a confrontation with the United States, given that it preserved its distance from communism and encouraged a defense of Cuba’s national interests, a defense that the U.S. government could tolerate because it was framed on its own tradition of self-determination. One of the professors who participated in the seminar and who, most likely, listened to Castro that evening, was the German philosopher Hannah Arendt. Just that year, the author of “The Origins of Totalitarianism” and “The Human Condition” had been hired by the University and had begun to research the history of the French and American revolutions. Arendt’s lecture at the seminar was the starting point of her 1963 book, “On Revolution.” In the acknowledgements section, Arendt explains that the idea for the book had started during the seminar on “The United States and the Revolutionary Spirit,” organized by the program in American Civilization at Princeton’s Wilson School. In her book, Arendt argues that the historical linkage of revolution and war — two phenomena that, in her judgement, were radically different — had distorted the basic objectives of the modern revolutionary tradition: liberty and happiness. The advantage that, in her understanding, the American Revolution of 1776 had over the French and Russian revolutions was that by confronting the “social question” of equality through constitutional rights, the American revolution had achieved those historical objectives. Jacobinism and Bolshevism, instead, had created a disconnect between justice and law — what Ferenc Feher would later conceptualize as “frozen revolution” — that promoted despotism and buried the moral legacy or the “lost treasure” of the revolution. But despite having written her book between 1959 and 1963 in New York, a city where the communist radicalization of the Cuban revolution was fiercely debated, Arendt did not make any allusions to Cuba or Fidel Castro. In fact, the philosopher refers to Latin America only once in her book and does so only to place the experience of revolution in the 20th-century third world more in the French tradition than in the tradition of Russia or North America. An argument could be made similar to Susan Buck-Morss’ in relation to the lack of references about the Haitian Revolution in Hegel’s “The Phenomenology of Spirit,” but it is most likely that such silence contains as much colonial prejudice as rejection to the idea of communist totalitarianism, even in a region so dominated and intervened by the Atlantic empires like the Caribbean. In other moments of her book, Arendt describes the single-party dictatorships and the bureaucratic regimes of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as new forms of tyranny. In 1963, that seemed to be the rational choice of the Cuban leaders, reason for which the words of Castro that evening in Princeton must have rang, four years later, as a complete fabrication. According to Castro, the difference between the Cuban revolution and the revolutions in France and Russia was that, in the latter, “a small group had taken power by force and had established a new form of terror,” while in his nation the totality of the people had mobilized because of their “hatred towards a dictatorship.” Rafael Rojas is a Cuban historian.

66988|~|The message behind grade deflation|~|   September 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|For many returning undergraduate Princeton students, the month of August was the harbinger of good news. That month, a University committee tasked with evaluating the necessity of the grade deflation policy concluded that it should be rescinded. In place for the past decade, the grade deflation policy has capped the number of A grades any department could give to less than 35 percent. There is a plethora of arguments against the policy: it is outdated and archaic; it gives B grades to A-quality work; it fuels competition and inhibits cooperation; it even convinces prospective students against choosing to matriculate to Princeton. When investigating the efficacy of grade deflation, the committee looked into many of these concerns, and in their report, they expressly investigated several of the aforementioned topics. In fact, the entire fourth segment of the report consisted of chapters covering “anxiety among students, competitiveness outside Princeton, admissions yield and impact on freshmen.” Yet it is also important to remain cognizant of the fact that grade deflation, despite the negative reputation it has earned over the years, was, indelibly, a part of Princeton’s culture. It was launched under wholly positive intentions — Princeton was to be the first in what would hopefully become a larger battle to curb the rampant grade inflation that was spreading across college campuses nationwide. Moreover, it was to hold our professors accountable, to ensure that free grades were not simply given to students who enrolled (not that this was the case to begin with). Even today, when speaking of our academics, grade deflation is commonly cited to validate the worth of a Princeton diploma. Unlike other schools that have a rather unenviable reputation of simply giving away A grades, Princeton graduates can say that their GPA means something. Compared to our sister institutions where the average grade can be as high as an A- (here’s to you, Yale), we can revel in our academic challenges. What’s more, other claims about grade deflation have minimal basis. Even though anxiety about the grade deflation policy may indeed give accepted students pause before deciding on a college, the statistics show that it has really done little, if anything, to actually deter them from either applying to or deciding upon Princeton. The number of applicants, as well as the number of students in each class has actually grown from year to year. In fact, the number of applications Princeton has received has “risen for seven consecutive years,” concluding with the Class of 2015’s applicant pool. Despite grade deflation’s positive aspects, I feel that I am in accord with most students when I say that the committee’s recommendation to do away with the grade deflation policy shows a progressive and forward-looking mindset. However, it is important that the administration and the student body recognize that, if the policy is indeed done away with, it must be for the right reasons. Since grade deflation’s inception, stricter standards have inextricably worked their way into the minds of students and faculty alike. But now, after 10 years, those standards are self-sustaining. Even without the threat of grade deflation in place, professors will still ensure that students get grades that are indicative of their level of effort and quality of work. The chances are high that Princeton’s academics will remain as rigorous as always, that the distribution of grades will remain similar to before, and that Princeton will be Princeton, as usual. In the end, even if grade deflation ceases to be a reflection of our current academic struggles and instead fades into the past as a relic of a bygone administration, we should remember it not as the monster it is so commonly labeled, but instead as a successful effort at spreading a message to Princeton students, faculty and the wider community as a whole — that we hold our students and professors accountable, and that we will continue to do so, policy or not.|~|Jason Choe is a sophomore from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

67034|~|Urgent|~|   September 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I’ll begin with the most ironic part of this article — that to remind myself to write it, I emailed myself with the title in the subject line. This title refers to a growing number of emails in my inbox, and in yours, which demand a reply as soon as absolutely possible. Mine range from the professional — quote requests or application deadlines — to the sarcastic funny photo or YouTube video. At a summer retreat with the Dalai Lama Fellows, I attended a workshop on “Email Management.” I thought I’d finally figure out the secret to email management because at times (maybe you’re with me) I’ve felt like I was drowning in them. Turns out, so did everyone else. We found ourselves complaining about this feeling of urgency being a privileged problem, relieved that we each recognized this in each other, celebrating how we had acknowledged ourselves as a community. Our emails feel urgent for legitimate reasons. We don’t want to miss out on something important: a preceptor sending an altered assignment or a last-minute rehearsal schedule change. The University’s productivity culture is both our strength and weakness — we try to achieve great things, but sometimes lose our balance while juggling. What I learned from the workshop was simple: the “secret” to managing emails (and everything else) was managing oneself. By acknowledging that I work better in the morning, I now carve out an hour or so to clear my inbox of anything important. I check it two or three more times, but have made it a goal to leave it for the rest of the day. In a recent New York Times opinion column, Clive Thompson argued that work email should be limited to business hours to both increase productivity and happiness. He cites examples of German companies having their employees set their email to “holiday mode,” which literally deletes emails one received during vacation. I do not believe this could be feasible at a school with finals after winter break nor do I think the University should hover over our happiness like that. However, we should ask ourselves: why do we feel the need to check our emails constantly? Are these emails truly urgent? Why do we like to place this urgency on others? Here are the habits I’ve noticed in myself: 1. Checking my email before I sleep 2. Checking my email while waiting for a friend 3. Checking my email while walking (and inevitably tripping) 4. Noticing the urge to check my email when I go to the bathroom 5. Thoughtlessly “refreshing” on my phone I’m an addict. And this has to stop. Some would call this insanity; my parents have joked it before. Like Van Gogh, we do not “suffer from insanity, but rather enjoy every minute of it.” Or do we? How should I be able to responsibly respond to an email while exhausted, in passing, or on the toilet? The real issue is not whether I’ll be able to construct a competent response, but why I have had trained myself to feel compelled to constantly check it. According to a study at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, 68 percent of college students across American campuses reported checking their email during class. I distinctly remember the first time I did; it was also the last. I immediately tried to recall what my professor had said and couldn’t and realized I was wasting precious time. Although checking emails in class, before sleeping, or while walking works for some people, we should question ourselves nonetheless. Every email I send before sleeping is one more minute the bright screen keeps me from solid sleep. Every email I send while waiting for a friend, is one less minute spent focusing on what that person might need. Every email I send while walking is one less moment I take to breathe and appreciate wherever I am. If something is truly urgent, I will call you and ask. In the smart phone age, it’s hard to tell when I have your full attention, or if you have mine. I understand that sometimes we wait for interview results, or news about a surgery or a Skype call from across the ocean. I pledge to not treat your time as mine, to not waste mine in the delusion that emails are that imperious and to not falsely force you into “urgency.”|~| Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

66743|~|Blaming women |~|   September 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|If the Internet were a physical form, the darkest and slimiest grottos would be home to Reddit. Reddit has compiled and contributed to the world some of the most heinous pictures and comments, including subcommunities called: beatingwomen, jailbait, and most recently TheFappening. Though all these groups have since been banned, all have done their fair share of damage. TheFappening was one of the internet forums that hosted the dozens of recently hacked celebrity nude photos. The celebrities ranged from Olympic athletes to Academy Award winners, but they all had one thing in common: They were women. That sentence is likely shocking to no one. Nude photo scandals have become associated with females. It’s the default assumption. What the hackers did was an awful invasion of privacy that I wouldn’t wish upon anyone, but the fact that women were targeted and men were markedly not is almost as offensive as the act itself. It’s unlikely that the hacker couldn’t access the nebulous iCloud accounts of a single male celebrity; rather, it’s as though he thought that only women’s privacies were open and subject to violation. That only women deserved to be embarrassed for the pleasure of people that they don’t know. The thing is, even though these women were the victims of hacking, they’re still being blamed for the events that happened. Critics are asking the celebrities how they could be so careless and stupid, even though the images were protected on personal phones. In 2007, Vanessa Hudgens was subject to a photo leak that resulted in lots of apologizing on her part. Disney released a statement describing it as “a lapse in judgment,” hoping that Hudgens “learned a valuable lesson.” The thing is, as an adult, Hudgens was fully entitled to do what she wanted in the privacy of her home. Blaming her for the photo leak would be tantamount to blaming the victims of a home burglary just because they kept valuables in the house at all. A parallel situation to this occurred more recently with “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody” star Dylan Sprouse’s leaked nudes. Reactions, however, were markedly different. Dylan acknowledged and joked about the problem, and both the media and fans were supportive. Headlines commended the actor for being gracious with his mistake and commented that this was damage control done right. Hardly anyone lamented the downfall of the Disney star, and no statements were released implying that Dylan was learning from regrettable actions. On top of that, headlines decried the “bitter ex-girlfriend” that leaked his photos, insisting that Sprouse was not to blame for the ordeal — though no such defense occurred for Hudgens’ photos. Largely, victim blaming seems to be a problem that women have to deal with. These leaked photos are a good example of this, but there’s an even darker side to this, wherein the consequences for women are even worse. In the case of rape, questions are asked regarding what a woman did or wore to bring it upon herself. A survey taken in India asked men whether they would marry a rape survivor and many — though not all — responded that they would not, even though the women were the victims. What’s worse is what happens when we look at how the rapists deal with the consequences of their actions: The rapist from the nationally publicized Steubenville, Ohio case was just reinstated to his high school football team a few weeks ago. It’s not terribly difficult to be more cognizant of victim blaming. It’s an easy thing to put an end to if, as a collective, we see the harmful double standard it presents. The tide across college campuses, including this one, is definitely changing, as I hear fewer and fewer instances of it. Hopefully, with enough momentum, changing trends can expand from the youth population to the population of the country as a whole.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a molecular biology major from Cresskill, N.J.

66747|~|A little bit of perspective|~|   September 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|This summer I was helping a rising senior in high school with her college applications. We talked about all sorts of things, from possible essay topics to where she wanted to apply early. Then, she asked me how my first year had been now that it was over. I replied, “Fine.” While that may also be the answer I give my parents when I want to avoid a discussion, she’s used to hearing me ramble on and on with most topics, so she pressed me a bit more. All of the ups and downs of freshman year came streaming back in a flash. My Outdoor Action trip over Rosh Hashanah, choosing classes for the first time, Lawnparties, working on my first theater production, midterms, etc. The thing is, it’s impossible to describe your freshman year in just a few words. Living away from home, having a roommate, determining how you are going to spend your days and nights are all significant milestones that college students experience. Some are bound to work out smoothly, while others less so. Similar to any other year, it’s bound to have its ups and downs, and that’s perfectly okay. Being a freshman has its own unique challenges and opportunities. Most students go into freshman year with extremely high expectations, and understandably so. You evidently have high expectations when almost every adult you know is constantly reminding you that “College is the best four years of your life” and that “You are so very fortunate to be going to Princeton.” The thing is, this hype can ultimately lead to disappointment when some of your actual experiences aren’t perfect. When you have such high expectations, you are more likely to feel discouraged at times. Don’t get me wrong, I fully expect all of you to have many amazing moments this year. You can definitely look forward to that. However, all the hype means that students naturally lose sight of reality at times. Everything cannot and will not be perfect all the time. The thing about nostalgia is that people tend to focus on the good when looking back. That’s why, when adults reminisce on their college years, they rarely mention the bumps along the way. Heck, I look back on my summer in Peru during high school when I had mononucleosis the entire time — but didn’t know it until the day I returned home — as if it were one of the best experiences of my life! It’s a good idea to keep in mind that this year, while different and amazing in many ways, is just another year of your life. Once you realize that, it’s easier to be okay with the fact that this year, like any other year, will have a few rough moments. Remembering this will allow you to keep those difficulties in perspective, so that you can enjoy the good times even more. A friend of mine here at Princeton was hit pretty hard when his first semester didn’t live up to his expectations of being perfect; it made it harder for him to appreciate and relish all the moments he had enjoyed. Going in, had he acknowledged that not everything would be ideal, perhaps taking these small hits would have been easier. Once I explained this all to my high school friend, I went on to tell her all the things that I had really enjoyed this past year and what she can look forward to, wherever she ends up. So yes, my first year was fine, perfectly fine, as will be freshman year for the great Class of 2018.|~|Marni Morse is a sophomore from Chevy Chase, Md. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu. 
66725|~|Providing affordable graduate housing |~|   September 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Joshua Wallace GS I am a new graduate student at the University. I read the 2014 Statement on Graduate Housing with great interest since the graduate and family housing situation has been very concerning to me. I agree that the Butler Apartments should be kept open as an affordable option. I was extremely upset when I found out the Butler Apartments were originally scheduled for demolition this summer, since it was the only truly affordable option for my wife, myself and our soon-to-arrive first child. For perspective, a two-bedroom apartment in Butler Apartments has a monthly rent plus estimated utility bill of $1,179, while a two-bedroom apartment at Lakeside Graduate Housing has a monthly rent of $1,546, utilities included. However, there is something the statement has missed which I feel is critical to students with families, something which the University itself has also missed, and thus I add this supplement. In particular, the only thing mentioned in the statement regarding student families is child care. For students like me who don’t plan on using or don’t need child care any changes made to the University’s child care policies will be of no effect. In my particular situation, my wife had decided to stay at home with our soon-to-arrive first child which will leave us relying solely on my graduate student stipend that, while generous, is inadequate as a single income for a family in the housing currently provided by the University. I wish to raise awareness of students in this position. The housing statement seems to make the assumption that all graduate students are either single (and can thus defray rent expenditures by finding roommates) or that students with families will have both parents working (since the only suggestion in the housing statement in regard students with families is to provide better daycare) and thus the proposed Butler-less rent rates will be affordable for all students. This assumption is inaccurate. In my situation, my wife prefers to stay at home to raise our child. In another situation, I quote from another new graduate student: “My husband will be out of a job when we arrive and interviewing for an unknown amount of time. Thus, we will be living on a single income for a period, and I’m concerned about how we will be able to make ends meet. One of the appealing aspects of attending Princeton University was the available family housing, however with Butler being demolished and Lakeside not yet available (not to mention the fact that it is much, much more expensive) I am frustrated with the remaining options.” For people like us, improving the child care situation at Princeton as outlined in the housing statement will provide little to no improvement in our overall housing situation. The current graduate housing situation at Princeton has failed to address an important segment of its populace: students with families who will only be operating off one income. Not addressing this issue will be a failure on the part of the University to address the full breadth of diversity in its student populace. Keeping the Butler Apartments open would be a great solution, but based on the age of the apartments it seems that they will need to be replaced soon anyway (indeed, I believe that is the rationale behind demolishing them). I propose that the Butler Apartments could be replaced in phases with similar, but reasonably updated, low-cost family housing. Replacing the Butler Apartments in phases will allow at least a part of them to still be available for rent while the new construction takes place. Perhaps a similar but cheaper location could be found further off-campus and the new low-cost family housing can be built there with a regular shuttle service established to keep campus accessible despite the increased distance (which also addresses concerns in the recent Statement on Graduate Housing). At least for me, value trumps extravagance when it comes to housing. I would love living at Lakeside but it comes at a very high (for me unaffordable) price. The Butler Apartments, on the other hand, find their value not in providing the nicest living environment for students but in providing affordable housing so that students can actually afford living in Princeton. Additionally, the creation of an alternative lower rent for single-income students with families would be beneficial. The family using such rent could help subsidize the lower rent by providing some sort of part-time alternative work (such as grounds work or office work at the apartments) to lower overall maintenance costs for the apartments. Each family with such an alternative cheaper rent could, for example, be responsible for five to 10 hours of office work or grounds work each week. This close-to-home part-time work would allow parents to still be able to watch their children near their home. As I look at the universities I’ve attended and those that I’ve visited and considered for graduate school, it is clear to me that while the University has made an effort to provide affordable student family housing, there is still a long way to go to provide the caliber of affordable family student housing available elsewhere (especially if the Butler Apartments are demolished). Based on the amount and affordability of family housing elsewhere, I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the lack of affordable family housing at the University may very well have deterred some students who otherwise would have chosen to attend Princeton. It almost did for me.|~|Joshua Wallace is an astrophysics Ph.D. student from Salt Lake City, Utah. He is a member of the Graduate Student Government. He can be reached at joshuajw@princeton.edu.

66651|~|Letter to the Editor: August 21, 2014|~|   August 21 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Daily Princetonian Staff|~|   Staff Writer     |~|To the editor, I’m glad that The Daily Princetonian has evinced an interest in the research the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies is doing — in fact, this work has a long history of connection to Princeton; Peter Lewis ’55, one of the university’s historically most generous donors and namesake of Lewis Library, was also a major donor to MAPS prior to his death last year. I am disappointed, however, that the emphasis of this article was oriented more toward reifying campus stereotypes rather than actually examining the research in question. MAPS’s studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy have been published in multiple peer-reviewed journals, and suggest a treatment approach to a widespread, debilitating, and often deadly condition (Posttraumatic stress disorder) that may be much more effective and well-tolerated than currently-available treatments. Psychedelic research is undergoing a renaissance at the moment: recent studies at Johns Hopkins and NYU are investigating the potential of psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety related to life-threatening illness, ongoing observational work is assessing the use of ibogaine as a treatment for opiate addiction, basic science research at Imperial College London is using psilocybin to examine functional connectivity between neural networks in the brain, and MAPS’s work with MDMA is being used in the treatment of PTSD and social anxiety in autistic adults. These substances are powerful tools for both healing and investigating the nature of consciousness — I’d encourage anyone who is intrigued by this work to take a closer look. Sincerely, Ben Shechet ’09 Clinical Research Associate, MAPS Editor’s response  The blog post in question was meant as a wink to the known use of recreational drugs within the premises of the Princeton Terrace Club. It was not meant to discuss any aspect of MAPS. However, the blog post correctly notes that MAPS is a nonprofit focused on research with psychedelic drugs and advocates for Food and Drug Administration approval of those treatments, information that was taken directly from public records filed with the Internal Revenue Service. As a biting post, it was published in The Prox, a blog within The Daily Princetonian whose tone is meant to be irreverent. Posts like these work under the premise that it is in the public interest to know how eating clubs work behind doors since they purposefully impose a veil of secrecy to protect themselves from scrutiny under university policies, law enforcement and the media. In our view, there is an overriding public interest when an institution has something to hide. “We at [Terrace] are a family, we protect each other, we don’t hurt the mother [sic],” Terrace president Christopher St. John ’15 wrote to the club the morning after the ‘Prince’ article was published. He then added in a second email to the membership: “In order for Terrace to survive we need to stick together. I hope we can all agree we want this place around for our 50th reunion, the chances of that are much lower if some of our membership chooses to create social discourse over tranquility.”|~|Marcelo Rochabrun Editor-in-Chief 
66341|~|An account of sexual assault at the P-Rade|~|   June 3 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|I saw what you did on Saturday at the P-Rade, and it repulsed me. I was walking with my classmates and our families down campus in the P-Rade, when you yelled “TEEEEE EYE” to get the attention of the young lady from the Class of 2014 who was walking with her parents near me. She, all of 20 years old, 5 feet tall and 100 lbs, had a Tiger Inn button on her beer jacket, and she was enjoying the beautiful day with her family and friends.  You, half a foot taller, bigger and a recent alumnus, raised your hand to give her a high five. However, as her hand was about to meet yours, you suddenly swung your arm down in a vicious roundhouse blow to land with a large smack on her butt. You thought that was funny! So witty! The poor young lady was startled and staggered away.  I was shocked, too, that you cared so little about her. A gentleman would never have pulled such a nasty stunt with a girl — only half his size! I guess the combination of your parents, TI and Princeton didn’t teach you how to be a gentleman. I can see that the national conversation about how to respond to incidences of sexual assault on college campuses is sorely needed. For my part, I was so shocked that I stepped over to the lady, now moving again with the P-Rade flow, and asked her, “Would you like me to knock that guy on his ass for you?” She refused and told me she was OK — it was only a guy from TI after all. She clearly didn’t want the attention that that would bring, and I dropped the matter. If you can read this and, like myself, are feeling bad about your behavior on Saturday, I encourage you to send a letter of apology to me; I’ll forward it to the young lady. However, I won’t expect one. After all, cowards like you who attack a young lady for their own amusement rarely do the right thing.  John M. Chludzinski ’85, Vice President, Class of 1985|~|
66109|~|The limitations of privacy|~|   May 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|It was a bright cold day in May, and the clocks were striking 14-and-a-half, as a crowd full of Princeton students, alumni, teachers and relatives filtered into McCosh 50 yesterday to hear the panel “Big Brother is Watching: Is Privacy a Thing of the Past or Can It Be Reclaimed?” moderated by Princeton professor Ed Felten. While the panelists almost unanimously agreed on the merits of privacy and the importance of retaining it, the concept of having too much privacy was not fully addressed. As the panelists suggested, privacy determines how we act. Regardless of what we do, there are always things that we prefer to remain private, even if they are not incriminating or scandalous. The fear that the government may know what we are doing or saying in the confines of our home can lead to a dangerous chilling effect, where our content, tone and language are censored for fear of being observed. Justice Louis Brandeis, considered the father of modern privacy jurisprudence, emphasized this in his dissent for Olmstead v. United States (1928), declaring “the right to be let alone” as “the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.” While Brandeis’ opinion failed to persuade the other justices to require the government to obtain a search warrant for wiretapping in the 1920s, his argument lived on, defining the legal atmosphere of privacy for the next several decades. Individual privacy is essential for any democracy. But we must be wary of reacting aggressively to threats to our privacy, especially in light of the recent Snowden revelations of the extent and scope of the NSA. Privacy, invaluable to any society, cannot blindly overrule our other rights and values. This is best demonstrated with the recent Court of Justice of the European Union ruling Google Spain v. AEPD and Mario Costeja Gonzalez (2014), which claimed that EU citizens had a “right to be forgotten.” According to the ruling, information considered “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive … in the light of the time that had elapsed” had to be removed on search engines like Google. Granted, at first glance this appears great. The ability to remove humiliating photos or false information may seem like a valuable asset, aiding victims of domestic abuse who may want to hide from their spouse and want to start a new life or celebrities victim to harsh and untrue rumors that quickly spread on social media sites like Twitter. However, this approach opens the door for misapplication, allowing users to censor data just because it is unflattering or uncomfortable, even if it’s true. While the ruling did claim that information about public figures and information of “preponderant interest” should remain accessible, the abstractness of these terms leaves it up to judges to arbitrarily try to decide whether an individual is “public” enough or whether information is important enough not to remove. This can only open a Pandora’s box of inconsistency, with judges ruling on the basis of bias or preference. To be fair, the United States is not one to boast about the status of its privacy law. Currently through intermediary protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, there is little incentive for United States online content providers to remove incriminating or scandalous information beyond the fear of being beat by a competitor who is more efficient in protecting user privacy. Yet sites like Facebook, with little competition (sorry Google+) have little to be concerned about. Out of the majority of cases handled in the federal circuits courts, only a few decisions like Barnes v. Yahoo! (9th circ. 2009) have ruled against online intermediaries and that only being in the case of an intermediary promising to remove the content and failing to do so later on. On the other hand, the European court’s decision creates an incentive for risk-adverse companies to remove information any time it receives a request. Removing the content is easier and safer than trying to deal with the legal fees and publicity that come with trying to challenge the “preponderant interest” standard. Both sides undoubtedly have their flaws. That being said, it is important to realize that neither has pure immunity — based on the idea of being able to say anything freely — nor pure privacy — based on the idea of having complete control over one’s information. Rather, policymakers need to balance the two to come to a compromise that protects citizens, removing false rumors, while at the same time not detrimentally hampering debate by censoring information just on the basis of it being unflattering or embarrassing. Addressing the fear of government overextension with the NSA must not rob the public of its right to know.|~|Ben Dinovelli is a Wilson School major from Mystic, Conn.

66119|~|Research and real life|~|   May 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Richard Daker|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|The Alumni-Faculty Forums are perhaps the most undervalued part of Reunions. These panel-led discussions capitalize on the wealth of backgrounds and bodies of knowledge that Princetonians bring to the table to discuss some of the most pressing and most intriguing issues we face today. I went to one such discussion,“Where will neuroscience take us?”,  a question that promises to be especially pertinent in the not-so-distant future. While the  discussion of emerging neuroimaging techniques was thought-provoking, what I found most important about the panel was its focus on the interplay between neuroscience research and applying the findings of that research: In short, on the interplay between researchers and practitioners. Neuroscientists represented half of the members of the panel, with cognitive neuroscientist and Princeton professor Jonathan Cohen as a moderator and neuroscience Ph.D. candidate Daniel O’Shea ’09 as a panelist. The other half of the panel, however, were not scientists: panelist Patrice McConnell Cromwell ’84 is part of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, an organization dedicated to serving disadvantaged children and families, and panelist S. Matthew Liao ’94 is a bioethicist from New York University. Though Cromwell and Liao repeatedly reminded the audience that they were not neuroscientists, both of them impressively demonstrated solid knowledge of the discipline and explained how the findings and possibilities of neuroscience could, should and do help to shape their own work. As a bioethicist, Liao’s line of work has a fairly direct link to neuroscience, but Cromwell’s connection to the science is less obvious: Because her work strives to improve the lives of those in poverty, understanding the effects of poverty on brain and cognitive development can help her to implement appropriate interventions to counteract some of the negative neurodevelopmental effects that poverty gives rise to. In her column “The relevance of pop culture to academia,” Sarah Schwartz pointed out that “academia is often insular.” We need to do more to link theory and practice, research and real life. Far too often, the findings of fields like neuroscience and psychology remain unknown and unapplied by the people who, like Cromwell, are in a position to use what science has found to improve lives. This is a problem, and the burden of working toward practical solutions should fall on either side of the theory/practice line. Just as practitioners and policymakers should do their part by making sure they remain cognizant of the findings in fields that are relevant to their work, researchers should always consider the practical implications of their research. They should strive to think of creative practical uses for their findings beyond just the obvious ones. It falls to everyone involved to make sure that we’re getting the most that we can out of the findings of experimental research.|~|Richard Daker is a psychology major from Evergreen Park, Ill.

66114|~|Beyond 'having it all'|~|   May 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Schwartz|~|   Opinion Editor     |~|Princeton tradition defines Reunions. And although female alums are excluded from some of Princeton’s older traditions, the women on campus this weekend have formed their own legacy over the last 40 years. Princeton women, especially older alums, are resilient trailblazers — women who entered and dominated traditionally male arenas, including this campus, despite structural sexism and discrimination. This is not only a narrative of success but also of challenge and conflict. And so, another Reunions tradition is the women’s panel. In various iterations over the years, female alums have used Reunions as a forum to examine gender discrimination, women’s academic and professional success and whether Princeton women should attempt to “have it all.” This year, faculty and students discussed women’s leadership at the University on a panel called “Leadership, Gender and Sexuality: What, When, Where, Why and How?” and several female alums and faculty discussed work-life balance after Princeton in the alumni-faculty forum “The ‘Invisible Syllabus:’ Should Princeton Women Do It All?” Though both of the panels provided insights into the challenges women face on campus and beyond, the leadership panel acknowledged the truth that the “Invisible Syllabus” panel avoided: sexism and discrimination are structural problems, and women (and men) need to agitate for structural change. The faculty, administrators and students on the leadership panel all advocated for this structural change. They suggested implementing administrator and faculty training in gendered leadership, orientation programs so that freshmen understand from day one that gender equality is a problem on campus and leadership options that allow all students to take on more and diverse leadership roles without feeling overcommitted and burnt out. The women at the “Invisible Syllabus” panel also acknowledged that many of the challenges women face in the workplace and in achieving a work-life balance have structural roots. But instead of proposing structural changes, many of the women discussed their personal coping mechanisms. One woman talked about the value of finding time for herself to relax and recharge during the day; another credited her support network of family and friends for making her success possible. Undoubtedly, it is important for women to engage in self-care and develop strong support networks when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. It’s also much easier for Princeton students and faculty to propose practical solutions to the problem of gender equality on this campus than it is for anyone to propose solutions for society at large; the world of corporate America is obviously bigger and messier than a university administration. But on a panel like “Invisible Syllabus,” in which many of the women acknowledged the societal barriers to women’s success, it is insufficient to center the conversation on self-care and support networks. Instead, we should center the conversation on activism and systemic change — both on campus and beyond. In the leadership panel, Amada Sandoval, director of the Women’s Center, said it’s not part of the Princeton culture for students to complain or aggressively agitate for change. We take care not to rock the boat. Instead, Associate Dean for Campus Life Tara Kinsey explained, Princeton students perform happiness and competence. Students are always “on,” she said. Princeton students, women included, do not lose this mentality when we graduate. It makes sense: This façade of effortless perfection is often one of the key components of success, both on campus and off. But removing this façade and publicizing the struggle can be the first step toward change. One of the women on the “Invisible Syllabus” panel guessed that all of the other women on the panel with her had encountered obstacles on their paths to success. “We have experienced pain; we have experienced frustration, loss, anguish,” she said. Although they disrupt our image of perfection, these challenges should be discussed frequently and publicly. Identifying the flaws in the system and how these flaws work against women allows women to express this pain, this frustration — and anger. Discussing challenges debunks the myth that women who can’t “do it all” aren’t trying hard enough, and it allows all women to mobilize for change around shared obstacles. Because change is imperative. But in order to truly address gender inequalities, we need changes in law that will better the lives of all women, not just Princeton women with our distinct set of advantages. Completely absent in most discussions about “having it all” are women who have no choice and must do it all — for example, women who work two jobs and don’t have the option of paying for childcare. When we discuss necessary changes in childcare, reproductive rights, equal pay, flexible working schedules and better benefits for part-time workers, we fail to make true change if we do not consider the needs of all women. We should not be asking whether we, as Princeton women, can have it all. Instead, we should ask ourselves how we can change society so that all women can have the life that they want.|~|Sarah Schwartz is a history major from Silver Spring, Md.

66091|~|The relevance of pop culture to academia |~|   May 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Sarah Schwartz|~|   Opinion Editor     |~|Between the raging and revelry, Reunions can also give former University students an opportunity to revisit their academics. Yesterday morning, American studies professors presented to alumni and Reunions attendees, several graduates from the Program in American Studies among them, on AMS 101: “America Then and Now.” When AMS 101 was first offered in Spring 2013 as a survey introductory course for the certificate program, the department was deliberately trying something new. The department wanted to offer what program director Hendrik Hartog called “big, broad survey courses,” courses, which, he said, are few and far between at Princeton today, due to an increased focus on academic specialization. At first glance, AMS 101 looks like a return of the traditional survey course. Its content spans centuries of American history, weaving concepts together with an interdisciplinary approach drawing from history, art history, politics, English and African-American studies. But even though the AMS department categorizes AMS 101 as a survey course, it’s really something much different — much richer and more thought provoking. A true survey course of American history and culture that attempted to cover the highlights in a comprehensive, chronological way would inevitably lack depth and nuance. Instead, AMS 101 is a survey of moments, of artifacts, in American history and culture. Its 2014 syllabus describes the course as an introduction to “a series of significant episodes and events in America’s past and present.” Each “episode” in the course speaks to broader themes about American life. Students study canonical texts like F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” but also episodes of the HBO series “Deadwood” and excerpts from Dr. Spock’s 1946 childcare manual, “Baby and Child Care.” With this format, AMS 101 defends the relevance of pop culture to academia. As Bennett McIntosh noted in a recent column, courses that find academic merit in popular media often face critiques for their perceived frivolousness. However, pop culture is a rich source for social analysis and historical inquiry. In studying Dr. Spock’s “Baby and Child Care,” students examine the invention of childhood, the idea of Republican motherhood, the commodification of childhood and the rise of medical authority. Students make connections between what Professor Rachael DeLue, a co-instructor of the course, called the “two Jays” — Jay Gatsby and Jay Z — in a conversation about Baz Luhrmann’s adaptation of “The Great Gatsby” and America’s second Gilded Age. Academia is often insular, with little attention paid to how popular culture can link concepts and help us interpret meaning. AMS 101 broadens the scope of academic inquiry, acknowledging the interplay between academia and society. Though the study of pop culture may not be appropriate for every discipline, University courses in other departments — history, politics and psychology for example — could benefit from more analysis of how the wider public experiences the ideas discussed in our classrooms.|~|Sarah Schwartz is a history major from Silver Spring, Md.

65451|~|Letter to the Editor: May 12, 2014|~|   May 12 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|We write to clarify statements in a recent Daily Princetonian article titled “U. modifies definitions of sexual assault.” The article reported on revisions to Rights, Rules, Responsibilities that were approved last week by the Council of the Princeton University Community. The article stated that certain kinds of sexual misconduct will henceforward “only” result in expulsion and that “suspension is no longer a possible punishment for serious sexual misconduct.” These statements are not correct.  The revised language makes it clear that the University takes all cases of sexual misconduct seriously. All such actions are regarded as serious offenses. The revised language does not change the fact that when a student is found responsible for sexual misconduct the full range of disciplinary penalties will continue to be available in each case based on its merits. But the revision does say that some cases, such as those involving force, duress, or inducement of incapacitation, or where the perpetrator has deliberately taken advantage of another person’s state of incapacitation, will be deemed especially egregious and may result in expulsion or termination of employment. The effect of this language is not to prescribe a particular penalty in any particular case, but to make it clear that students who commit these infractions are likely to receive very significant penalties.  The overall intention of the revised language is to clarify the definition of sexual misconduct and to convey to students and other community members that the University does not tolerate sexual misconduct of any kind.

65327|~|Wrongheadedness in Condoleezza Rice fight at Rutgers|~|   May 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|Last week, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice decided against speaking at Rutgers University’s commencement ceremony.  Though the Rutgers administration declared that it continues to stand by her invitation to speak, Rice declined so as to avoid “a distraction for the community at this very special time.” Why should such a distinguished political scientist and diplomat be concerned that her speech should be a distraction? Since the Rutgers Board of Governors had approved Rice as the speaker three months prior, students and faculty had protested the invitation and accompanying speaker’s fees and honorary degree vehemently. Claiming that her false statements on the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and her support of the resulting invasion made her a war criminal, the protesters demanded that the board withdraw her invitation. The student protesters’ tactics — occupation of a University senate meeting, forcing entry into the president’s office and picketing — were direct and disruptive to an extent to which this semester’s protests at Princeton opposing Richard Falk and by Praxis Axis, haven’t come close. The protesters were concerned that Rice would be speaking to a captive audience with no chance for dialogue, but I am unconvinced that Rutgers deciding against a commencement-stage political debate would result in its students being captivated by her war-criminal ways. Though the protestors may disagree with her political views, as I do, it is disingenuous to call her a war criminal absent conviction. The controversy is, in any event, quite beside the point of commencement. Rice, having given up her dream of being a concert pianist to become a successful black woman in a field still dominated by white men, presumably has much of interest to say on topics of greater relevance to graduating seniors, like how to keep achieving upon entering the real world and how to overcome obstacles on the road to success. Because a number of passionate students threatened to disrupt commencement, Rutgers students missed the opportunity to listen and to learn from Rice’s considerable experience. Speaking of opportunities to listen, the Rutgers administration’s response to the protesters fell flat. Mainly, by refusing to acknowledge the protesters’ legitimate concerns about Rice’s record, the administration encouraged continued escalation by protesters who felt their voices were not being heeded. It is not (and should not be) problematic to choose a controversial figure to speak at commencement proceedings — look no further than Ben Bernanke’s speech at last year’s Baccalaureate, or Al Gore’s speaking at Class Day next month — but student concerns should at least be acknowledged, and it is worth reconsidering the decision to endorse the entirety of Condoleezza Rice’s persona by awarding her an honorary degree. Indeed, the restructuring and lack of transparency in Rutgers’ Honorary Degree Committee — detailed by the Rutgers Daily Targum — is concerning to say the least. Commencement is, as Rice noted in her decision to step down, “a time of joyous celebration for the graduates and their families.” It is also, however, a culmination of four years of intellectual inquiry and broadening horizons. A peaceful protest of the politics of an otherwise remarkable speaker at commencement would be a fitting capstone to all of this. The protesting students, however, were not planning a peaceful protest. Provoked by the administration and their own adamant judgment on Rice, they threatened that commencement would be significantly interrupted, provoking Rice to step back. The protesters strongest concerns — that Rutgers was giving Condoleezza Rice a captive audience by giving her a platform to speak with no opportunity for response and that it was endorsing the entirety of her life’s work by granting her an honorary degree — could have been allayed without the university or the former secretary of state backing down from the invitation to speak. In the spirit of engaging debate, a panel discussion between Rice and others interested in American policy of the time — perhaps including Toby Jones, an associate professor of modern Middle Eastern history at Rutgers, who is writing a book titled “America’s Oil Wars” — before or after the ceremony, would allow dialogue without bringing undue confrontation into the ceremony itself. Arguments on both sides of the controversy have called it an issue of free speech — whether Rice’s free speech or that of the students was being suppressed. Note that since Rice withdrew of her own volition and the student protesters faced no legal consequences for their speech, even in regards to trespassing, neither party came close to having their First Amendment rights violated. This is instead a matter of academic freedom. All involved students, faculty and staff should be concerned in the utmost that student passion and administrative obstinacy resulted in the suppression of a number of valuable discussions within the Rutgers community.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a chemistry major from Littleton, Colo.

65341|~|Is Princeton a selfish endeavor?|~|   May 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|We often speak about the importance of thinking outside the Orange Bubble — what about popping it? Our four years at Princeton produce many memories: lunches with friends, late nights in Firestone Library, learning and growing from different extracurricular activities and sports. Our time here sometimes seems too long, but it’s simultaneously escaping us quickly. With finals quickly running away from us and summer quickly running toward, I find it important to reflect on why we are here running along the racetrack of undergraduate studies. I ask myself: Is Princeton a selfish endeavor? I am my own devil’s advocate because I am indeed an undergraduate here. However, it’s important to question why we are here and what we will do with the gift of a Princeton education. Four years is a long time to study; four years is a short time to make a difference. If we believe that a Princeton education is “in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations,” what do others expect of us, and what do we expect of ourselves after graduation? The financial crisis has certainly shifted what an undergraduate degree can mean. According to Career Services, in 2006, 50 percent of employed Princeton graduates were in the financial and insurance sector. In 2009, the number cut sharply in half to 25 percent. This is not to argue that those who pursue a career in finance are not contributing to the nation’s service in other ways. Of course, those who make money can (and do!) certainly give it away to charities — but what if our Princeton minds, rather than our checkbooks, were used to solve problems of unfair systems? The Scholars in the Nation’s Service Initiative program is an interesting Princeton-centric solution. According to the program website, “There is a critical need within the U.S. government for the most talented, dedicated young people to step forward to help tackle the increasingly complex challenges, domestic and international, that will face our nation.” The Thiel Fellowship is another solution. Eden Full ’15 took time away from Princeton to pursue and perfect her SunSaluter organization that “helps solar panels follow the sun, while providing clean water.” While The New York Times implied that Full was not returning to Princeton (although she did), her two years away allowed her the time and space to create something with potential for incredible good. Education is privilege. College is privilege. Princeton is privilege. I therefore contend that a Princeton education is selfish, at an undergraduate or graduate level, if we take this education and do not use it for others.|~|

65296|~|I am not my privilege |~|   May 11 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Writing this letter took a lot of courage, especially after seeing all of the ad hominem attacks and ridicule directed at Tal Fortgang ‘17 in response to his article in the Princeton Tory. However, the discussion on privilege and how we approach it is crucial, so here’s hoping that I won’t be attacked when I say I have a problem with the indiscriminate use of the phrase “check your privilege.” The phrase discourages discussions, leads to ad hominem attacks and dismisses arguments based on who the speaker is rather than what the speaker is saying. I have noticed a strange phenomenon throughout my time at Princeton. Whenever I discuss political issues, I am silenced with the phrase “check your privilege” when I disagree with aspects of activist views on redistribution of wealth, LGBTQ rights or feminism, solely because I am a straight male from an upper-middle class family. On the other hand, I am somehow entitled to contradict the same activists without nearly as much hostility — or scrutiny — on matters about immigration, racism or mental illness, presumably due to my firsthand experience and disadvantage in those areas as a neuroatypical, first generation Korean immigrant who didn’t speak a word of English at 10. In most of my discussions, the phrase “check your privilege” did more harm than good — I understand that it’s meant to ask people to evaluate their privilege and the effect it has on their views, but why is it said with so much hostility toward the person, and often paired with another commonly used phrase: “Shut up?” Is the anger at the presumed hypocrisy of the speakers, since they clearly don’t know what they’re talking about since they are white/neurotypical/straight? I know the point isn’t to attack me personally, but it is hard not to feel attacked when the implication is that I am uneducated about the topic because I am not marginalized. I am not denying the value of asking someone to evaluate their privilege. However, “check your privilege” is used too often to dismiss arguments and to start conversations directed at privileged groups, instead of facilitating conversations with privileged groups. It uses stereotyping, ignorance and shaming against one group as a weapon in a fight against stereotyping, ignorance and shaming against another. The end result is hostility, resentment and denial of privilege, with headlines like “ ‘I’ll never apologize for my white privilege’ guy is basically most of white America.” Yes, sadly, bigots exist. Yes, sadly, there are people who have no idea what privilege is, even when they benefit from it the most. And look, I get it. It’s annoying and obnoxious to have to explain the myriad ways in which privilege affords protection from harassment and prejudice to someone who has no idea what being black/ depressed/trans feels like, especially when it’s for the umpteenth time. But even if this is the case, we should assess opinions on their soundness and merit, not on the speaker’s sex, gender, wealth, education, race or neurotypicity. No argument should be declared illegitimate by virtue of the speaker’s privilege, and no one should have to defend themselves from ad hominem attacks in the meta-debate about whether their views are offensive that follows the accusation of privilege. As Jon Lovett wrote in “The Culture of Shut Up,” we should “win the argument; [not] declare the argument too offensive to be won.” If you are still unconvinced, think about all the layers of “privilege” lost when multiple oppressed groups disagree and throw the phrase at each other: Earlier this year, the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois decided not to show a documentary criticizing female genital mutilation and honor killings since it was deemed offensive to Muslims, whose accusations amounted to “check your non-Muslim privilege.” The phrase “check your privilege” creates a false dichotomy between the unprivileged-right and the privileged-wrong, when, in fact, discussions of privilege should provide us with better context for understanding each other. Does my privilege influence my views? Absolutely. Should I recognize that, understand them in context, try to educate myself and put myself in another’s shoes? Most certainly. Does being part of an oppressed group make your opinions more relevant in conversations about that oppression? Of course. But none of that gives you the right to shut someone up, label them a bigot and dismiss their opinions with a convenient three-word phrase. I, like everyone else, have a multitude of personas and identities. I am checking my privilege, but I am not my privilege. So please, look past my privilege, and try to listen to what I have to say.

65212|~|More than the one percent|~|   May 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Recently, Princeton has been the subject of bad press. Our most noted alumni include a First Lady who refuses to come to campus, a controversial senator who may have led a government shutdown and Susan Patton (whom I have no words to describe). To the media and general public, Princeton University is diseased — and not just by bacterial meningitis. Its students are plagued by rape, depression, misogyny, racism and privilege. I am not publishing an opinion on these matters. I am pointing out an undebatable problem on campus. Princeton students don’t vote. We love to talk about our political opinions in the press but don’t take advantage of rights we have for our voices to be heard. One percent of Princeton students voted in our district’s congressional primary elections in 2010. The share of college-aged students who voted in New Jersey’s last midterm elections was lower than the national average — 14 percent. When divided evenly, a little over one percent of all 18-to-24-year-olds were represented in each of the state’s 12 districts in 2010. The number of Princeton students who turned out in the presidential election year was slightly higher, but nothing to shout about. With such poor participation in local elections, one would hope that Princeton students are politically active in their home states. Statistics do not exist to show the percentage of Princetonians who voted absentee in the last midterm election. But it is hard to imagine that undergrads — who do not even vote online in USG elections — would take the time send in ballots by snail mail. National eligible youth voter turnout, 23 percent in 2010, supports this assumption of apathy. Low voter turnout is common on all campuses in the United States. But since when are Princeton Tigers the average bears? Don’t we pride ourselves on being the best college in the nation? Aren’t we supposedly top dog in the Ivy League? We are far from first in the Ivy League when ranked by political participation. Eight hundred Yale students, compared to an estimated 50 Princeton students, voted in their district’s 2010 congressional elections. That’s 15 percent of Yale’s undergraduate population. Even with smaller numbers — 14 percent at the University of Pennsylvania and 3 percent at Harvard — other Ivies topped Princeton’s undergraduate voter turnout. Now compare the Ivy League to the rest of the country. None of the top schools, including Princeton, are ranked as politically involved by The Princeton Review (ironically unaffiliated with our university). The George Washington University leads in activist students, with schools like Georgetown, American University, the University of Chicago and Vassar rallying behind. I am sure that each of you has left a class, precept or paper at Princeton without hope for politics. Your professor has finished a lecture with the phrase, “it all depends,” and conflicting theories have argued in your head until you have given up on seemingly unsolvable issues. (Engineers avoid these topics altogether.) But you know that we can solve major theoretical problems with small, practical solutions. The University falls into New Jersey’s 12th congressional district. If you follow politics — or watch Stephen Colbert — you may know that Rush Holt has been our congressman for the past eight terms. Rush Holt was a physicist and advocate of education and the environment (as well as a Libra and combatant of “sharknadoes,” according to Colbert). With Holt’s retirement, we will lose a smart and generally well-liked elected official in Washington. Princeton students have a responsibility to ourselves, our town and our nation to have a say in replacement representation. And our votes will matter. About 15,000 people vote in New Jersey’s 12th district primaries in non-presidential election years. Theoretically — and I know you love theorizing — if every student voted on June 3, Princeton undergrads could pick our own candidate to run in the November midterm elections. The influence we have over upcoming Princeton elections makes it important to identify politically with our current home — the one we will return to for Reunions revelries year after year. It is easy to register and vote by mail in this district using your Frist Campus Center address. You can make the switch for the entire time you live in Princeton, or for one election. As our yearly festivities and resumes show, Princeton will be a part of us forever. So, why not be a part of Princeton forever? Further, why not make Princeton a place that you are proud to identify with forever? It is time to silence what everyone is saying about Princetonians and make our voices heard. Let’s end the loud debate over our character by proving that we care about more than the words written on our resume and in the papers. Let’s show that we are committed to the improvement of our community and our country. A quiet commitment to Princeton and 10 minutes spent by each of us would make a powerful statement. Register to vote in the upcoming elections by May 13, and have your opinion heard with a ballot.|~|Morgan Nelson is a politics major from Key West, Florida.

65202|~|Be brave|~|   May 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|I wanted to remain in denial a little while longer, even though I knew this moment had been coming for quite some time. It is cliché to say that time has gone by really quickly, but it truly has. I’m about to embark on another chapter of my life and enter in a new stage of adulthood, but there is something that I have to do first before I leave. I’d like to give some advice to all opinion writers who are thinking about putting their work out there for the first time or are in the process of doing so. Publicizing your thoughts isn’t easy. But by doing so, you get to see just how thick-skinned and brave you really are or are destined to be. Although my journey as a writer has been through a lot of ups and downs, the process has made me a stronger person, and I wouldn’t change it for anything in the world. Growing pains are necessary when honing your craft, and there’s no other way to improve than enduring the process. I thank campus publications like The Daily Princetonian, The Stripes and The Nassau Literary Review for giving me the opportunity to share my voice with all of you. So without further ado, I will impart some knowledge that I’ve learned throughout the years. First: You’re going to offend someone. There is no way to get around it, especially if you talk about controversial issues like rape or hookup culture. The sooner you absorb this truth, the better your writing will become. If you focus too much on what other people think rather than pay attention to your voice, your words will suffer. Now, that’s not to say you should be careless and not take into consideration the many different angles in which your words may be interpreted, but acknowledge the fact that you cannot please everyone. Then again, your objective is never to please the readers, but to make your voice known. Any opinion is problematic. Our views are shaped by our background and experiences, and sometimes there are those out there who believe that your opinion is a personal attack on their lives. And at times, a single word or phrase can turn an otherwise harmless idea into a polemical one. Intent does not always match result. The best thing you can do is read each word carefully, consider the opposing side and use your best judgment to decide how to construct your argument accordingly. You’ll be damned if you do and damned if you don’t, so you might as well write what you think. Second: Have your arsenal ready. Your weaponry is your evidence. Whenever you make a claim, you have to be ready and able to substantiate it with facts, statistics and anecdotes. This point may sound like a no-brainer, but it is very easy to create an argument based on passion alone, when reason and logic need to support it. You cannot craft an argument using only your emotions. Anything that would not hold up in regular discourse will not hold up in a column. A strong argument necessitates critical thinking. Do your research. Third: Most importantly — be brave. Be very brave even when you are afraid — and this goes especially for my minority writers. You will be subjected to vitriol and ad hominem attacks for your race, gender or sexuality. But don’t let these things stop you. Do not pay attention to those who attack you rather than your argument. Most times they should be ignored anyway. The things you’re most afraid of speaking up about are the things that deserve to be released out into the world. Have confidence in the fact that whatever you have to say is important. Take the sign of “cold feet” as proof that what you feel matters. Vulnerability is not synonymous with weakness. Open yourself to the questions that bother you most and explore them to their depths. Honesty is the best characteristic of an op-ed. Remember: there will always be someone out there who agrees with you. And you never know, you may have been the voice to all the sentiments they have felt but never had the courage to say out loud. You never know how much impact you will have on another person’s life. Besides, it feels much better to get things out of your system rather than to hold them in. Trust that your passions are there for a reason. Don’t stifle them. You know yourself better than you think. Seek the help from other writers or friends who can guide your thoughts. Never be afraid to admit that you’ll mess up. Mistakes will happen. Accept them as part of your trajectory and necessary for your evolution as an artist. Good luck out there. You will be fine — trust me.|~|Morgan Jerkins is a comparative literature major from Williamstown, N.J. She can be reached at mjerkins@princeton.edu. 
65178|~|Letter to the Editor: Why men should talk about sexual assault|~|   May 8 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Given the recent columns in The Daily Princetonian, “Rape Culture exists here, too” and “Speaking Up,” it is evident that sexual assault is a problem on campus. Some may disagree over the scale of the problem, but regardless of one’s views on drinking or hooking up, we can all agree that there are far too many instances of sexual assault at the University and across the country. The University administration has tried to combat the problem by instituting harsh punishments and establishing a number of health services related to sexual assault prevention. Though organizations such as Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education offer great resources, the problem has not gone away. To effectively combat sexual assault, change has to come from within the student body. Cultural change does not come easily and will not happen overnight. However, difficulty is not an excuse for inaction. Speaking from the perspective of a male varsity athlete and member of a Bicker club, I contend that men need to have an honest conversation about what we can do to combat sexual assault. The logical place for this conversation to start is within fraternities, athletic teams, performing arts groups and eating clubs. These conversations will be awkward at first. We, as men, need to think about how women will feel after a hookup, especially when there’s alcohol involved. In the heat of the moment, do we really ask ourselves whether the woman is going to feel sad, hurt or violated? It’s hard to entertain these thoughts when the beer and testosterone are running high. But if we talk about it in quieter times, we can help each other think twice later on during a night out.  This dialogue will open up a larger conversation about why we value certain ideals of masculinity that directly or indirectly contribute to sexual assault. Perhaps it’s actually far less masculine to “get your numbers up” than it is to make sure women aren’t taken advantage of. Perhaps it’s far less masculine to try to “slay girls” than to realize that women who are victims of assault are current and future friends, sisters and mothers. The terms “numbers” and “slaying” are often used in a joking manner. However, this kind of language, even as jokes, undoubtedly affects and shapes how men perceive what masculinity means. Though these notions may not directly cause sexual assault, they definitely are not helping fix the problem. I realize that I do not have all the answers in combating sexual assault. However, what I do know for sure is that this dialogue needs to take place, regardless of our opinions. One of the things that make sexual assault such an insidious problem is that these topics are never talked about. Starting these conversations will be uncomfortable. However, if we take a step back, we’ll realize that the potential ridicule by our friends pales in comparison to the deep hurt that the victims of sexual assault experience. I am very optimistic that we can make a difference at Princeton. Even in the process of writing this column, I have had the chance to speak with fellow teammates and club members about this issue and have only been encouraged by where our conversations have gone. Let’s talk, men. Kevin Zhang ’15|~|
65121|~|In response to Tal Fortgang|~|   May 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Dear Tal Fortgang and the Princeton University Community: Welcome to the fun house world of American mainstream media’s obsession with caricatured versions of campus identity politics. In this world, the small groups of genuinely left-wing or minority students who are outspoken in their criticism of society on campus are seen as some sort of thought police who stifle open debate in that critical agora of the mind, the academy. You are the latest in a sequence of young white males (and one Asian of Indian descent, among the stars of this long-running drama) selected as the hero-martyr of a discourse that began in the 1960s. If you don’t relish the idea of being a kind of Ivy League political and moral Pepto-Bismol for the middling, middle-brow and comfortable for the remainder of your life — well, then, I have a suggestion: study history, not politics. American history, ideally. The reason for this is simple.  You wrote in your essay about your grandparents: “It was their privilege to come to a country that grants equal protection under the law to its citizens, that cares not about religion or race, but the content of your character .” I find this quotation fascinating. You seem to genuinely believe that the United States in the 1940s was a country that granted equal protection to its citizens. And cared neither about religion nor race. It may come as a shock to you to learn that far from “caring not about religion nor race,” the United States in the 1940s was a country in which it was assumed that not just a white male, but only a white male Protestant could become President (the catastrophe of Al Smith’s 1928 campaign was still a fresh memory then). It was a country in which it was perfectly legal to write into the deed for one’s home, or an entire new subdivision of homes, an enforceable legal covenant that said “No Jews.”  Or Blacks, or “Orientals,” perhaps here and there even “no Catholics.” The United States was a country in which Catskills resorts like Grossinger’s flourished in part because older, more prestigious resorts like Mohonk Mountain House simply didn’t allow Jews, much less people of color, to come stay. A country in which most stores on 125th Street in Harlem didn’t allow “coloreds” to patronize those stores, adjacent to the largest and most prestigious African-American neighborhood in the country. Your grandparents gratefully came to a country that wanted to believe itself a shining beacon to the world and the fulfillment of the prophecy built into our founding documents of a near-utopian society without injustice. There is nothing wrong indeed in being inspired by these 18th-century ideals and their application today. But the reason your grandparents were able to come here at all is the then-tremendous guilt about America’s indifference to the persecution of Jews in Europe before and during the Holocaust. It was the vindication of New Deal liberal interventionists after 1945 that made possible new laws on refugees, laws that were written to conform American law to codes developed by the newly founded United Nations and its promise of morality over national self-interest. That made an exception to highly racist, quite extreme limits on U.S. immigration legislated in the 1920s that were designed to keep Jewish (and Catholic, and southern European) immigrants from coming here. Perhaps it is now time for you to open your eyes to all the history that explains the argument you find yourself naively inserted into now, ingenuously pure in your belief in an America that might exist one day, but that exists now (and I write this more admiringly than critically) almost wholly in your imagination. Bring that imagination into contact with reality, and perhaps you can make that dream a bit more real. But please don’t help along those who would lie to us and themselves and say this has been the American reality all along, telling us to shut up and accept that we already live in a “best of all possible worlds.” We don’t.|~|Michael D.

65146|~|Editorial: Increasing female leadership on the Street|~|   May 8 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|A recent piece published in Nassau Weekly detailed the lack of female officers in the eating clubs. Though the definition of an “officer” varies from club to club, most clubs have a president, vice president, social chair, house manager and treasurer. Less than one third of these positions are currently held by women. Of the 11 eating clubs, only Colonial has a female president, Nassau Weekly reported. The consequences of gender discrepancies in eating club leadership have serious implications. The imbalance reinforces the current male-dominated culture on the Street, a culture that tolerates overtly sexist event themes, such as “Yoga Hoes and Workout Bros” and “Jedis and Sluts,” and situations that can result in sexual harassment. Some female officers interviewed for the Nassau Weekly piece stressed that they prioritize making the clubs safer spaces for women. This is especially critical in light of the disturbing rates of sexual assault on the Street. Tiger Inn, for example, after being sued in 2008 by an alumna who was sexually assaulted during pickups in 2006, established an appointed position referred to  as “safety czar.” This position is almost always held by a female member — typically the only female in the officer core. Female officers are also important in helping to moderate or prevent overtly sexist events that can occur at Bicker, pickups and parties. One of the most important officer responsibilities is to mitigate the risk of injury, assault or harm to guests and members. An all-male officer corps is not necessarily adept at or concerned with identifying threatening behavior, or representing the interests of all members and guests, particularly females. Among many factors contributing to the gender discrepancy, women suggest in the article that fraternity membership gives men an advantage in campaigning for officer positions. Fraternities are smaller and more close-knit than sororities, making them a better base of support. Further disadvantaging women, many clubs adhere to a traditional unspoken quota which allows only for certain, often lower-ranking, positions to be held by women. Furthermore, there are double standards for women in clubs. Women are often discounted when they express interest in running, while men are almost always looked upon favorably for seeking leadership roles. The Board believes that clubs have an interest and an imperative to encourage more women to run for officer positions. When the Steering Committee on Undergraduate Women’s Leadership investigated the lack of campus leadership positions held by women, it found stunning gender distortions. One of the report’s suggestions was to implement direct mentorship programs and female-directed leadership encouragement to help reduce this gender discrepancy. The Board suggests that the clubs informally adopt such a mentorship program and that the outgoing officer corps and the graduate boards actively encourage women leaders to run for high officer positions. The Interclub Council and alumni boards should also lead by example by adding more women to their own ranks. In addition, the ICC should more readily publish gender statistics about members and officers. This inequality could more directly be mitigated by a system that allows for the officer core to appoint particular positions in their succeeding officer core. Another potential solution is for clubs to institute electoral rules that ensure a degree of gender parity. For example, a gender rotating system, where each year, the officer must alternate to another gender or where in a given year the gender of each positions is rotated (i.e., if the president is male, the vice president is female, etc.). Clubs might also look to nations like Argentina, South Africa and Norway and companies across Europe that use quota systems that ensure female representation. Each club should canvass these and other tried tactics to determine how, given its unique context, it might take meaningful action to close the leadership gender gap. Dissent  The object of this Editorial is admirable. We entirely agree that it would be wise to increase women leadership on the Street in order to attend more readily to the needs of all club members and guests, particularly with regards to safety and prevention of sexist-themed events. Our sole complaint with the majority lies in its suggestion of a quota system. Quotas would likely be counterproductive in that they tend to stigmatize female officers, do not necessarily ensure that the most qualified person for a given position is elected and ultimately fail to get at the root of the problem. On this ground alone, we dissent. Signed by Zach Horton ’15, Eve Levin ’14 and Sergio Leos ’17. Mitchell Johnston ’15 is recused due to his current position as an eating club officer.|~|
65149|~|Princeton is so much more than schooling|~|   May 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|I sat to write this column, my final in this paper, and drew blank after blank. There is simultaneously so much to say about my time at the University and no good way of saying it. We run out of time; we all must leave. This thought, not a purely sad one, created in me a sense of nostalgia. I was tempted to convey these melancholy sentiments here and then felt gross. My final column was not going to resemble a fifth grader’s farewell address to elementary school as his first traces of pubescent emotion settle in. So desperate for inspiration, I asked my friends advice as to what I should write about. The first piece of advice I got was to compose for twenty uninterrupted minutes a list of my most memorable experiences. Most of them had to do with some form of mischief, drugs or sex. Although I do believe rules are meant to be broken, tastefully, I figured my parting words should not advocate breaking the rules. Limits are meant to be pushed, and the sanctity of doors that say “don’t enter” ought to be breached from time to time. My list did shed light on the fact that my time at Princeton has been about so much more than schooling. Princeton is very much about experiences outside the classroom, adventures that we have to create for ourselves. This thought is not new, and in turn I did not want this to be the subject of my final piece. So I thought about providing other pieces of advice to future Princetonians. I would let them know classes are important, our professors are amazing and our peers are our most important resources. Again, gross. These thoughts are not unique, and so the advice is not helpful. Maybe I ought to write not about my time at Princeton, but what it means for that time to be ending. After all, only a senior has insight into the road’s end. So if Princeton is not just about schooling, what does it mean for it to end? It is clearly not about fulfilling credits and being handed a paper recognizing that completion. When Princeton ends, what begins? What is graduation? To walk out FitzRandolph Gate 24 hours before commencement would not deprive me of my distinction as a Bachelor of the Arts. There has to be significance to the robes, the scepters, the marching and the Latin. Graduation, I suppose is a ritualized transition ceremony that makes something mundane quite profound. We are not just done with credits; we are entering a new phase. At this point in my musings I discovered I didn’t have much to say about Princeton ending. So, I thought, perhaps this article should be about that which lies beyond the Orange Bubble. I took a job a couple of days ago; would folks like to know how that feels, to be an employed adult? What do I know about adulthood? I thought about the substance of my newfound maturity; it seems to be about shifting from consumer to a producer. All my life I have consumed people’s time, money and efforts. Graduation seems to usher in a time where I am responsible for myself and for contributing to the productivity of the world. This is a nice idea, but I could have done this all while I was at Princeton. I could have worked, produced and have taken more responsibility. So what changed? I am now forced to do normal things I had simply not done because I didn’t have to? So perhaps my insight into adulthood isn’t that profound either. This article then captures the fact that there is so much to talk about, but so too there is not much left unsaid. It feels as though something momentous and life-changing is happening during graduation, but perhaps it’s really a supremely common experience. Perhaps it is appropriate then, instead of waxing philosophical to spend my time thanking those who have stuck with me these four years. I don’t know who all of my readers are, but I am grateful to them, and in some perverse way even love them. And if you haven’t stuck with me these four years I still thank you for bearing with me for these 800 words. Random musings can be hard to get through. Thank you to my various editors who gave great insight and put up with my often last-minute submissions. Thank you to the friends and family who constantly and consistently helped me come up with column ideas. I could not have done this without their support. I will miss this place and the people in it. I guess it is tough to articulate that, but not everything needs to be said out loud. Goodbye readers. Goodbye Princeton (Ha! As if that were possible with yearly reunions). Goodbye 17 years of schooling. With an eye toward the future: I wish The Daily Princetonian’s opinion section nothing but the best!|~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif.

65002|~|Rape by any other name is still rape|~|   May 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|“Rapists are here! Stop protecting them!” There were a lot of words written on The Surface, an interactive art project for class VIS 439: Art as Interaction where students could write anything on four panels over the past few weeks, but few phrases lasted very long before the next person came along and painted over them. Not so for this quotation, however. From the time it was written, some time in the first week or so, no one dared to write over it. No matter what one’s opinion of The Surface may be, there is no denying that this quote made a profound impact on those who saw it, which is probably why it remained untouched for so long. One might ask why those six words were so poignant. After all, don’t we all know that the college rape culture is a major problem? There has been extensive news and opinions coverage in just the past month, from a personal account about the rape culture at Princeton to the recent announcement that Princeton is one of 55 universities being investigated as to whether its sexual assault policies violate Title IX. Perhaps students just understand that this is an extremely important issue and, therefore, deserves to remain seen. But there were other important issues brought to light on the board too. Yet those eventually were painted over. So what makes these two sentences special? I think that despite this being common knowledge in the back of nearly everyone’s mind, it was shocking to see the words so starkly written out in caps and red ink. Because normally, we don’t call out these occurrences for what they really are: rape. Princeton’s policy is a prime example of how people usually shy away from describing rape as rape. In “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities, the policy against rape is called “non-consensual sexual penetration.” Then it states in parentheses that the act is “commonly referred to as rape.” Around 15 years ago, Brett Sokolow, president and CEO of the consulting and law firm the National Center for Higher Education Risk Management, popularized the term “non-consensual sex” among universities because it avoids the stigma of the word “rape.” According to Sokolow in an article, he said that while colleges knew rape was happening, they didn’t want to label students as rapists. He thought that perhaps using a different term would “encourage schools to punish rapists.” After all, Sokolow explains that colleges can’t punish anyone for rape under the law since it is a criminal offense; perhaps using a term that differs from the legal crime might mean they could more safely punish perpetrators while in the scope of their jurisdiction. Perhaps colleges avoid the term “rape” for more legitimate rationales than being worried about their images and reputations. After all, part of the problem in obtaining criminal convictions in many college rape cases, including the recent one at Dartmouth, is that juries may consider some of these cases to be “gray rape,” because they involve alcohol and terms of consent that aren’t clear. I do not believe that “gray rape” is a legitimate reason not to convict someone of rape. I am a strong believer of the phrase “only ‘yes’ means yes.” Nevertheless, admittedly the confusion that alcohol adds to a situation renders it difficult for a prosecutor to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt. Many Dartmouth students found the acquittal in its recent case disappointing. Since, unfortunately, the greater society and our laws have not accepted a stricter and more accurate notion of consent, many victims are not inclined to pursue a criminal investigation. Therefore, perhaps using terminology such as “non-consensual sex” would allow colleges to punish offenders. Theoretically, even if these perpetrators can’t be convicted under our outdated criminal system, there could still be some repercussions from the college. But this isn’t what is happening. The Title IX investigations, including one at Harvard — probably based partially on the viral “Dear Harvard, You Win” letter — prove this. As do the recent recommendations from the White House Task Force on sexual assaults on campuses. Rather, by not calling these assaults rape, universities are under less pressure to take punitive action. After all, to an oblivious public it doesn’t seem as bad not to punish “non-consensual sex” as opposed to not punishing a student for raping another student. According to Washington Post columnist Petula Dvorak, rebranding rape is only making accountability harder. After all, rape is a felony. It wouldn’t look so great were a school not to punish someone for committing a felony, even though that is exactly what is happening. The fact that people wince at the word “rape” is exactly why using the term is important. It’s violent and powerful and does justice to the crime itself. “Non-consensual sex” is a euphemism that waters down the crime and is perhaps contributing, or at least not stopping, the rape culture. Perhaps the only way to accomplish real changes to the rape culture is to call it out for what it is.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Chevy Chase, Md. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu.  
64995|~|Minding your manners|~|   May 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|It’s surprisingly easy not to be a jerk. All it takes is a shred of self-consciousness and a degree of shame and humility. And yet, all too often (especially during celebratory periods), etiquette is disregarded and put aside while morals degenerate. Case in point — the recent Lawnparties. Naturally, following the end of second semester classes and the imminent end of the school year, students want to kick back and have fun. While such a mentality is certainly acceptable, it in no way condones the types of detrimental behavior that often arise in such situations. For instance, while walking back from the Street after Lawnparties festivities, a group of students for some reason felt compelled to see how well they could shatter a champagne bottle. Besides the obvious safety hazards (flying glass + short pants = a formula for disaster), it was also just a thoroughly rude action. Of course, these students didn’t even bother trying to clean up after themselves; rather, they just laughed and walked away, leaving a pile of fragmentary shards lying in the middle of a road for the next passing car. They ignored the students who could very well have been harmed by the broken glass. And they even shamelessly strolled by a group of shocked tourists who had happened to witness the event. Lawnparties itself was no different — upon hearing that the Nomad Pizza Company truck might be running out of dough, several students unabashedly sidled up to the front of the line to stand with their accomplices, completely brushing off the infuriated students they had just cut. Scuffles broke out as some students tried to get as close to the stage as possible by pushing others out of the way. And countless partygoers dumped their solo cups on the ground because it would apparently have been too much effort to walk 10 feet to the nearest trash can. Alcohol may likely have factored into the problem — after all, inebriation often encourages irresponsible and reckless conduct. But the question of whether intoxication may have caused the aforementioned behaviors is not the point — rather, the point is that, at events such as Lawnparties, it is all too easy for some students to forget (or at least to forgo) basic responsibility for their actions. In turn, when such students act in dangerous, detrimental or derogatory ways, they reflect poorly on the University community as a whole. They send a message that they are at once isolated from and immune to basic rules of social behavior at these special events, that participating in these celebrations renders them beholden to no standard of proper conduct. During Lawnparties, especially, when there was a higher confluence of visitors on campus also enjoying the festivities, negative behavior presents an inaccurately negative portrait of Princeton to tourists and outsiders. All of this is not to say that celebrations like Lawnparties need not be fun events; however, there are ways to have fun that don’t involve jerk-like behavior. A first step would be for the students who act inappropriately to realize that their behavior reflects on the school as a whole and that while they are free to have a good time, it is also important to remain cognizant of the fact that they are perpetually contributing to the collective image of Princeton. A detrimental action on the part of a single individual (or a single group of individuals) can do much to tarnish our overall reputability. Further, downplaying the perception of lawnparties as the “last” time to have fun before reading period and finals week would likely help — after all, a carpe diem mentality is ostensibly what drove these students to act so foolishly, and I doubt they would have acted similarly during a random school day. For most students, this is hardly the “last” time they’ll be able to have fun — there are plenty of events over reading week, and once summer begins, too, there will be plenty more opportunities to relax without schoolwork looming over their heads. Such a mentality is no excuse for dumb behavior. Ultimately, it is great to unwind and let loose, but having a fun time should not come at the expense of manners.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

64968|~|Speaking up|~|   May 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Anonymous|~|None|~|Editor’s note: The author of this column was granted anonymity due to the intensely personal nature of the events described. Preface: The brave columnist who wrote on April 30 inspired me to be courageous. This too will focus on a female experience, which is not to imply that sexual assault does not affect men. I am a woman, and I am speaking from my own encounter with the devils of violation. When I was assaulted, I was wearing a T-shirt and jeans. I was not drunk. He was. It was his birthday. He started to walk me home and offered to get me water from his room. I accepted the water; I did not accept how he forced himself upon me minutes later. I told him I was leaving. He grabbed my hair. I said, “No,” and I said it loudly. He pushed me aside, closed the door and breathed, “No. You’re staying.” Having advocated for women’s rights and taken self-defense classes since high school, I had always believed I would recognize the signs of someone who would attack. (I thought) I knew what to expect and (I thought) I knew how to avoid it and (I thought) I knew how to escape and (I thought) I knew how to take action and (I thought) I knew how to speak up. I told no one. I left my shoes outside his building and ran straight back to my room. I carried a pocket knife on my way to the bathroom, fearful some other shark would smell the scent of “victim” on me and strike again. I told no one. I felt scared of going to the eating club where we’d met. I felt scared to walk home alone at night. Most of all, I felt scared that saying the words “sexual assault” out loud would change me or shape me or break me. So I stayed silent. Every 22 minutes, a woman is raped in India. After the Delhi gang rape, Indian women and men took to the streets in vehement protest against this horrific, hourly violence. Every fourth college woman is raped in the United States. After every rape at Princeton, we return to the Street with words of different, sickening protest: “They were both drunk, so it’s unclear,” or “She can’t just wake up the next day and decide it was rape.” No wonder we keep our mouths shut — our cries are overpowered by both the loud music and the silence. After realizing that living my nights inside recurring dreams and riding the on-call TigerTransit bus (instead of walking) was not how I wanted to spend my years at the University, I reached out to a friend who is a Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education peer. She was incredible. Sharing my story changed me — it made that friendship deeper. Sharing my story shaped me — it made my voice louder. Sharing my story broke me — I needed to relive the pain in order to rid myself of it. Talking was both the tunnel and the light at the end of it. I urge you, if it has happened to you, to seek out these extraordinary individuals who will help you. Speaking up is standing up. Speaking up is the first, best hope we have to creating a culture on campus that does not accept too-easy notions that sexual assault does not happen here or that any type of physical or mental harassment is OK. To those of you ready with your words, like knives, to think or comment in an offensive way — think of your mothers. Your sisters. Your friends. Read closely. Sexual assault is real. It is the nightmare from which you wish to wake up then fall back asleep in order to dream of something different. Rape culture is real. It is the path we walk, to and from the Street, lined with our lazy excuses about the times we were too insecure to say anything against the rape jokes that are never funny. Speaking up is real, too. From our dorm rooms in which we tell our roommates to the SHARE office to speak with trained staff to the pages of this newspaper in which we tell our campus, speaking up is the tool we all have to fight injustice.|~|

64867|~|On privilege|~|   May 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|Around the time when sophomores were supposed to begin declaring their majors, I was talking to a female student at dinner about a friend of mine who was seriously considering Classics as his department of choice. He had taken classes in the department and excelled within this incredibly intellectual field of study. In consideration of the “white privilege” conversation that has been circulating, I will say that my friend is a white, heterosexual male from a fairly well off background — a legacy no less — but keep in mind that the student at dinner didn’t know that. Despite knowing nothing about my friend’s background except for his race and gender, as well as making false assumptions regarding the difficulty of certain humanities departments such as Classics, the girl at dinner said “it’s probably because he can afford to be a Classics major.” And I wondered what this meant. Recently, Tal Fortgang ’17 wrote about his experience with “white privilege”  in The Princeton Tory, specifically elaborating on the phrase “check your privilege” when used in conversation. While I enjoyed the writing and felt my heartstrings pulled by the intimate stories of his family’s struggle in order to achieve what they now have, I didn’t feel particularly compelled by his argument, though I did feel sorry for the circumstances that led him to write this article. Firstly, I agree with columnist Mitchell Hammer ’17 that “privilege can be independent of your family’s past … [or] of real hardship you or your ancestors may have endured.” Suppose I, too, believed Fortgang to have white privilege. I wouldn’t have been convinced by his recounting of his family’s narrative because he didn’t personally overcome those challenges; he heard about them, just as any of us would listen and internalize the stories our parents would tell us. Personally, my parents grappled with difficult financial states during their college years, taking on a variety of odd jobs and working ridiculous hours just to pay their college tuitions during a time when financial aid wasn’t so good for international students. However, their struggle just “to get by” never really fueled my understanding of what it means to have to count dollar by dollar how much I make during a part-time job. I nonetheless feel privileged in spite of and separate from my parents’ experience and I don’t believe that a retelling of their life stories would or should persuade a peer that I know anything about what it’s like to not be privileged. However, I disagree with Hammer’s statement that privilege is “living your life free from consideration and hyper-awareness of your race, gender or sexuality.” “White privilege” in itself makes the target hyper-aware of his identity as a white, heterosexual male and in itself almost seems to try to make these characteristics shameful. In the case of my conversation with the girl at dinner, had I told her that I was planning to become a Classics major, I’m almost positive she wouldn’t have thought that “I could afford to do that,” as easily as she had thought that about my friend. She might have assumed many things, including that I might just be good at Classics and that this was a risk worth it for me to take. But why can’t my friend just be good at Classics? Why does the consideration of his race, gender and sexuality — and especially the supposed “safety net” of his family’s socioeconomic background — automatically overshadow his merit, abilities and choices as a student? Phrases such as “white privilege” force unfair baggage upon students of the identity in consideration, delegitimizing their experiences without regard for their actual narratives. Frankly, I was surprised when Fortgang’s article came out and somewhat disappointed that our campus had made him feel the need to expose his family’s wounds in order to make a point. Could it be that discourse on campus has become so careless and judgmental that comments such as “check your privilege” manage to push a student such as Fortgang into a domain in which he feels the need to research his family’s misfortunes and present them to his peers in order for them to consider him in conversation? While qualifications of each speaker matter in a debate, sometimes certain characteristics of the speaker such as white, heterosexual or male shouldn’t have a weight in comparison with the strength and quality of his argument. After all, if they did, then this could hardly be the intellectual and open sphere of academic dialogue that most of us signed up for when we decided to come to Princeton.|~|Isabella Gomes is an ecology and evolutionary biology major from Irvine, Calif.

64869|~|Keeping busy to ourselves|~|   May 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ali Akram Hayat|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“You look terrible! How much sleep did you get last night?” This is a weird question to entertain for two reasons. Firstly, because it strikes a fine balance between concern and backhanded slight, and I don’t know the kind of impression it is supposed to give off. Secondly, and more importantly, because I know where the conversation is headed. “Less than four hours, so I feel really tired right now. I was actually up Sky—” “Oh, I can totally imagine. I’ve been having a rough week, too. I have 31 papers and then a presentation for my [insert name of language course here] due tonight, and then, you know, my popular and exclusive dance group has practice for 26 hours a day, and I also need to set up for the XYZ conference that I am running for the highly selective business organization you tried out for earlier this year but didn’t get into.” “—ping with my parents. Just talking and catching up.” “Oh, well how lucky. I never have the time to do that sort of stuff anymore. Not all of us are so fortunate.” Okay, so maybe I’ve employed a bit of hyperbole in the imagined conversation above, but the point I’m trying to get across is very real: We Princeton students love to glamorize how busy we are. There is a sense of pride that we feel when we recount precisely how much work we have to do, and how important that work is. Be it problem sets, papers, presentations and readings for classes, extracurricular commitments or even social interactions, it is automatically assumed that the busier one is, the closer we are to doing Princeton the ‘right’ way. Prianka Misra’s column from over a year ago also talks about this phenomenon. She considers it part and parcel of Princeton life, our mechanism to induce “healthy competition” among our peers, and to serve as a “stress reliever” against the workload we bear. I have a more cynical view on this. Complaining about how busy one is uses workload and its associated stress to appear to be agitated, while actually bragging about it — linking workload with success and making sure everyone knows this. Let me clarify something. I don’t mean to assert that Princeton students aren’t under a lot of pressure. Sleep is rightly considered a luxury on many nights. I do not think, however, that being busy is not an automatic sign of success. The “once in a lifetime opportunity” argument that is often touted in support for being involved in a multitude of things on campus can be flipped, too. This is also a once in a lifetime opportunity for self-growth, to reach out to peers around you, to have conversations, to discover passions beyond items that can make our résumé’s shinier. My other issue is with the way we advertise all that we do. With thinly veiled, halfhearted attempts at hiding this self-promotion with complaining, we constantly try to validate our actions and larger experience by letting people know exactly how busy — and hence how on top of our work — we are. Of course, boasting openly about one’s achievements became socially unacceptable after middle school, but this alternative isn’t much better either. Not only is it a cheap attempt to cover boasting behind a façade, it is a symptom of a larger culture at Princeton. I have seen it in the disdainful looks I receive when I tell people that I did nothing “productive” (used in a strictly one-dimensional way) that day, or in their fake bouts of jealousy at how much free time I seem to have. Come on, we both know that you’re not jealous at all. In fact, it is quite the opposite. This becomes even more ridiculous when other less-than-appetizing facets of campus life are mixed with this. Complaining about the work assigned to us by selective groups is not just that we have a lot of work, but also that only we were deemed worthy of this work. This kind of peer pressure forces one model of success upon everyone and discourages alternate lifestyle by equating busyness with success and hence free time with failure. It brings the already widespread competitiveness on campus to everyday conversation, and breeds a sense of deflation among those not doing enough by these exacting standards. We carry our busy schedules on our sleeves, ready to spontaneously erupt into a soliloquy about how awful (read: awesome) our lives are, and by extension and perhaps more worryingly, how unsuccessful those who aren’t quite so busy are. I think that it’s important that we all chill out a little, and take the time to make free time. And if that is too hard, we can at least keep it to ourselves.|~|Ali Akram Hayat is a sophomore from Lahore, Pakistan. He can be reached at ahayat@princeton.edu.

64858|~|Editorial: An immediate response to the national attention on campus sexual assault|~|   May 3 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|On April 29, the White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault released its inaugural report on sexual assault on college campuses. The report comes after a series of widely publicized sexual assault cases at our peer institutions like Harvard, Columbia and Brown, in which students have charged their administrations with failing to provide justice for sexual assault survivors. The White House report aims to strengthen federal enforcement of sexual assault legislation, and provide schools with additional tools to combat a problem that continues to plague colleges across the nation. Its first and primary recommendation is that schools begin to administer “climate surveys,” in which students anonymously report their experiences with sexual assault. The survey helps to measure not only the frequency of sexual assault on campus, but also student perceptions of that climate and knowledge of available resources. The White House has provided a free survey-guide, and “urges schools to show they’re serious about the problem by conducting the survey next year (2014-2015).” Concurrently, the Justice Department is beginning a pilot program at Rutgers. At the end of that trial, it plans to explore the option of requiring schools to conduct a survey in 2016. On May 1, the U.S. Department of Education followed on the White House report by releasing a list of 55 schools under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights for alleged mishandling of sexual assault and harassment. Princeton is among those schools under investigation. Particularly in light of this fact, the Editorial Board see no need for Princeton to wait until next year before taking action on the White House’s recommendations. The Editorial Board recommends that the University require graduating seniors to complete a supplemental questionnaire on sexual assault before graduation. As part of the “Check-Out” process, Princeton requires graduating seniors to take a slew of mandatory surveys — including a general survey on the Princeton experience and more specific questionnaires such as one on international opportunities — and the Board believes that a sexual assault climate survey could readily be added.  While we recommend that the survey has an “opt-out” button to insure sensitivity toward sexual assault survivors, it should otherwise comply with the White House’s guide, which provides clear instruction in respect to polling methodology and offers a mélange of questions Princeton can draw upon. The results of the survey, in aggregated form, should be open to the public. Princeton’s late finishing date is seen by many as a curse, but now, it presents an opportunity. Princeton can pilot a sexual assault survey this year so it can be perfected for next academic year. Further, polling the graduating class will provide a means of gathering input from of a group of students who have had the “full” Princeton experience, and can thus offer a valuable perspective. Measuring the scope of the problem is a critical first step in addressing sexual assault at Princeton. According to the White House’s survey, “one in five women is sexually assaulted while in college.” Publicizing the extent of the problem may make survivors more comfortable coming forward. Beyond that, the anonymous survey in and of itself will likely present a form of healing for some. As the White House report notes, studies suggests that many college-aged students actually report mental benefits from partaking in surveys on interpersonal violence. In that same vein, Princeton’s climate survey may bring some students comfort that they are contributing to a solution by sharing experiences they are not comfortable discussing freely . Further, a climate survey may help improve Princeton’s response to sexual assault cases. Thus, the Board recommends that the survey measures how the University has responded to sexual assault cases, in order to expose any injustices. While publicized isolated cases provide powerful narratives of mismanagement, aggregated numbers help to illustrate broader trends. The survey should also measure students’ knowledge of existing resources and campus policies to make sure that communication efforts are proceeding effectively. We would like to highlight that while participating in a survey could be part of recovery for some sexual assault survivors, we recognize that participation may cause distress to others, who feel they are forced to re-live their experience of victimization. As such, the University should offer an opt-out button for the entire survey, and also for each individual question. This methodology is already in practice for Princeton’s system for conducting Course Evaluations, and can be easily implemented here. As an anonymous column in The Daily Princetonian noted, “rape culture” continues to afflict Princeton’s campus. By acting now, the University would send a powerful message to the community that it is committed to tackling the problem of sexual assault.|~|
64697|~|Princeton's mental health obligation |~|   May 1 2014|~|Columns Mental Health Opinion |~|Lauren Davis|~|   Columnist     |~|“So what exactly did you do on your year off?” I always pause before answering this question. I’ve avoided giving in-depth details about my experience withdrawing from Princeton two years ago — the reasons for it, and the process it entailed — to anyone but my closest friends. But it continues to disturb me at the most visceral level to read headlines about depression, self-harm and death. As a rule, I don’t watch news stories or read articles with vivid details, knowing that doing so might trigger the debilitating anxieties and intrusive thoughts that drove me to leave campus mid semester, sobbing and utterly overwhelmed. I’ve come a long way since then and have thankfully since returned to Princeton with the tools to manage my emotions and my obsessive, anxious mind. The experience left me with an adamant belief that everyone should prioritize finding balance in their mental state. Just ask my friends — I’m often referred to as “the mental health lady.” But already, after a year and a half back on campus, I feel myself subtly yet profoundly sucked back into the default culture of endless striving, stressing and overcommitting. There’s something unique about this campus’s inability or unwillingness to speak the language of mental health and holistic wellness­, that to speak openly and honestly on a day-to-day basis requires a huge amount of effort. And it’s this solid silence that breeds the fear and stigma that make seeking professional help, or taking time off feel so needlessly alienating. So if there is any power in dredging up troubling events from two years ago that I’d rather move on from, this is the moment to do so. I need to add my voice to the others, such as the anonymous contributor who bravely spoke up about their own ongoing struggles and negative experiences with the administration, and the valuable discussions between students and the University regarding withdrawal policies and mental health. When I made the decision to voluntarily leave Princeton, I, like this contributor, felt a great sense of fear that I may not be readmitted if the University deemed me not well-enough or a liability. I feared revealing details about the strange and disturbing things happening in my thoughts, which ironically only made them worse. The dark, claustrophobic sense of shame is ideal breeding ground for disordered thinking. But at the time, I knew so strongly that I could not cope that I needed to leave to take care of myself and become well. Luckily, I had the financial resources and family emotional support to do that. I withdrew knowing I was entering a safe environment where I would get the help I needed. Others are not so lucky. I also remember the letter that arrived in the mail from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students about a month after I arrived home informing me I would be subject to a required evaluation by Counseling and Psychological Services before I could return. At that lowest of low moments, when I still did not have a handle on my mental state, that letter filled me with a deep sense of dread and total alienation from my friends and my life as a Princeton student. The choice to leave and take care of myself felt less like freedom than a sentence of exile. Many months later, as I handed my therapist the mandatory reevaluation form, I secretly feared that she might write something — or that the CPS evaluator would find some fault in what she wrote — that would jeopardize my readmission, even though we both knew by then that I was more than well enough to return. As an educational institution, Princeton does not have an obligation — moral or legal — to be liable for every student’s health. But it does have a moral obligation to educate its students in how to become emotionally wise. It is no good whatsoever trying to be “in the Nation’s Service and in the Service of all Nations” if you do not know first how to help yourself. The gifted people that Princeton selectively admits are the same people who are also most prone to depression and anxiety, especially in a high-pressure environment, and Princeton must acknowledge and help students themselves to understand this fact. Highly active and sensitive minds are praised only for their “strengths” — intellect, drive and perfectionism — while the other inevitable aspects of having such a mind — its emotional variability and tendency for extremes — are stigmatized and subtly condemned as weaknesses. The institution needs to do some serious rethinking of how it writes and publicizes its policies, and how it spends its budget on mental health resources. It needs to more clearly recognize and communicate the limits of its ability to assume liability for students, instead of purporting to be a warm nest that will unconditionally support you for four years. It is not a healthcare facility, nor should it be, and should not be expected to fund long-term therapy. But it needs to give students the tools to learn how to be wise enough to help themselves so that they can then be of service to others.  As I wrote in a previous column, I believe this campus desperately needs an organization — along the lines of the SHARE model — that trains students in basic counseling techniques who can then serve as go-betweens between students and professionals in CPS or in private practices. This Mental Health Peers organization needs to be friendly, vocal and public from the beginning of freshman orientation until the day students graduate. I want this conversation to continue to involve students, the administration, the CPS counselors themselves. I want to hear what the challenges they all face, and I want us to work towards an integrated solution. Princeton will always be an institution first, not a community. But among ourselves, we can create the kind of community a legal entity cannot. These debates are important not just because they affect the health and happiness of a few thousand students while they are at the University, though that should be reason enough. These debates­ are vital because the attitudes and cultures towards mental well-being that students experience while at Princeton will come to shape their outlooks and actions later in life–towards their co-workers, their families and friends. Right now, most Princeton students leave campus with a subconscious belief that to admit vulnerability is weakness. Many will continue, after graduating, on the same unstable trajectory of over-taxing themselves and neglecting their inner lives. Some will be fine. Others will not. An acceptance of the fact that we all need to look after our minds as well as our bodies is an attitude sorely lacking in U.S. culture generally: in workplaces, where there is discrimination against disorders such as depression, in families, and in the very education system itself, which fundamentally views students as intellectual, not emotional, beings. Princeton, with its social and political influence, has the opportunity to become a crucial force in beginning to remedy this flawed culture. It could choose to join the slow but noble effort of companies like Google, which has instituted meditation and mindfulness practices in an effort to help employees maintain a balanced and contented mental state, or high profile individuals like Scott Stossel, the editor of The Atlantic, who published a long and highly personal piece about his struggle with anxiety, one of the nation’s most common disorders. The latter gives me hope that I am not ruining my own future career prospects by admitting that I have struggled with anxiety and depression myself. And frankly, if a future employer stumbles across this article and does not want to hire me as a result, then it’s clearly not the right place for me. A year and a half ago, I was readmitted to Princeton, but there are others in situations similar to mine who may not be. Let’s make sure this can be the right place for them.|~|Lauren Davis is a philosophy major from London, England. She can be reached at lhdavis@princeton.edu. 
64680|~|Editorial: Lawnparties improvements|~|   May 1 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The beginning and end of the academic year bring one of Princeton’s most cherished traditions: the biannual Lawnparties concert. As an integral part of the Princeton undergraduate experience, it is imperative that the USG continues to improve the day-long event. And so it has tried, creating controversy through its choice of artist and major change in donating a portion of proceeds to charity. The Editorial Board would like to address aspects of this spring’s Lawnparties, particularly these controversies, and offer potential solutions. First, the Editorial Board calls for increased transparency in the choice of headliners. The Board makes no judgment as to the quality of GRiZ and Mayer Hawthorne as this spring’s headliners. However, when a prank email announcing JoJo and Nickelback as the headliners generates more buzz than the actual headliners themselves, it is clear that student body input in choosing this spring’s artists was lacking. The opacity of the artist selection process can be easily remedied, as has been done in past years. Surveys have previously been sent out to the entire student population soliciting suggestions for Lawnparties acts and genres. The USG would then take these responses into high consideration when choosing headliners. While there can be no artist that satisfies the musical desires of every student on campus, active solicitation of student opinion would represent a conscious effort by the USG to, as the saying goes, “give ‘em what they want.” Furthermore, the way TEAM Charter Schools was selected as the designated charity for this spring’s Lawnparties was unfortunate. Again, while the Board passes no judgment on the nonprofit itself, the fact that a charity with ties to both USG members and, more importantly, an extremely controversial public education plan was selected without any student input is disconcerting at best. The Board supports donating Lawnparties proceeds to charity (as we wrote last year); however, as we advocated, any choice like this must be made with substantial deliberation and conversation between the USG and the student body at large, not behind closed doors. If the USG continues to donate proceeds to charities for future Lawnparties events, the Board strongly suggests future surveying of the undergraduate population. In the unlikely scenario that a poll to the student body could not be administered due to, for example, time constraints, then a generally less controversial organization should have been chosen. The Board supports incorporating community giving into Lawnparties, just not the way it was executed this year. On a less critical note, the Board suggests that University Dining Services should open residential college dining halls at weekday operating hours for the day of Lawnparties. It is inevitable that some students will drink on the day of Lawnparties, as the event is tied to student-hosted parties and underage alcohol consumption. Consequently, though the University is not immediately liable for students if they choose to drink, given that it funds this concert, the University should take some initiative in trying to protect these students. Seven students being transported to medical facilities during this past fall’s Lawnparties is seven students too many, and a simple action such as opening the dining halls earlier can help protect students who may be consuming alcohol on empty stomachs. Regular weekday breakfast hours during Lawnparties weekend would provide an extremely accessible way for students to eat and help mitigate more serious alcohol-related problems. Lawnparties is perhaps the most-loved University-sponsored semiannual event, and while the Editorial Board appreciates the steps the USG has taken to maintain and improve the weekend, we take concern with this year’s lack of transparency in both artist selection and, new this year, charity selection. The Board strongly recommends that the USG actively seeks student opinion in the decision-making process for both headliners and potential charities. Moreover, the Board is concerned by the multiple alcohol-related medical transports to the Princeton Medical Center this past fall and calls for earlier dining hall hours to help mitigate this problem. Lawnparties should be a safe and fun event for as many students as possible, and making such changes would only continue to improve this integral Princeton experience.|~|Zach Horton abstains.

64550|~|Closing the 'confidence gap'|~|   April 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Cameron Langford|~|None|~|In an April 14 article from The Atlantic, Katty Kay and Claire Shipman explored the well documented “confidence gap” between men and women. Women, they found, are consistently likely to underrate their abilities, to credit others with their own success and to take fewer risks. Though equally competent, women are consistently less confident in their abilities. And Princetonians are not immune: Female students feel less comfortable speaking out in precept, running for leadership positions or applying for fellowships, and they are more likely to feel like imposters who were mistakenly admitted (a phenomenon I wrote about last year). Both on- and off-campus, solutions have encouraged women to play with the boys by simply being more confident. Like Nike, their slogan is “just do it.” Sheryl Sandberg, for example, encourages women to “lean in” in the corporate setting, pushing aside their fear of failure and instead trusting in their abilities to take on leadership roles alongside their male colleagues. Similarly, in a column last fall, Marni Morse urged female students to speak up in class even when they weren’t sure about what they were saying. Never mind that confident women are more likely to be perceived as arrogant or even bitchy: The 1969 “BITCH Manifesto” declares, “Bitch is Beautiful,” and celebrates the Bitch for discarding female norms in favor of her less likeable male counterparts. The message of these credos is clear: Women should feel comfortable being confident, and men shouldn’t shame them for doing so. But as much as I applaud Sandberg and the other “bitches” who have paved the way for strong, intelligent women to speak up and lean in, these solutions do little to actually address the confidence deficit underlying the problem of female leadership and participation. If we want to tackle the confidence gap, we have to start at the root: by fostering confidence in women. We can’t simply assume that confidence is a trait that women can conjure out of thin air or that all women have some hidden tide of confidence burbling under their timid, ladylike exteriors. The confidence gap is not, I believe, a problem of expression; women are not less confident just because they feel uncomfortable flying in the face of feminine social norms by being smart, sassy and loud. Rather, the confidence gap starts internally, at the individual level. Many women have a deeply ingrained belief that they’re just not as capable as they actually are. The article from The Atlantic points to an experiment involving math tests where women performed on par with their male peers but, before they knew the results, rated their scores lower. This lack of confidence may be as much biological as social: Kay and Shipman note that the anterior cingulate cortex (which they refer to as “the worrywart center” of the brain) is larger in female brains, offering one potential explanation for the observation that women are more likely to focus on flaws in their work. These brain differences need not be viewed as deterministic, but they do help explain why women are less willing to participate in precept, run for leadership positions or apply for fellowships. On the societal level, too, it explains the paucity of women in the upper echelons of business. Women simply figure that they just aren’t good enough and often don’t even bother trying to succeed. For this reason, a solution to the confidence gap requires more than a call to “lean in.” It requires encouraging women that they are competent enough to do so in the first place. So how do we foster confidence in female students? The solution is likely to be much larger and multi-tiered than I can sketch in 800 words. But I know that in my own experience, a professor or preceptor’s assurance that my voice matters can make all the difference. I am compelled to speak up in precept, for example, when a preceptor references a point I’ve made in a reading response or paper. I feel capable in my ability to compete for internships, fellowships or jobs when professors make a point of letting me know they are happy to write me a recommendation. Where internal confidence is lacking, external confidence can foster it. Of course, precepts and seminars are discussion-based events by definition. And the business world needs people who are willing to be bossy and loud and, well, bitchy. I don’t mean to suggest that women need not speak up or lean in. But I do want to argue that rather than putting the onus on women to simply be confident, authority figures have a role to play in offering assurances of competence that might help foster confidence at the individual level. If we want women to truly gain confidence — rather than to only occasionally project it — that will take a more measured and deeper approach than to “just do it.” We will have to tell women that their voice matters enough to make speaking up worth doing at all.|~|Cameron Langford is a politics major from Davidson, N.C.

64577|~|Rape culture exists here, too|~|   April 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Anonymous|~|None|~|Editor’s note: The author of this column was granted anonymity due to the intensely personal nature of the events described. I never intended to write an op-ed or share my story of sexual assault. My thoughts on this subject have generally already been expressed well by others. However, in this instance my ability to speak from personal experience can make a unique contribution to the discussion on campus. The idea to publicly discuss my rape from my freshman year has coalesced over the last semester. By now, I have realized that the relevance of sexual assault is not perceived immediately on campus. In my freshman year, I heard students bravely share their assault stories at Take Back the Night, an event honoring survivors. However, this important event has a limited impact and scope because of its self-selecting audience. I know from the rape jokes my friends repeatedly and casually tell that many students assume rape is something that doesn’t happen here or does not personally happen in our friend groups. This is not true. Rape affects a larger segment of our population than almost any other crime, but it has incredibly low report and conviction rates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 19 percent of college-aged women have experienced an attempted or completed sexual assault since entering college (which is not to say that sexual assault does not occur for males). When it happened to me, I was in the Sexual Health/Assault Advising, Research & Education program. I was trained to communicate, recognize and/or intervene in the risk of an assault. Because I was in SHARE, I felt like I should have been able to prevent rape from happening to me. And most of all, after the fact I was confused, with muddled memories and impressions of the memories. I chose not to consider it “rape with a capital R” because I did not want to – was not ready to — associate myself with The R-Word. I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt and chose not to cast him as a perpetrator. After all I was a self-aware, trained young woman — sexual assault could hardly happen to me or on my watch, right? But it did. It can happen to anyone. It happened to me at a formal freshman year. To go to the formal, I pulled an all-nighter the evening before on a writing seminar paper.  I was so tired that I lapsed in and out, in my head, from being in the room to carrying on conversations with people whom I thought, but were not, there. I remember being given two mixed drinks. I remember returning to the eating club from the formal and following everyone down a flight of stairs. That was the last thing I remembered until, stirred by a vague impression of pain, I knew I was whimpering and in an unanticipated room. It was dark and he was there – but my clothes were not. I could not leave. The lack of sleep was worse than the alcohol. Consent would not have been possible. Part of why I never considered it in terms of “rape” is that after a while, he eventually stopped. At some point, he eventually grasped that I was a virgin. He freaked out, adamant that he should not have sex with me — my first time should be saved for something special, he said. What does it say about the scenario and our culture that he only paused because he thought as he said, that “my first time should be saved for something special?” Is consent not necessary your second, third or 30th time? We should not consider as “special” a sexual experience during which someone does not disregard your agency or ability to consent. Consent and vocal solicitation of consent should be the norm every time. The idea that consent is implied, or not necessary, with someone who has been sexually active in the past is wrong. We should not start from a place of implicit assumption of consent or sexual choices, where stopping is only a reactionary response. It’s never OK to rape people, be it their first, second, third or 30th time. The part that tortures me is that I had been conditioned by society to believe that sex was a compliment. My freshman year I had no idea how “the hookup culture” worked. I was miserable and starved for friendships like others I had seen. I thought that what had happened could be how some friendships started. I was surprised anyone at the time would want to be close enough to me to have sex with me. Because of this, I warped my experience into a should-be positive thing. I have fought for the opportunity to publish this in The Daily Princetonian, and I am telling my story because I want to offer one image of sexual assault’s face on this campus. I started to remember all of this when a boyfriend asked me questions about “my first time.” He got more upset than me. He spat vehemently, ‘I hate him,’ But I do not hate my perpetrator. I do not think he was or is a bad person, and I am capable of forgiving him. Nor do I hate the eating clubs or varsity sports teams or the Greek system, institutions that are sites of sexual assault on college campuses across the nation. Eating clubs are not the problem. I hate the culture — the rape culture — that creates otherwise decent people who do completely indecent things. This culture exists here, at other Ivies, at other colleges and outside of college environments entirely. Beyond the eating clubs, rape culture already manifests itself elsewhere on campus. There is no stereotypical picture of where, or to whom, sexual assault occurs or does not occur. Within this culture, we view men’s aggressive behavior as an acceptable norm. When survivors and their allies try to challenge these aspects of culture we are brushed aside, entirely because they are so engrained. Given the high instance of sexual assault in America, in combination with some of the lowest reporting rates among all crimes, we should not question the legitimacy of those who may have been terrified to put to words what happened to them. Statistically, someone in your precept or hallway has had it happen to him or her. All of these survivors’ narratives need to be listened to and validated. Norms can change and I challenge us all — students on all college campuses — to change them.|~|

64520|~|The importance of languages|~|   April 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|At dinner parties, family gatherings, and impromptu meetings with old teachers, there are always the standard questions. How do I like college? What am I involved with on campus? What am I studying? Then come the rote responses so ingrained in my mind that I don’t even have to ponder how I really am doing or how I spend my time. College is wonderful; I love it. I do this and that and whatever. I am a prospective Spanish and Portuguese languages major with planned certificates in creative Writing and Latin American studies. The adults in my life nod along for a bit, willing to approve of my extracurricular activities and general outlook on college life. And then they do a double take as they process my third response. “Spanish? Creative writing? Latin American studies?” Here, it is my turn to nod and to prepare myself for the inevitable follow-up question. “What are you going to do with that?” “I want to be an author,” I reply. I have wanted to ever since third grade, when I learned of metaphors and similes and translated my love of books and language into a direction. Here, the conversation generally grinds to a halt, and I inquire after their more practical vocations. But, this time, I don’t want the discussion to end here. I am a prospective Spanish and Portuguese languages and cultures major with planned certificates in creative writing and Latin American studies. I want to be an author. And there’s nothing wrong with this, just as there is nothing wrong with declaring oneself to be an aspiring electrical engineer or a biology major bound for medical school. This is my defense of the language major, of the “impracticality” of devoting one’s time to an intrinsic part of what it means to be human and a major component of most cultures. As an aspiring author, I consider it my duty to strive to understand the manner in which others think and process this world in which we live. One can explore the human psyche through psychology, anthropology, sociology, biology and a variety of other subjects. I don’t deny this. I simply contend that languages offer a window through which one can view the mores of societies around the world through subtle syntactical and vocabulary-based differences. One such difference has been well documented in various neuroscience and psychology papers: namely, the perception of time often changes according to one’s native language. Time itself is such an abstract, yet universal, entity, so it stands to reason that interpretations of the concept may vary. In the words of a paper entitled “How Languages Construct Time,” written by Stanford researcher Lera Boroditsky, “How people conceptualize time appears to depend on how the languages they speak tend to talk about time, the linguistic context (what language is being spoken), and also on the particular metaphors used to talk about time in the moment.” To be able to harness the flexibility of thought to try to understand various representations of something so crucial to human existence is a powerful thing. This example, one could argue, is very narrow in its scope. Yes, by learning Spanish, French and other languages, I can perceive time in a slightly different way — beyond this, however, the lens through which I view the world and understand others’ actions is bending and widening. Maybe alone, the perception of time, knowledge of idiomatic phrases or the ability to understand foreign jokes don’t seem to have the ability to influence the work one does in his or her life. I contend, however, that in conjunction with each other and with many subtle shifts in perspective, they can. When you step outside yourself; when you begin to understand the nuances of another person’s point of view; when you immerse yourself in a new environment, you’re becoming the ideal mediator in a world in which misunderstanding reigns. Languages, of course, are not the only way to achieve this, but in my opinion they are one of the best, as they represent methods of thought and the stringing together of ideas. This is why I’m a language major, and this is why I take issue with the assertion that this is a “useless” path to choose. A more comprehensive understanding of the world can be applied to any occupational realm, and, in my case, it will hopefully allow me to write legitimately about the diverse people who inhabit our world.|~|Kelly Hatfield is a freshman from Medford, Mass.

64340|~|Art for everyone |~|   April 29 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|The end of the academic year is a beautiful and terrible time. I woke up the other day, dreading the load of work and studying I have to accomplish by May 22. But almost simultaneously, I realized that the coming four weeks would be over in the blink of an eye. I could have done a number of things with this realization: scramble to begin my Dean’s Date assignments, make a pitiful attempt to start running with bikini season on the horizon or even plan some awesome to-dos for my few weeks of downtime during the summer. I opted for none of these. I went to shows. A musical, martial arts action-adventure show: “Journey Beyond the West: The New Adventures of Monkey.” The diSiac show, “On the Edge,” which undoubtedly lived up to its name. And just this past weekend, I attended the tale of “Sweeney Todd,” an amazingly chilling yet somehow comical musical that managed to blow me away even with Mother Nature literally raining on our parade. Admittedly, before attending each of these performances, I felt a tinge of guilt. There was some sort of assignment I could be working on, something for an extracurricular that needed handling. Really, any semblance of productivity would have made me happy. But I can honestly say that by the end of every show, there were no remnants of guilt left. I’m at the point in my college career when I know myself, work-wise. I know when I’m going to actually get assignments done and when I’m going to just be thinking about a show I wish I were going to. There’s no point in not getting work done and missing a cool opening show at Theatre Intime. But then, even if there is some reading I could be doing, going to a musical, a play or an art exhibit — it’s never unproductive. Though I’m not privy to the dedication leading up to a show, I can only imagine the blood, sweat and tears that go into a major student production. The lines at the ticket office always annoy me, but, really, it would be a problem if they didn’t exist. We need to cheer on our friends and fellow students in general who are endeavoring to create something more than a paper or presentation. But going to student performances is more than supporting people we know. I go for myself because in truth, it is scarily simple to dismiss this part of life. I never realized that my seemingly little involvement in art affected my personal happiness so much. But in that hurried transition from high school to Princeton, I managed to leave behind writing, choir and musicals. It wasn’t until I returned to this part of myself — through my opinion columns, through my a cappella group — that I realized just how much I needed it. Unfortunately, I don’t think I will ever be as involved in the arts as I was in high school. My time is limited, and, as many students do, I have found new interests that also demand attention. Still, even if I’m not always the creator, there’s something magical about watching creation. But I think this gets more lost than being actively involved in the arts. At least if I’m painting something, memorizing lines or rehearsing a piece, I can say I have worked toward a goal. This translates to any piece of academic work. Though I’ve produced work that I am genuinely proud of in these past two years, I feel that a by-product of this is that if I’m not holding something tangible, there is nothing truly productive happening. It’s a dangerous line of thinking that “doing” is the only way to experience something and grow from it. University culture encourages action — academic, social, civic — and that’s a good thing. But often times, these actions become a series of monochromatic motions, and we become disconnected from our original motivations and the effects that we’d hope to see happen. Art slows down time. In an almost breathless pace of life, rather than acting or doing, art gives us an opportunity to observe windows of life and reflect on what they signify. In doing so, we reconnect with ourselves, each other and, incidentally, become a part of the art itself.|~|Lea Trusty is a Wilson School major from Saint Rose, La.

64332|~|My brother, Jon|~|   April 29 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|David Will|~|None|~|My oldest brother, Jon, is 41 years old and has Down Syndrome. I’ve never shied away from explaining his condition to strangers. In fact, I am proud of all he’s accomplished in spite of his condition. But when a friend uses “retard” or any variant of the word, I usually just let it roll off my back, even though it stings every time. In doing so, I’ve been a coward. I haven’t mustered the strength to explain gently to my friends the hurtful effects of their language. So, in my final column for the ‘Prince,’ I’ve challenged myself to do just that. Words and phrases are free of hate in a vacuum. A term becomes insidious when it’s co-opted and perverted to belittle others. Each slur gains its potency from the history of hate that made it toxic. It is counterproductive, then, to liken the R-word to the N-word. People with intellectual disabilities face enduring prejudice but obviously nothing comparable to centuries of enslavement and disenfranchisement. The R-word is often deployed lightheartedly, free of any malicious intent. Even if a friend drops the R-word as a punchline, I know that he or she isn’t a virulent bigot. The term just isn’t freighted with the same evil history as, say, the N-word. But even unthinking, off-handed remarks can degrade, and a lack of cruel motive is no excuse to let the R-word slide. A word or phrase’s permissibility should be gauged by those who are allegedly offended by its use. This empowers potentially vulnerable minority groups to determine the point at which an innocent locution mutates into a slur. Here, however, people with intellectual disabilities are at a unique disadvantage: By virtue of their conditions, these men and women sometimes can’t be their own advocates. That’s where mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and friends like me come in. It’s a common misconception that having these kinds of conversations necessarily involves judgment or hostility. That’s ridiculous — we all have blind spots. I would hope that my friends would feel comfortable confronting me about any of my insensitivities. But discussions about prejudice — intended or not — are difficult to have, and it’s incumbent upon all of us to do better. In my experience, when most people casually use the R-word, they aren’t trying to belittle a specific class of people. Rather, these jokes are meant to liken someone or something to a nebulous conception of the inferior. The trouble is, the term still causes pain, and it does dehumanize an entire cohort regardless of the speaker’s intent. It’s up to advocates of the mentally disabled then to humanize the issue, to dispel the illusion of distance between the R-word and those whom it disparages. With that in mind, I’d like to introduce you to my big brother, Jon. Every day, he strides confidently and cheerfully into an uncertain world. Jon is at once the happiest and the bravest man I know. For my brother, just leaving home means hoping that every stranger he meets will be kind. And those of us who love Jon wake up every morning praying that a harsh world will spare him any hardships beyond the ones that already burden him. Despite all this, Jon thrives. My brother lives in semi-independent housing, derives dignity from a job that he enjoys and is unconditionally loved by his family, all of which insulate him from most of the world’s cruelty. What’s more, the D.C. metro, which he traverses with prowess, opens the city up to him. There is an inherent goodness within Jon that I have yet to encounter in anyone else. He has never been a burden, only a profound blessing. He calls each of my parents daily, and every time is sure to ask, “How is David?” Jon tries his best to keep up with my schoolwork, asking what’s due when, and expresses concern over my seemingly constant fatigue, just like any other devoted big brother. I aspire to be the kind of loving and faithful brother that Jon is to me. Part of that lifelong pursuit is conveying to others that people with intellectual disabilities — people like my brother — are worthy of respect. So, next time you catch yourself about to utter the R-word, stop for a moment and ask: Does the situation that provoked your reaction really remind you at all of Jon? If not, then take an extra second to find a more accurate and more innocent turn of phrase.|~|David Will is a religion major from Chevy Chase, Md. He can be reached at dwill@princeton.edu. 
64338|~|Reevaluating the effectiveness of writing seminar|~|   April 29 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Every Monday and Wednesday evenings, a handful of other freshmen and I meet for an hour and a half for our writing seminar. It makes sense. Many other colleges and universities have similarly mandatory courses implemented with the same goal of teaching “college writing.” These courses, including the University’s writing seminars, are meant to smooth out the crinkles of variation that exist across the high school experiences of every student by “focus[ing] on the skills necessary for effective critical reading and writing.” In my personal experience, however, the Princeton Writing Program has largely failed to achieve this goal. Instead of providing a preliminary course with basic lessons and strategies that each student encounters and eventually masters, the current writing program presents distinctly variable experiences in each of its courses. Of course, each of the specific topics the different courses use as their lenses to teach writing are provided in order to lessen the stressful ordeal of enduring a class focused either specifically on writing principles or on a topic that the student finds boring. Thus, students can have their pick (or at least provide a loud suggestion) of writing seminars on topics as disparate as WRI 125: Genius and WRI 177: Human Rights in an Age of Terror. This diversity of choice is seemingly beneficial. Students enroll in a seminar that vaguely piques their interest; professors gain a classroom of students who should be at least a bit more engaged than if they had been entirely forced to be there. Yet this diversity is precisely what leads to an unsuccessful writing program. Designed with the hopes of equalizing the differences in each student’s writing lexicon, the various choices of subject matter and distinct teaching styles required by such subjects are self-defeating. When I discuss my own writing seminar and compare it with those of my friends, it often seems the only real similarities are the titles of the major required assignments like Draft 1, Revision 1 and Draft 2, Revision 2. Some of my friends’ seminars seem to lean heavily on learning the devices included in the Writing Center’s lexicon while others seem to have barely delved further than the topic of “thesis” and “motive.” Some writing seminars even seem to focus more on the material they advertise in their course names rather than actually teaching students how to write essays at the collegiate level. The current writing seminar goals include, in addition to writing, the skill of critical reading. The various focuses of each writing seminar do not directly detract from this objective; however, the unaligned teaching styles and the lack of uniformity in smaller assignments within each seminar still contribute to an ineffective approach to teaching critical reading. Just skimming over the reviews of each seminar from last semester reveals that a broad range of reading assignments exists across the course list; some boast extensive reading lists while others have virtually no reading beyond a few primary articles. There also seems to be a vast disparity in the required accountability for students in different writing seminars. I have several friends who have professors who require a reflection statement for each reading to ensure that the assignment is actually completed (and completed thoughtfully) while many courses have no such system and barely reference assigned readings after the fact. Students therefore are able to evade reading more than the bare minimum necessary to complete their three essays throughout the semester. I myself am guilty of this, as I am sure others are, when assignments that are actually due quickly trump unenforced readings. Admittedly, this is a failing on the part of the student. However, it is a reality that must be reconciled somehow in a course meant to strengthen critical reading skills; it is difficult to teach critical reading skills when it is possible that students are not even reading. I am not necessarily suggesting that the writing program completely abolish the variety it offers to incoming freshmen. I do, however, believe that more uniformity must be incorporated into the existing system, structuring certain aspects of the courses to be congruous in the skills they teach students. While certainly not a panacea, Becky Kreutter’s column in October of last year arguing for more in-depth teaching of research skills provides a suggestion of how the reformation of the writing program could begin. Instead of reiterating the simple search engine basics most of the student body already knows (being able to navigate Google is the reason I’m here; I wouldn’t have found the Common App otherwise!), teaching students higher-level research strategies would not only prepare students for later on in their Princeton careers but would also promote critical reading skills. After all, the foundation of critical reading is the ability to sift through information and pick out what is crucial and what is not. In addition to greater development of research techniques, the writing program could also implement across-course requirements such as universal micro-writing assignments and reading reflections. Regardless of what action the University decides to take, the vastly different experiences freshmen have with their writing seminars suggest that the program is not achieving its goal.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

64185|~|Allow PDF and audit for introductory languages|~|   April 28 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Yotam Sagiv|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The liberal arts system rests on the principle of academic freedom. For four years, we are encouraged to take classes in fields we have never considered in order to become more well-rounded scholars and human beings. The University has put in place many mechanisms in order to help us facilitate this, not the least of which are the audit and PDF options. Indeed, these are the features that allow us to be exposed without risk to introductory courses in the fields of computer science, economics, physics, comparative literature and more. But, curiously, this option doesn’t exist in the languages. You cannot audit or PDF CHI 101: Elementary Chinese I, SPA 101: Beginner’s Spanish I, KOR 101: Elementary Korean I or JPN 101: Elementary Japanese I. This seems odd, considering the fact that the University places enough emphasis on learning a new language to make it a part of the A.B. general education requirements. Departmental Representative of East Asian studies Everett Zhang says that this is due to the fact that a typical grading system provides better motivation for students to work hard in the class, and consequently better prepares them for the higher-level courses they would need to take in order to either concentrate in, or get a certificate relating to, the language. In essence, a PDF option allows students to invest less effort in the course than they otherwise would — the consequences of which mean that they might be unprepared for further study in the field, and that the seriousness of the language requirement itself is undermined. While this is certainly valid, it does reduce the attractiveness of learning a new language; without the safety net provided by the audit and PDF options, a GPA-conscious student might recoil from the idea of risking a low grade in what are generally tough and time-consuming courses. Certainly, that’s the case for me —  if CHI 101 was offered with a PDF option, then I would be taking it next fall. As it is, I am not because of the class’s infamously bad curve. It is understandable that the University wants to enforce a serious attitude with regard to the language requirement — for many students, it is the only form of exposure to foreign culture and practice. However, the impact of this reaches beyond the set of A.B. students who have not yet finished their language requirement. It also impacts undergraduates who are not restricted by this prerequisite: those in the B.S.E. program and the A.B. students who are already finished with the language portion of their general education. By attempting to inspire intellectual growth in one group, this policy has stinted it across all others. There is a fairly simple solution to this. Instead of completely removing the PDF and audit options from introductory language courses, restrict those abilities to students for whom the language requirement is either completed or inapplicable. This allows students who want to learn a certain language to pursue their interests with lower risk, thereby encouraging the sort of cultural well-roundedness and linguistic exploration that the University aims to achieve with the language requirement in the first place. With regard to the possible drawback that once the PDF and audit options open up, students will put less effort into these classes and therefore get less out of them, it must be said that there is an element of truth to this. However, this viewpoint neglects the fact that these non-letter-grade avenues will be restricted to those who aren’t required to enroll in a language class. That is to say, the only people allowed to audit or PDF the class are those who took it solely out of genuine interest; these students are clearly self-motivated enough to take the class, so it is not an unreasonable assumption to say that they are also willing to put in effort to further their own learning. If they are PDFing a course, it is not out of laziness, but due to any combination of external factors such as free time, grades or course space. By disabling the PDF and audit options in introductory language courses, the administration has impeded the process of exploration that it attempts to foment in the student body; the removal of these safety nets has caused many students to be repelled from courses they would otherwise take. However, allowing undergraduates who have already demonstrated proficiency in a foreign language access to these options would free many students to chase after their linguistic interests while still maintaining the seriousness of the language requirement — opening up a whole new realm of cultural exploration for those for whom the risk is sufficient cause to stay away.

64171|~|Letter to the Editor: April 28, 2014|~|   April 28 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|On April 21, 2014, a powerful op-ed titled “My Lying, Smiling Face” was published anonymously in The Daily Princetonian. The most recent in a series of stories that highlight the lack of transparency regarding University withdrawal and readmission processes, it raises a number of pressing concerns regarding the University’s treatment of students experiencing serious mental health issues. Unfortunately, recent University responses have fallen short of fully addressing these concerns. As the Editorial Board has observed, students currently know little about the University’s withdrawal and readmission policies and practices. This lack of transparency leads to strong and legitimate concerns, as well as questions from students. Under what conditions will the University require a student to involuntarily withdraw? How are these decisions made? Under what circumstances may Counseling and Psychological Services share confidential information with administrators? When might students be forced to waive their confidentiality in order to remain at or return to school? What considerations are made when deciding whether a student should be allowed to return to campus? Are students properly supported throughout the readmission process? If these questions are considered on a case-by-case basis, what factors might play a role in evaluating each case? We appreciate the recent responses from the administration. However, these responses have not specifically addressed students’ pressing questions. In response to the Editorial Board’s call for greater transparency, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Students Michael Olin and University Health Services Executive Director John Kolligian responded with a letter to the editor, which states that students may be involuntarily withdrawn if a “student’s danger to himself or herself remains extremely high” and includes a reference to the Undergraduate Announcement. However, the letter does not explain how that evaluation is made. More recently, Vice President for Campus Life Cynthia Cherrey wrote a letter to the editor in which she asserts that University decisions about student mental health issues encompass only two factors: “what is in the best interest of the student and what is in the best interest of the other residents of this campus community.” However, the letter does not address what constitutes “best interest,” who decides it, and how it is decided. Additionally, the letter’s discussion of how the University gains information from students’ doctors raises serious concerns about the confidentiality of student records. There is also no direct mention of the onerous and unsupportive processes a student already struggling with mental health issues might face in order to return to campus. Finally, the letter ignores the deeply personal struggles shared in “My Lying, Smiling Face” by relegating it to being a recent op-ed. Ultimately, the press responses and printed policy do not address the pressing concerns and lingering questions students have, thus contributing to a lack of trust in the University and increased stigma surrounding mental health. Students fear they will be forced to waive confidentiality in order to demonstrate that they can safely remain on campus. The readmission procedures described in “My Lying, Smiling Face” are alarming — they impose stringent and extensive requirements which could impede any student’s ability to focus on healthy recovery while away from school. Furthermore, the lack of clear and detailed policies and practices promotes an unhealthy “us-versus-them” mindset among the student body and raises the perception that a student facing serious mental health issues may immediately face withdrawal for simply seeking treatment at CPS, thus deterring these students from seeking proper help. Only with open, clear and more direct communication can we rebuild trust between students and the University, and together improve mental wellness on campus. The USG Princeton Mental Health Initiative board, formed in early 2014, initially aimed to help improve mental wellness on campus by linking students to campus resources and encouraging awareness and positive discussion of mental health issues. Princeton Mental Health Week 2014 included a number of events and workshops to advance these goals. While our efforts have not yet yielded substantial policy reform, as the board moves forward, it is our foremost aim to spark continuous and constructive dialogue surrounding mental health among students and with administration in order to enact meaningful change. Some projects we are planning include gathering students’ concerns through focus groups, assessing the University’s mental health data from the American College Health Association National College Health Assessment and hosting discussions between students and administrators. These projects are geared toward encouraging students and administrators to engage in honest and open dialogue about mental wellness and mental health policies on campus, especially questions concerning withdrawal and readmission. As this issue affects our entire campus community, we invite and urge all students and administrators to be involved in this important work. We must work together to bring transparency and clarity to nebulous policies and practices, and to ensure that these policies and practices help — not harm — students. Let’s discuss openly our concerns and hopes. Let’s work to understand the situations and circumstances we all face. Let’s shed light on the intricacies and nuances of existing policies. Let’s work together to find innovative solutions that best serve the interests of students and our entire campus community alike. Change is imperative. Let’s make it happen.

64228|~|The privilege of knowing our peers |~|   April 28 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|My little sister came to town this past weekend. It was her first time visiting me at Princeton in my four years here, though, as a second semester junior in high school, I suppose it only recently became appropriate for her to spend an extended period of time here. Our time together was wonderful, as it always is: we ate delicious food, met up with fascinating people and enjoyed the California-esque weather (we’re from the Bay Area). The element, though, that characterized the weekend beyond any other was the phenomenal showcase of student talent that we were privileged to witness. Earth Day celebrations provided brief access into many of the varied artistic talents Princeton students possess. We saw ballet, singing, comedy, rap, hip hop and more. Each act was entertaining, well rehearsed and a tremendous showcase of ability. Saturday evening we went to see “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” an astounding performance with an angelic Ben Taub ’14 at its head. My sister and I are no strangers to Broadway, and that night had us more engaged than we had been in more established venues. That evening, when we went out to explore the Street, we danced to live music of different varieties, in multiple clubs. We also had tickets for other shows, “Margo in Margoland,” “Fashion Speaks,” and “The Drowsy Chaperone,” but time forced our over ambitious hands, and we had to make some decisions. It dawned on me that these remarkable talents are entertaining their peers on a regular basis and that it was silly that I need the excuse of a visitor to go out of my way to enjoy what everyone around me is so kind to offer. My first column in The Daily Princetonian (I am now waxing a bit of nostalgia, not yet saying goodbye to you all) was about a speech I attended by former chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, and how lucky I was to attend that. Those feelings are the same, and I still feel privileged, but this weekend helped me realize something important about Princeton. Exposure to professors and celebrity speakers is important to getting the most out of Princeton, but it is not Princeton’s strongest asset. The students are. Big speeches nicely punctuate our time here, and we are allowed exposure to those who change the world, transiently. What we ought to be thankful for, though, is that we are allowed constant exposure to our peers. It is both inside and outside the classroom that Princeton students shine. It is further remarkable that students still find the time to thrive in their schoolwork. The ability of the Princeton student to multitask and juggle varying types of engagement is one worth noting and worth learning. It took four years here and my little sister making the 3,000-mile trip for this thought to fully form, but it has, and I am thankful for it. In some ways, this weekend was poetic. In about a month I will be done with many years of schooling (the last four the most important and intense), and in about a month my sister will be taking her SAT; out with the old in with the new. I don’t want to let another weekend pass without taking advantage of the artistic offerings provided by my peers. Our time here is short, and while I have no major regrets, I have come to recognize the importance of stopping by the Frist Campus Center ticket counter and just asking “what is on for the weekend?” This advice is not Princeton-specific. I would recommend to my sister, wherever she goes, that she be no stranger to her Frist ticket counter equivalent. My sister is very studious, and, whether or not she comes to Princeton I hope that this weekend taught her, as it helped teach me, that in college there is so much learning to be done outside of the classrooms and libraries.|~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif.

64056|~|Editorial: Prefrosh, congratulations!|~|   April 27 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|As the college application season draws to a final close and the May 1 deadline for matriculation waits just around the corner, we hope to provide you with one final summary of the reasons why you should consider coming to this great University. It is rather unfortunate that this year you have been handed the short end of the stick with a condensed Princeton Preview program. We nonetheless hope you are taking this opportunity as a chance to see Princeton for what it truly is — not a magical, mysterious institution of higher education but a community of students, faculty and staff who are incredibly smart, engaging, approachable and nice. Princeton offers incredible opportunities to the students who choose to attend. While the list is truly endless, it is worthwhile to highlight a few of the great aspects that comprise a Princeton education. With approximately 5,200 undergraduate students, Princeton really does offer the best of both a small liberal arts education as well as the resources and opportunities of a large research institution. Additionally, with the number of graduate students at Princeton far fewer than half the number of undergraduates, professors who come to Princeton do so with the intention of teaching and working with undergraduates. It is expected and assumed that all students will develop meaningful relationships with multiple professors during their time at Princeton. Both the residential college system as well as the eating clubs allow for students to find and form communities within the already small undergraduate student body. And with the largest endowment per capita of any University in the world, you and your classmates will be given access to resources that will allow you to travel and pursue internships or projects that may have otherwise been all but impossible. Your classmates at Princeton will amaze you every day. Yes, some of them may be running international nonprofit organizations or their own start up technology companies, but more importantly these will be your best friends and peers in your academic and life pursuits. These will be the people with whom you’ll be working late or laughing, the people with whom you will sit around seminar tables as you grapple with challenging and exciting academic texts and ultimately the people with whom you will spend at least four years of your life growing. The decision of where you should attend college is a deeply personal one. While all of the schools from which you may be choosing have plenty of wonderful things to offer, your decision should come down to which school is the best fit for you. While you mull over your options for the final time, you should know that Princeton is a welcoming community in which students, alumni, faculty and staff truly look out for one another even after walking out of the FitzRandolph Gate. To quote an alumnus from the Class of 2000, “Two days may not be enough time to see deeply into the soul of an institution, but it is long enough to realize that it has one.” While Princeton is a school bustling with energy and filled with engaging students who are both passionate about their academic studies as well as their extracurricular and worldly pursuits, this does not make it unique among its peer institutions. What makes Princeton unique is, in fact, the soul of the institution — the humble love of Princeton and fellow Princetonians that all who have studied here share. The next four years of your life will be about learning, yes, but also growing, loving, succeeding, failing, struggling and having fun. And for this, there is no better place to attend than the “best damn place of all.”|~|

64036|~|You're not fooling us |~|   April 27 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|The mental health issues on campus have led to at least one good result: a subsequent discussion of these issues and their possible solutions. Over the past semester there have been numerous articles by students highlighting the problems with the mental health policy on campus that have sparked not only discussions, but also administrative responses. While I’m thrilled to see the administration is hearing students’ complaints, upon reading the responses I’m less optimistic about meaningful changes being made. So far, the administration has offered little as a direct response to the specific problems about which students have expressed concern. Rather, the administration is spewing an empty response that sounds nice but does not actually suggest they are seriously acknowledging the problems. This needs to stop. The administration has to stop worrying about Princeton’s image and must truly engage in a discussion of the problems at hand, so that together students and administrators can find real solutions to fix this and other problems around campus. Vice President of Campus Life Cynthia Cherrey’s recent letter to the editor is a perfect example of this type of sugar-coating of a very real problem. She begins by suggesting that there is no evidence to support the students’ claims that the University decisions regarding “students coping with mental health issues” are “motivated by concerns about liability and reputation.” I must admit that I find the lawsuits, letters and other evidence students have brought forth more convincing than Cherrey’s “personal experience” about whether “these concerns [of liability and reputation] were even mentioned.” The fact that Cherrey is even taking such a contrived and manufactured position in itself indicates a serious problem with the administration of our mental health services and the University’s concern for its reputation. Cherrey’s letter concedes nothing, but rather attempts to bolster the perception of how well the University handles mental health cases. Moreover, the fact that “each case is carefully assessed on its own merits and with broad consultation” tells students nothing about how the individual’s personal desires are considered, which is a main concern of the students. No one has been suggesting others are not brought into the conversation at all. Rather, people have been questioning to what extent the student is provided fair options. The letter does not even address the latest round of complaints that the school is insisting a student waive his doctor-patient confidentiality in order to be readmitted. Cherrey’s statement fails to directly address the real issues and instead highlights policies no one has huge qualms about in general. I understand the University has an interest in maintaining its image and does not wish to be dragged into an open public discussion on these tough issues. I also recognize that administrators are limited in what they can say about specific cases due to privacy issues. Nevertheless, I think this open conversation is needed and that students and the Princeton community at large will respect the University for being open to meaningful discussion and making real changes than they do for these patronizing attempts at mitigating the debate. I also recognize that Cherrey has an interest in promoting our mental health services so that negative articles do not prevent students who can be helped from seeking that help. I think it is great that letters to the editor like that of Dr. Calvin Chin, director of Counseling and Psychological Services, highlight these great services. But Chin and Cherrey can promote what CPS is doing well while admitting that there are other policies that need major reconsideration and reworking. It’s great to highlight that decisions to take time off are “almost always made on a voluntary basis.” But I want the administration, and those at other schools facing similar mental health concerns from students, to recognize what the student body is concerned about are the perhaps minority of cases where this is not true. As warmed as I am by reading that Vice President Cherrey wants “our students to succeed,” I want concessions from the University recognizing that the current policies are not perfect. I want substantive evidence that the University is working with students toward concrete changes to existing policies that seem less than just. If the University thinks letters to the editor like those from Chin and Cherrey are going to solve the problem or silence students, they are sadly misinformed. Students don’t want to be treated like fools who would read these letters and assume all is well. It’s time for the University administration to truly address the very real concerns the student body has regarding mental health.  |~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C.

64053|~|On fear and CPS|~|   April 27 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|As a columnist for The Daily Princetonian, I pay more attention than most to these pages. Knowing that, and having heard the horror stories over the last month regarding Counseling and Psychological Services and the administration’s treatment of mental health, you might be surprised at where I was last Tuesday morning. But then, it should not be surprising to find any given Princeton undergrad in the CPS waiting room, especially this time of year. Despite the newly blue skies and the flowers spring brings, moods grow darker as thesis deadlines, final assignments and summer changes approach. I was not the only student in the silent waiting room. I sought counseling for a specific problem: For months, I’ve struggled to prevent myself from wasting incredible amounts of time online. You’re probably thinking what I thought: “Oh, that’s something everyone does, you’ll figure out how to manage it.” And for a while I did. I couldn’t stop myself, whether through willpower or artificial restrictions, and I was irreparably damaging my ability to focus and engage with my friends after sleepless nights. I could not face this alone, so I sought and received help. I was not concerned some administrator would declare my browsing dangerous and force me to withdraw. But I feared the negative press surrounding CPS. Because there’s no stigma associated with compulsive internet use, I can speak openly about it in CPS and in this column. But imagine struggling with depression. Here, the pressure to think “everyone feels down sometimes, you’ll figure out how to manage it” is combined with a justifiable fear of the administrative consequences of a visit to CPS Students have begun to fear the third floor of McCosh Health Center for reasons beyond the difficulty of admitting they need help — a task hard enough for the high-achieving and independent students here. A few days later, I met Dr. Calvin Chin, the new director of CPS, at a dinner discussion sponsored by the Asian-American Students Association on why Asian and Asian-American students seek mental health care in far smaller numbers. We talked about the importance of de-stigmatizing mental health care by talking about it with the community — whether it be the Asian-American community we were addressing in particular, or smaller communities such as teams, eating clubs or academic departments. But more than community, we need reassurance from those in whom we confide. To CPS and administration: We want to trust you. I truly believe that every administrator has students’ best interests at heart, but we are adults and deserve to be treated as such. This means making it absolutely clear when and to what extent confidentiality may be breached. This needs to be clear from the moment students enter CPS, when students make the decision to withdraw, and throughout any readmission process. It cannot be limited to general “release of medical information” — we deserve to know exactly what information will be shared, or we will live in fear of discussing anything. Frank communication between off-campus and on-campus mental health professionals is indisputably necessary for care, and it is inexcusable that any student should be scared of speaking openly with a mental health professional. To students: If you have been to CPS, like 19 percent of students in a given year and double that in their four years, please discuss it with your friends. It is imperative that we have frank conversations regarding the full spectrum of experiences at CPS, from the professional and empathetic care that many have received to the unacceptable experiences of a few students. Cameron Langford wrote two weeks ago how helpful this discourse can be in helping ourselves and those close to us seek needed help, but a culture of conversation about CPS is also the first step to finding and fixing broken norms and practices. Be honest even about your daily stress level: Bragging about all-nighters and facing stress with a fake smile encourage deception and discourage others from reaching out with serious problems. If you haven’t been to CPS, do not be afraid of seeking help. “It pains me,” Dr. Chin said, “that people don’t think they can come in because they’re going to be kicked out!” That anyone should be afraid to find help is the worst outcome of this all. Every member of CPS is there to help you, the student. To pre-frosh here for Preview: These problems plague all institutions, to some extent. Whether you choose Princeton or elsewhere, strive for strong and mutually supportive friendships in your first months away from home. Utilize all your avenues for support — friends, family and medical — and strengthen them through open discussion and willingness to grapple with unjust stigmas or policies. Students have aired their concerns, and Dr. Chin and others have stated they are open for discussion. We can fix this, but only when administrators do sincere work to restore trust in CPS and students meet these efforts with a willingness to seek help and openness about their experiences afterwards. Dr. Chin noted that 12 percent of college students nationally will engage in self-harm. More will suffer depression, intolerable stress and all manner of other ailments. As long as even one of them fears seeking help from University resources we, as a community, have failed them.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a chemistry major from Littleton, Colo.

63749|~|Rejecting and maintaining tradition|~|   April 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|On Easter morning, I awoke to a text from my grandmother. In the message, she expressed her wish that I attend a church service, as it is my family’s tradition. Of course, my grandmother has no knowledge of my religious vacillations. I stared at the text for a few moments, deciding whether to respond with a half-hearted fib, saying that I would go to the University Chapel. But as I have rarely found the courage to lie to my relatives, I chose not to answer at all. This concern for my spiritual welfare is not confined only to the elders in my family. Most relatives on both my mother and father’s side desire that I maintain daily Christian practices. When I told one relative that I had been reading the Bible, I didn’t have the heart to say it was for class. Even though I presently identify as agnostic, Christianity is valuable to me inasmuch as it is a family tradition. Religion has always been a cornerstone of my life, whether or not I choose to accept it. This sets the stage for an internal conflict that intensified after I came to Princeton: I wanted the freedom to articulate and accept my agnosticism while still holding on to the very religious upbringing I claimed to be disowning. Granted, I laud Princeton for its religious diversity, and I think it makes for a more dynamic, educated student body. Yet even so, I’ve found that the personal independence that college affords sometimes endangers a family tradition that has provided a sense of stability and continuity for most of my life. This is certainly no offensive against student autonomy. One of the things that excited me most about the college experience was having the opportunity to step out of the mold that my family has conformed to for generations. During a recent interview that I had (next door to the Office of Religious Life, coincidentally), a Princeton alumnus asked me whether I had thought about exploring any faiths other than Christianity. Though the suggestion intimidated me (I can’t imagine how my grandparents would have responded if they had known I was having that conversation), I felt a surge of excitement. This was how they had advertised college, right? A place for defining yourself on your own terms? But as the year has progressed, and as I’ve lost touch with my religious upbringing, I’ve been surprised to feel a strange combination of pride, nostalgia and fear. Though I boast of self-determination, I often look with regret on what has become of my religious heritage. Because I am clearly not perpetuating the tradition that my family upholds, I feel that I have in some sense undermined what my family has done for me. While I ultimately subscribe to the motto “Do what’s best for yourself,” life cannot be so easily simplified. My relatives have always given me what I need out of love, but I also suspect that this love is derived from the same religious sensibility they hoped I would sustain. With the freedom to define myself comes fear. Sometimes, I wonder whether my choices are the “correct” ones. I ask myself, “What if my family is right, and I am merely in a defective phase disguised as self-discovery?” After all, these are the same people who raised me and always seemed to know the best course of action. Would it be far-fetched to imagine that their tradition prevails over my personal choice? Often the autonomy of college life (positively) connotes the maturation of responsibility and the nascent stages of financial independence among other things. And I agree that these are necessary steps toward a stable and pragmatic adulthood. But because our college years are interpreted as a time of unbridled opportunity, it becomes easier to veer away from the sense of stability one might have acquired at home. This is not, I think, a simple case of feeling homesick or unprepared to face the challenges of the world beyond the gates of our campus. I would imagine that most of us still rely on our families for some type of assistance, whether financial or otherwise. Rather, my fear of abandoning my family’s religious practices extends into a broader discussion of freedom vis-à-vis custom. I love feeling that I can explore my faith, race or morals without the surveillance of my relatives. But there still exists an anxiety that says, at some point, self-exploration not only dishonors the moral conventions that my family upholds, but may also lead to critical life choices whose consequences endanger my happiness. For some people, it is easier to go against their family’s customs than it is for others, and that is fine. In my case, I find myself in between two extremes. I don’t ingratiate myself with my elders, but I am not prepared to say that I am my own sovereign. College is — and should be — an environment that allows us to begin working through personal dilemmas such as this one. I do not always know if my own decisions will benefit me, but if I fall, I suppose it is best that I fell on my own accord.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich.

63793|~|Letter to the Editor: April 24, 2014|~|   April 24 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Mental Health Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|To the Editor, The University’s Counseling and Psychological Services has received a great deal of attention in recent weeks, so I’d like to take this opportunity to describe the services and the high level of care we provide to students. I also want to encourage all students to make full use of our services whenever they need them. Hundreds of students are seen at CPS every year. Most years we see about 19 percent of all graduate and undergraduate students for reasons that range from stress after a breakup to overwhelming anxiety or major depression. In each instance, CPS strives to treat and support students so they can stay in school and thrive, and virtually all do remain on campus and continue with their studies. CPS takes Princeton’s learning mission very seriously. We actively partner with students to avoid or minimize the need for withdrawal from campus and to provide support as they resume their academic activities. Our work is centered around treating and supporting students so they can stay in school. Even in cases where a student needs a higher level of care, such as inpatient hospitalization, many students are able to return to campus, transition to the infirmary service of University Health Services and then resume their studies. In such instances, CPS staff work closely with the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students and the Graduate School to figure out the right algorithm of student support, which may include a reduced course load, extensions on assignments and a care plan that supports the student’s resumption of studies. Students take a leave of absence for a variety of reasons such as wanting to pursue an off-campus opportunity to needing to address a medical condition. Students sometimes elect to take a leave of absence for mental health reasons. Such decisions are almost always made on a voluntary basis, and the students use the break to get well without the pressure of academic work. At CPS we are constantly looking for new ways to make our services more accessible through initiatives like our mindfulness-based stress-reduction workshops and our new CPS Wellness Outpost in the Engineering Quadrangle. We want students to know that they don’t need to suffer alone, that everyone struggles on occasion and that it’s okay to ask for help. We’re here to help students stay in school and to have the best possible experience while they’re here. If students have any concerns about CPS and how we work with students, I hope they will call, write or make an appointment to speak with me or UHS Executive Director John Kolligian. It’s important to us that your questions and concerns are addressed, and we will do everything we can to address them as fully as we can. Calvin R.

63781|~|Editorial: Investigating gender pay discrepancy at Princeton            |~|   April 24 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Recently, the American Association of University Professors released its 2013-2014 Faculty Salary Survey. The survey investigated “trends, gender breakdowns, and comparisons of faculty salaries” at over 1000 colleges and universities. The survey found that while on the whole, Princeton pays its full professors more than most institutions, the average pay of female professors is just 89.9 percent of their male counterparts. This statistic parallels a similar discrepancy that pervades nearly all careers at the national level. This national gender pay gap was recently addressed by the Obama Administration with two executive orders meant to improve transparency of pay at federal contractors and businesses. While the discrepancy at Princeton may not be the result of intentional discrimination, the Board believes that the University should investigate the source of this difference and ensure that equal pay is given in return for equal work. The difference between male and female professor salaries could be a due to a variety of factors. Historically, academia has been dominated by men. For this reason, it may be the case that a greater proportion of male faculty members have greater seniority, and so, receive more pay on the whole than female faculty members. It is also plausible that fewer women pursue professorships than men, and the 89.9 percent figure may reflect this confounding variable as well.  Furthermore, the average faculty pay was not broken down into discipline-based averages – if male professors dominate highly paid fields, then the 89.9 percent figure might represent skewed representation in these departments. With only the knowledge of the average pay discrepancy across the board, it is impossible to know exactly whether or not — or to what degree — these confounding variables account for the 89.9 percent statistic. The Board urges the University to investigate the pay difference with attention to the above factors. While the administration has started to take steps to improve faculty diversity, the Board believes that an investigation of faculty pay might reveal policy changes that could improve the discrepancy. In September 2013, the University released the Report of the Trustee Ad Hoc Committee on Diversity, a report that discussed the state of diversity at Princeton. The Board commends many of the recommendations the Committee made, including new methods to identify rising stars from underrepresented groups as well as greater support systems to retain early-career, tenure-track faculty. It is possible that improved hiring and retention of female professors could, in time, limit the impact of the higher salaries of older male professors on pay averages. However, the Board believes that more specific recommendations could be made to address the issue of pay discrepancy following a University-led investigation. Many of the Committee’s recommendations were issued with the broad goal of increasing diversity in the ranks of the faculty. Targeted policy is required if the University aims to ensure pay equality for its professors. The Board believes that the pay discrepancy between male and female faculty members must be investigated and subsequently addressed with specific reforms if necessary. The pay difference may be the result of variety of factors, and only closer examination of pay data can reveal the underlying causes behind the broad 89.9 percent statistic. The AAUP report found pay discrepancies at several of our peer institutions, and the Board believes that Princeton should take the lead in addressing the report’s findings. While factors outside the University’s control will inevitably continue to affect the composition of our faculty, the University should continue to consider various avenues by which it can ensure that faculty pay is fair.|~|

63591|~|“Heartbleed? That’s the thing where I’m supposed to change my password, right?”|~|   April 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|On April 1, Google notified workers at OpenSSL that they had discovered Heartbleed, an online bug that caused a fatal flaw in OpenSSL that left many users’ data vulnerable. OpenSSL is a tool used for data encryption by major websites such as Google, Yahoo, and Amazon. While bugs are commonplace on the web, Heartbleed leaves the backdoor to your private information wide open. Unlike a coding mistake that may mess up how a website is displayed or not loading a website properly, this bug gives hackers the ability to literally eavesdrop and monitor all information between users and web services. This creates a giant liability for many users, who use these services on a daily, almost constant basis. Although smaller bugs may be easier to dismiss, OpenSSL is prominently used throughout the web; the compromise of OpenSSL has left almost no user untouched. In response, the Office of Information Technology, on Friday, sent an email “strongly encourag[ing]” students to change their passwords. Although sent to all Princeton email users, it appears that the email was not enough. Many students asked either ignored the email, keeping their password the same, or at most, changed their login information on a few other major websites that were supposedly affected. Granted, something is better than nothing. Nonetheless, this is a flawed and irresponsible approach. In an age where we blindly trust technology to be impervious and our data to be secure, many students will not be self-motivated to change their passwords themselves, especially when they truly do not appreciate the depth of this breach. While one obviously hopes that students would be responsible and take the initiative themselves, we must face the fact that many will not. Despite the surprising extent of technology in our everyday lives, the majority of users are tech-illiterate. Many do not realize that behind its appearance as a flawless monolith, the Internet is comprised of millions of lines of code, where one faulty line written by an inattentive programmer can have huge consequences. Only by forcing students to change their passwords will the importance of changing our passwords be signified to the student body. This is especially pertinent, seeing as the majority of Princeton students access their mail through Gmail, one of the compromised web services, which became the school’s default mail client two years ago. Additionally, users might not change their passwords to every other site where the username or password is the same, which is also problematic. While certain sites may have been protected, hackers, if they acquired your information from a compromised site and if you use that same password/username on the protected site, will be able to access your accounts there as well. I, and I am certain many of my fellow students, am guilty of using the same password for multiple sites. Passwords obtained could be used to compromise people’s banking, tax or insurance accounts, creating room for a wide range of headaches and financial woe. And this is a real problem. It only took 24 hours after disclosure for hackers to try to use the exploit against a major company, successfully using the flaw, and this is just out of the cases known. There are potentially many other compromises still unknown on companies that contain the user information of millions. Princeton had the perfect opportunity to fix this with the recent process of class registration for the upcoming term. By requiring students to change their passwords to register for classes, a required activity for all students who will be attending in the fall, each student will be able to, at the very least, protect their Princeton account, which has access to finances, email, and other important services. The lack of response reflects a larger flaw, not only among our student body, but societally, as we have formed a technological apathy to the plethora of problems that exist. While we constantly hear about these bugs and flaws in all of the technology that surrounds, we rarely are ever plagued by the consequences of it. When credit card information is obtained through a phishing scam or because the user information was compromised, the first reactions of many are to cancel the card, and while they may understand that something went wrong they have little idea of the exact details or even worse, how to prevent it in the future. Regardless of the University’s response, this should be an opportunity for students to educate themselves, given how important our user information is and living in an age where we keep so much on the web. By learning of the potential magnitude of the problem and the ability to take easy, yet very strong, preventative steps, we can all go a great way to making our information safer. On that note, I stress each student to change their password as soon as possible. Mashable recently posted a list of known sites where information may have been compromised, showing whether your password should be changed. With so much on the line, it is simply not worth the risk to stand by and hope for the best.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu. 
63598|~|Nothing left to say|~|   April 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|It’s a trend that I initially started to realize during the middle of first semester, and as time went on, it became more apparent to me. Maybe it’s because we are all in the confines of the hallowed and respected institution of Princeton, where students have for past two hundred or so years have traversed these ancient halls in the pursuit of academic excellence and intellectual invigoration. Maybe it’s simply the effect of being around so many smart people. But regardless of the reason, everywhere on campus – at the mahogany tables in the dining halls, at the plushy recliners in Frist, even in the restrooms – more often than not, the interactions and discussions between people tend to involve some intellectual strain of thought, some element of academia. Don’t get me wrong – there’s nothing wrong with having an interesting discussion with friends about academic matters. After all, one of the best ways to develop thoughts is to bounce ideas off others, to get their criticism and feedback, in turn allowing someone to refine an argument or solidify a nascent fledgling spark of an idea into a cohesive one But at the same time, it seems that the need to think “big thoughts” might be a little too omnipresent, and in its omnipresence, can even be stifling and repressive. After all, when you try to attach significance to every little thing, some of the fun is inevitably lost. While Game of Thrones may be an addicting pastime, it becomes difficult not to ponder questions of sociopolitical stratification, moral corruption, and other grandiose issues (take your pick – there are lots to chose from) without taking some of the fun out of the blood, sex, and drama of the show. Why might such a recursive tendency to search for greater meaning arise in the first place? Part of the reason might be that we inevitably carry over the themes and topics we learn in class to our everyday lives. At the same time, a general belief that education should extend “beyond the classroom” likely contributes to this as well. We are taught that the material we learn should serve as merely a basis for a broader intellectual scope, and that, outside of class time, we should strive to be “thinkers” in our own right. There’s nothing wrong, of course, with applying greater considerations to daily life occurrences and with trying to draw significance from them. But it does seem that this trend can extend too far. Even when I was trying to come up with a topic to write about for a column, I initially began by seeking out provocative issues facing Princeton students on campus, problems that require consideration and discussion, but found that I was having difficulty identifying one. This made me question whether the academically focused atmosphere at Princeton might actually be stifling for simple musing and whimsical thought. I was reminded of a discussion I had, just a few days ago, about a thoroughly trivial topic – something about boba pearls vs. fruit filled boba (which are apparently called frooba; who knew?). The discussion came during a jaunt to Fruity Yogurt, naturally, and despite its completely trifling subject matter, I found it to be a refreshing change of pace. No mention was made of the dialectical differences between the vernacular for “tapioca pearls” between the east and west coast, nothing was said about the economic implications of the recent boom in frozen yogurt as a substitute to ice cream. Though it may seem obvious, it is nice to let go and think “silly” thoughts at times. It’s ok that not everything you say or do has particular significance. However, on a campus like Princeton, where academics is such an overarching component of daily life, it is sometimes all to easy to forget this simple fact. Recently, I saw a group of students flipping through a couple pieces of student-produced literature (among them the Daily Prince and the Nassau weekly), only to comment on how all the articles were “meaningless and stupid.” But isn’t that sometimes the point? Stepping outside the world of academic considerations can of course be de-stressing, and it also fosters mental relaxation. So don’t always feel obliged to perpetually think on a macro-level, cosmic scale. It’s ok to have nothing left to say, or at least nothing particularly insightful.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. He can be reached at jasonjc@princeton.edu. 
63564|~|The problem with dress codes|~|   April 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|The internet has been buzzing recently with the controversy regarding a middle school in Evanston, Ill. that imposed a set of addendums to its dress code. The new policy bans girls from wearing leggings and yoga pants because such tight-fitting clothes are “too distracting” to their male peers. The girls, in retaliation, picketed their school, claiming that the administration was “slut shaming.” At most schools without uniforms, dress codes have been in place for decades at most schools without uniforms, but there’s a very noticeable disparity among the kinds of clothes disallowed for boys and the kinds of clothes disallowed for girls. There’s no national standard, but a quick Googling of the greater Princeton area’s various high school dress codes provided the following general outlines for all students: no bare backs, no spaghetti strap tops, no exposed stomachs, no short shorts, no short dresses/skirts and no drug/gang-related paraphernalia. Save for the very last one, all the above guidelines are meant to police girls, rather than boys. If the idea is to prevent students from distracting other students in a sexual way, then shouldn’t boys be prevented from wearing sleeveless or tight shirts, lest their biceps or toned musculature prevent a girl (or boy) from finishing her history test in a timely manner? Shouldn’t boys be prevented from wearing skinny jeans because they — in the same vein as yoga pants — leave too little to the hormonal teenage imagination? The thing is, women are policed so that they are no longer distracting to men, while men, if policed at all, are never told to change for the benefit of the opposite sex. The most prominent example that comes to mind when thinking of male-specific supplements to dress codes relates to sagging pants, an urban trend where pants are worn low to expose many inches worth of boxers. Efforts to ban these practices have never once mentioned how visible boxers would tortuously distract nearby females. Rather, they focus on visible underwear being inappropriate for a learning or work environment. The rationale behind certain points in a dress code might not seem as important compared to the ultimate result of what is and what isn’t allowed. However, the very idea that women’s bodies are innately sexual — even as 12- or 13-year-old middle school students — is what sets the stage for rape culture and slut shaming later on in life.  The dress code policy implies that these young, barely pubescent girls are tempting their male peers by simply standing around in tight clothing. It reaffirms the stale ideal that men are born lecherous and unable to control themselves. Not only that, but it presents this supposed inherent male characteristic as okay. What needs to change, according to these dress codes, isn’t the male gaze, but rather the women upon whom the male gaze falls. This isn’t too far a throw from the tenets of rape culture, which dictate that rape is the fault of the victim, that short skirts and vampy makeup open the door for sexual assault at no fault of the rapist. Problematic lines of thinking are reinforced and compound into larger problems when they are seeded at such an early age. There’s a relatively quick fix, though: phrase dress codes so that they don’t seem to prize the protection of the sensitive male libido over the objectification of women’s bodies. It’s a long shot to suggest that middle school administrations allow girls to wear whatever they want. Though it would allow girls autonomy over their own bodies, it’s highly impractical.  There are things inappropriate to wear in a learning environment, just as there are things inappropriate to wear to a job in a laboratory or to an interview on Wall Street or to a beach wedding. Rather, changing the phrasing of these dress codes to reflect the environment rather than the male members of it would solve a large part of the problem. The idea is to stop portraying girls and their bodies as innately sexual, especially at such a young age.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

63361|~|Letter to the Editor: April 23, 2014|~|   April 22 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Mental Health Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|To the Editor: Several recent op-eds in The Daily Princetonian have erroneously asserted that when the University makes decisions regarding students coping with mental health issues, it is motivated by concerns about liability and reputation. No evidence is offered to support this claim, and I can say from personal experience that it is simply not true. I cannot remember a single case when these concerns were even mentioned. The fact is that decisions are based entirely on two considerations: what is in the best interest of the student and what is in the best interest of the other residents of this campus community. When the decision involves a withdrawal or a return to campus, each case is carefully assessed on its own merits and with broad consultation across all the offices that can contribute to an informed and thoughtful judgment. These offices can include the deans of the college and student life, the residential college staffs, University Health Services and Counseling and Psychological Services, among others; if a graduate student, the Graduate School deans and staff can be included as well. We consult as fully as we can with the student’s doctors and family members, in each case trying to learn as much as possible about any risks the student may present to him or herself or to others in the community. We want our students to succeed. But we also want them to be safe. When a student is under the care of an outside physician or other health professional, we want to learn whatever that person can tell us, but we cannot delegate the decision about whether to encourage a student to leave or whether to permit a student to return solely to that person, to the student or to the student’s family. We have a responsibility to make our own assessment on behalf of the University based on all of the evidence available to us and to protect as fully as possible the health and well-being of all members of the campus community. When a student is returning, we also have a responsibility to make sure appropriate support is in place so that the student has every chance to return successfully and to thrive. These are responsibilities we take very seriously, and we carry them out in a manner that respects the specific circumstances of each individual and each situation, even if, because of privacy reasons, we cannot discuss those circumstances with the press.

63381|~|AP credits should fulfill distribution requirements|~|   April 22 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|When the time comes to pick classes at the end of each semester, we all find ourselves going through some stage of the same basic process: We consider how we’re going to fill our distribution requirements, what prerequisites or departmentals we need, which classes fill another class’s prereqs or how we’ll take classes around our independent work. Inevitably, the process becomes even more complicated when we factor in the afterthought of which classes we’d really like to take, which ones have the best professors or which ones have the most interesting topics. I believe that currently, the University’s distribution requirements — while much less restrictive than those of other schools — are still unnecessarily restrictive and that by eliminating or reducing some regulations concerning these requirements, Princeton can better achieve its goals. The goal of fostering a comprehensive liberal arts education is both understandable and laudable. One of the things that most distinguishes the American higher education system from that of the U.K., Canada or other countries is that at the undergraduate level, one can take courses in a variety of disciplines. Because of the 12-course rule, which mandates that no more than 12 courses can be taken in a given department, we can (and are required to) take classes completely unrelated to our major even after we’ve declared it. There are myriad reasons why such diversity of exposure is beneficial to one’s education, and they need not be rehashed here. Suffice it to say that by expanding our horizons, we create well-rounded learners who can apply their knowledge to the interdisciplinary problems of the modern world. While in principle I fully support the distribution requirements’ goal of furthering such academic exploration, I think that the quantity and specificity of the distribution requirements are of such a degree at present as to, in fact, work contrary to that goal. First, by designating how and what we are to explore, the distribution requirements overstep the bounds of such exploratory encouragement. Whereas the 12-course rule directly leads to exploration by forcing us outside of our departments (a negative obligation, in a sense), the distribution requirements tell us what to do with those free classes (a positive obligation). This directly contradicts the freedom to explore that which Princeton wishes to espouse. Promoting well-rounded students — instead of just allowing students freedom in course selection — by forcing them to take certain distribution requirement classes makes sense, as these two goals don’t necessarily overlap. But I believe that by expanding the AP credit acceptance policy, Princeton can increase the freedom students have in course selection without significantly hurting its efforts to create a well-rounded student body. This is not to say that there should be no distribution requirements at all, however. It seems logical and necessary that in the 21st century all college graduates should have some experience with science and lab work, some exposure to literature and the arts and some exposure to math, for instance. The (true) idea that a well-rounded 21st century college graduate ought be exposed to a wide array of subjects is not mutually exclusive with also allowing students freedom in choosing their course loads (beyond major and certificate requirements). For instance, it is true that all students should have some experience with literature and the arts, but it seems flawed to assume that a 5 on AP Lit doesn’t in any way fulfill an experience similar to taking a Literature and the Arts course. The main counterargument here is that the University already allows for a great degree of exploration and that the distribution requirements are there to promote well-roundedness instead of exploration. To this, however, it seems necessary to clarify that I’m not saying we don’t get enough exploration; rather, that by allowing for greater freedom in passing out of distribution requirements through AP and similar credits, we can have a student body that is both well-rounded academically and has yet more freedom to explore. The similar experiences, for example, of AP World History and HIS 201: History of the World Since 1300 should be recognized. Someone who does well on AP World History has, according to the original reason for the creation of APs (to allow advanced high school students to take college-level courses), received an at least roughly equivalent experience of an introductory Historical Analysis requirement class. Therefore, by allowing that student to pass out of one of his HAs and thus take any class he wants, the University allows its student body even more freedom in choosing classes without limiting the academic well-roundedness it rightly seeks to create. By allowing greater academic exploration without significantly diminishing the quality of the well-rounded liberal arts education Princeton seeks to instill in students, the increased use of AP and other credits to fulfill distribution requirements will be beneficial to the entire student body, regardless of degree program or academic discipline.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

63375|~|Lawnparties: Quality or quantity?|~|   April 22 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|This spring, we Princetonians are experiencing what has been called “easily the worst lineup of all the Ivies.” I am referring, of course, to USG’s disappointing decision to subject us to GRiZ and Mayer Hawthorne this Lawnparties. Picking two acts who are generally unknown to the Princeton population is bad enough, and that decision was made even worse by the April Fool’s joke that preceded it. On April 1, all Princeton students received a USG email telling us that this year’s Lawnparties headliners would be JoJo and Nickelback. Perhaps this was never the intent of the joke, but excitement was instantaneous. I don’t think that they accounted for the fact that JoJo was the soundtrack to many a Princetonian’s life back in middle school. And the fact that she hasn’t released anything recently made her just washed-up enough to be plausible (hello, Aaron Carter!). I can’t speak for everyone, but I know that I, along with many of my friends, was already picturing myself singing along to “Leave (Get Out)” and “Too Little, Too Late” minutes after the email was sent out. Even Nickelback, the Internet’s most hated band, would be preferable to the acts who were eventually announced; we know them, at least, and we have heard their songs on the radio. But GRiZ and Mayer Hawthorne? Come on, GRiZ doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page, and Mayer Hawthorne plays sleepy soul music, which hardly seems appropriate for the Lawnparties atmosphere. So instead of an exciting afternoon belting out throwback songs from middle school, we will either be staring at a virtually unknown producer or falling asleep in front of some soul singer. The contrast between our potential Lawnparties and the actual event is extremely strong and disappointing. These acts would have been unsatisfactory in any case because of the infinitely superior acts at our fellow Ivy League schools. For example, Harvard will have Janelle Monáe, and Columbia will have Lupe Fiasco. USG should have realized that Princetonians would not exactly be pleased with the choices, especially in the face of such competition. Therefore, USG should have done everything in its power to mitigate the inevitable discontent. I am not necessarily blaming it for choosing such unknown musicians because it is clear that they were the best we could afford. As USG social chair Logan Roth ’15 told The Daily Princetonian directly after the announcement was made, “The best part, of course, is that they fit into our budget, that they’re available and that they’re down to come and play.” With this kind of rousing endorsement from the very guy who booked the acts, the larger Princeton community cannot have been expected to be excited about Lawnparties. However, his quote also makes it obvious why they were picked; anyone we would have actually heard of would be too expensive or wouldn’t care to come. Perhaps the problem is that we have two concerts whereas most schools only have one in the spring. Take Harvard, for example. It spends the entire year’s concert budget on one performance in the spring, Yardfest. Harvard also cuts costs by having student bands open for the main act, Janelle Monáe. These cost-cutting measures are probably what allowed the school to hire an established and popular musician. The question for Princetonians then becomes: Which would we prefer? Do we want to keep Lawnparties as a biannual event with the risk that the acts hired will then be substandard, or would we prefer one big, blow-out event? Do we need two headliners, or could we settle for one? If the money spent booking GRiZ and Mayer Hawthorne were combined, then perhaps we could have gotten one musician who was greater than the sum of their parts. Of course, this means we might have to settle for an amateur opener, the way Harvard did with its student bands. However, I think the payoff of having one larger, more crowd-pleasing act would be worth such a small sacrifice. Of course, here at Princeton, we have a secret weapon that has no counterpart at Harvard: the eating clubs. Since, traditionally, the eating clubs also organize acts during Lawnparties, perhaps they could join forces to host one act that would please the student population. The main issue with Lawnparties is we need to develop an attitude of quality over quantity. Whether we reduce the number of Lawnparties in the year or the number of performers at each Lawnparties, we need to scale something down. With this new focus on less is more, we should be able to afford people who would really get us excited. Who knows, maybe we could even get JoJo.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a freshman from Fairfax, Va.

63179|~|Missing the point|~|   April 21 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“South Korea is a culture that prizes obeying your superiors,” CNN correspondent Kyung Lah stated in her coverage of the now capsized South Korean ferry. More than 450 passengers, many of them teenage students on a high school field trip, were aboard a ferry when it tipped over and began to sink off the South Korean coast on Wednesday, April 16, 2014. According to reports, the ferry’s captain Lee Joon-seok ordered passengers to remain seated for their own safety. Many of the passengers who complied are now trapped underwater. Amid the media frenzy surrounding the disaster and the controversy of the captain’s actions, Lah points out a supposed cultural idiosyncrasy to explain why students heeded orders to stay put instead of attempting to escape the sinking vessel. In doing so, she inadvertently makes it seem as though victims are at fault for obeying misguided instructions and that a hierarchical culture vis-à-vis Confucianism is to blame for their erroneous judgment. However, a tragedy such as this one cannot be boiled down to explanations of cultural behavior. Looking to authority figures for guidance in times of danger is not a stereotypically “South Korean” act — it is what most people would do. Regardless of upbringing or background, it is natural for people to trust that those in positions of authority or expertise have a better grasp of an uncertain situation, such as when students here at Princeton remained indoors and looked to Princeton Alert updates for the all-clear after reports of gunshots at Nassau Hall surfaced. Passengers justly believed that the captain and his crew understood proper emergency protocol and knew what was best. The tragedy lies in the miscalculated order itself, not in the act of heeding it. The multifaceted tragedy of the Sewol ferry’s sinking is not yet completely understood, nor will it ever be. New developments in investigations continue to surface even as the rescue operation continues on in the face of disastrous weather and horrible water conditions. To reach for something as indeterminate and elusive as culture to explain what is a very real and hurtful — and ongoing — tragedy is poor reporting on Lah’s part. Though some would choose to target Lah’s personal background as a South Korean when evaluating her coverage of the accident, I would rather focus on her identity as a representative of American press covering a foreign event. When addressing a tragedy that has occurred in another country, it is all too easy for U.S. national media to strip the story down to more palatable elements for the sake of their viewers. It is easier to say, “This is how things are over there,” than to spend precious on-air time explaining the details of a particular event. The story becomes more sensational when one can make a sweeping statement about a country’s culture that gives an all-too-easy explanation for how such a disaster could have come to be. This is not to say that there is no merit in studying culture or that cultural differences do not exist. But there are ways to study culture that account for its vast complexities. For example, the East Asian Studies Department at the University strives to move away from the Orientalist tendency to essentialize and arbitrarily categorize what Edward Said calls the “other” in his book Orientalism, instead encouraging students to explore holistically “the culture, history, societies, politics and languages of East Asia (China, Japan and Korea).” However, it is disrespectful and unfair to the victims of this tragedy to use an over-generalized point-blank statement to explain the decision made by people in extreme and devastating circumstances. In the end, however, what matters most — in fact, the only thing that truly matters — is that there may still be potential survivors trapped in air pockets underwater, that families are waiting desperately to be reunited with their loved ones and that as world citizens, we must support them and those working tirelessly in search-and-rescue operations. The rest — understanding what happened and why — can, and should, wait.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan. She can be reached at ljkim@princeton.edu. 
63214|~|#selfie|~|   April 21 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|Millennials have been called the “me generation,” and if you were to search “selfie” on any form of social media, the claim seems well-founded. We’re a generation obsessed with looking good and letting people know that we look good. Got a new haircut? Selfie. Wearing a new shade of lipstick? Selfie. Dressed up for a formal? Selfie. It is often overlooked, however, that millennials fall into two camps when it comes to solo selfies. The first camp takes selfies and posts them online. The other is annoyed by the first. Until recently, I happened to fall into the second. In doing so, I was a hypocrite. I am embarrassed to admit that despite my professed opposition to what I found a vain practice, I myself have taken my fair share of secret selfies (the mirror selfie, the Photo Booth selfie, the iPhone selfie and so on) simply because I felt attractive on a given day. But there is a stigma against finding yourself beautiful that prevents me from ever sharing, verbally or implicitly via selfie, the sentiment. If I post anything of myself, I will justify it as an “ironic” selfie or a “shameless” selfie as if to ward off those who will be inevitably inclined to judge as so many are. However, I am beginning to think that the love-hate relationship our generation has with the selfie is reflective of a far more toxic issue than simply whether or not it should be socially acceptable to take pictures of yourself. And my concern is not the one that is predominantly raised by older generations that see the selfie as the worst of this “me” revolution. While the serial selfie-ist may raise concerns about vanity and egotism (fair issues in their own right), the selfie doesn’t have to be the mark of superficiality at all, but rather a mode of positive self-expression. We should recognize the inherent issue in judging a selfie, more or less condemning a person for finding him or herself attractive. The solo selfie inherently proclaims, “I think I look good,” and, without crossing a line of course, that shouldn’t be an unacceptable declaration. Countless campaigns and movements have been focused on getting young people to love themselves, to consider themselves beautiful as they are. Yet, when someone makes that declaration, we are quick to cry vanity. Something is very wrong when it becomes more socially acceptable to complain about being fat or ugly (unfounded concerns more often than not) than to call yourself beautiful. There should be nothing embarrassing about taking a picture for no other reason than that feeling good about yourself. That should be something to celebrate and encourage. I am not oblivious to the fact that this is not always the case when it comes to a selfie. I understand that the very act of posting a selfie seems to beg for likes or comments as a form of validation of beauty, rather than a means of expressing self-love. Young people become reliant on others to tell them they’re beautiful rather than believing so ourselves. And it is all too easy with Facebook and Instagram to collect these validations and do so quickly. In this light, the selfie seems more self-conscious than it would appear. Nonetheless, I do believe that not all selfies have to fall to this standard. The selfie for one’s own sake, a declaration of self-confidence, could be a powerful tool for celebrating positive body image. I am not advocating for the “thin” selfie or the highly edited selfie, but rather for the selfie that celebrates one as he or she is, for no reason at all. If I and other “selfie haters” set aside judgment and see the selfie as a consequence of positive self-identity, then it becomes more a mentality to envy than to mock. It should be all right to say, proudly and loudly, “I am beautiful,” and, in turn, it should be all right to post the occasional selfie that professes just that. Though I once upheld the stigma myself, I do believe selfies have the potential to do good by encouraging the truth that we are afraid to say aloud — the fact that there are moments when we should, and hopefully do, look in a mirror and see something beautiful. And this mentality should exist far more often than in selfie-ed moments, but at least the selfie could be a start.|~|Chelsea Jones is an English major from Ridgefield, Conn.

63064|~|Editorial: Implement blind grading |~|   April 21 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Recently, in response to criticism about unfair grading, some courses have implemented a system of blind grading for problem sets and papers. In these courses, students are either required to submit a copy of their paper without a name in addition to a copy with a name or are assigned a number to write in place of a name. In both systems, the professor or preceptor grades the nameless papers and then matches grades to students.  While this policy may be unrealistic for some courses such as seminars and independent work, the Editorial Board supports this trend and encourages more University departments and classes to adopt this policy. Proponents of blind grading note that a variety of factors can influence professors and preceptors to give grades that might not reflect the quality of the paper. In the rush to grade papers quickly, the reputation of the student, the quality of past work or biases about minority groups can act subconsciously to impact grades. When this effect is combined with Princeton’s grade deflation policy, it can be unfairly difficult for some students to do well in their classes. For example, the philosophy department has recently considered adopting this policy in response to research that showed that female students were getting consistently lower grades in philosophy courses.  The Board thinks that this is a positive step towards ending these problems. We also believe that this step reflects our evolving understanding of how discrimination works. Whether it is discrimination in favor of established students who have reputations for doing well or discrimination against certain minority groups, a growing body of work shows that many forms of discrimination often act subconsciously. While much progress has been made at ending deliberate and overt discrimination, there is still a lot of work to do to end the unfairness that subconscious bias can create. Professors and preceptors cannot end behaviors of which they might not be aware. By encouraging more blind grading, the Board thinks one of the main ways unfairness can manifest itself on campus can be eliminated. We do realize that there would be limitations to this policy, which will still not eliminate biases against particular ideas (especially controversial ones in politics or philosophy) or certain approaches to a topic. This policy would also not be effective in smaller classes in which students frequently talk about their papers with the professor or in seminars that require students to produce original research papers. The Board realizes that interaction with professors is an essential part of the process of producing original work and that it would be difficult to implement a blind policy without compromising a critical part of the learning process.  Given this, we think that this policy would only apply to larger classes in which every student writes on a fixed set of topics. In these classes, the similarity of the topics would allow students to discuss their ideas with a professor or preceptor without compromising the system. Furthermore, even though we recognize a perfectly anonymous system is difficult, we still think that a system that makes some progress in disassociating the quality of students’ work from other parts of their identities would be a step in the right direction. There is not one policy that will end unfairness at Princeton. Many aspects of University life serve to reinforce existing advantages and make it difficult for certain students to advance. Whether it is discrimination based on identity or simply favoring more familiar students, unfairness exists both in the classroom and outside of it. However, the Board thinks that implementing this policy would help narrow advantages in course grades.  Every student deserves to have their work evaluated fairly, and this policy would aid in reaching that goal.|~|
62987|~|My lying, smiling face|~|   April 20 2014|~|Columns Mental Health Opinion |~|Anonymous|~|None|~|Editor’s note: The author of this column was granted anonymity due to the intensely personal nature of the events described. I am writing this column because I am genuinely concerned about the well-being of my fellow students here at Princeton. I wish to share my own story, first, to try to push back against our very real and human tendency to prefer silence over any difficult conversation, and second, because I hope to reignite this crucial discussion regarding mental health at Princeton. Surrounding the University’s Mental Health Week last month, a few perspectives and opinions were raised regarding voluntary or involuntary withdrawals and Princeton’s related policies. While it is laudable that efforts were made to promote discussion on this topic, the momentum from that week seemed to stop short of meaningful change. During that time, there surfaced only a couple of articles highlighting students’ concerns, a single article from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students and University Health Services in response, and then … nothing. To clarify up front, I am currently in a year-long leave of absence from the University. In just the first two months of focused treatment, I am already infinitely better and look to the future with hope. But my situation was not always so positive. The first two-and-a-half years of my Princeton career were filled with an ongoing battle with clinical depression. Beginning in my freshman year, I began to suffer the classic symptoms: sadness, lowered energy and self-esteem and a loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy (this occurrence is not uncommon; a great number of individuals who will deal with mental illness begin to experience symptoms in their late teen years). This continued through my sophomore year, and it prompted me to intermittently visit Counseling and Psychological Services and talk to a counselor. I generally had a good experience there, and even wrote a few comments on previous years’ mental health-related articles to reassure concerned and stressed out individuals that not all CPS counselors were the enemy, as many feared. And as long as my condition stayed manageable, I was content using campus resources as part of my mental and emotional support. But then it got worse. Toward the end of the summer and continuing through this past fall semester, my depression became more severe than anything I could have ever imagined. My brain, which was formerly one of my greatest assets, turned against me with a vengeance. I was constantly in a state of inexplicable self-loathing, and if anyone presented “a substantial risk of self-harm,” it was me. Entire lectures would pass by without me hearing a single word the professor said; I had to focus all of my mental energy and effort on not scratching myself with the cap of my pen. My daily commute back to my dorm required that I convince myself not to “accidentally” crash my bike on the steps leading to my entryway. I encountered these types of thoughts and impulses several times an hour, nearly every day of every month, and the severity continued for the entirety of the semester. I regularly saw a counselor off-campus (a privilege that not all students are fortunate to have), but once things got worse I stopped scheduling appointments with CPS; I stopped because I was terrified of the horror stories I had heard. I was scared that Princeton would force me to involuntarily withdraw. I was scared that they would only hear the details that threatened their reputation and liability, and would neglect to consider qualities that my friends and mentors recognized in me — strength, resilience, perseverance and, most importantly, the fact that I had already overcome literally hundreds of dangerous situations in my own head and reached out for help when I knew I shouldn’t attempt to conquer them on my own. In short, I was scared of being labeled, stigmatized and defined by my struggle. Though I was already (very seriously) considering a leave of absence, I was thoroughly convinced that if Princeton knew the truth about me, I would lose all autonomy and the ability to make my decision without overwhelming pressure from the administration. My conclusion? Silence was the only option. During the first of many “check-in” meetings my Director of Student Life requested throughout last semester, she asked me directly, “How is your depression going?” I plastered a smile on my face, told her my depression was “much better, thank you,” then immediately returned to my room to cry. After fall break, with encouragement and support from my family and close friends, I made the choice to take a year off in order to more effectively focus on my treatment and overall health. I was still concerned about losing autonomy, however, and knew that the process would become much more complicated if the University knew the underlying reasons behind my decision. I told those officially involved with my withdrawal that I was leaving for “medical reasons” and they were content to leave the situation ambiguous for a while, until they eventually found out it was for unspecified “mental health” reasons. Then a flurry of evaluations, recommendations and confidentiality waivers ensued mere days before my departure. And the complications only multiplied from there: a month later, via a letter in the mail, I found out that, among a large number of other requirements, it would be “necessary” for me to “sign two copies of the ‘Authorization for Release of Information’ form: one authorizing your treatment providers to discuss your progress with our clinical staff at CPS, and one authorizing CPS to discuss your readmission evaluation with us.” The implications are sobering. If I ever want to return to Princeton as a student, I will have to ‘voluntarily’ waive my right to doctor-patient confidentiality by signing those two forms. To the administration, to ODUS and to the directors of UHS and CPS: I understand that you are concerned for students who find themselves in these difficult situations and that you have to worry about liability issues, but the reality is that mental health’s stigma in our society presents an enormous obstacle that prevents students from reaching out. Please understand that Princeton’s current policies and procedures surrounding mental health and withdrawals do little to alleviate the fears of students who consider seeking help (or not). And though you may believe you have the students’ best interests in mind, you may in fact be contributing to the problem. For example, the rigorous readmission process is counterproductive. It hinders the effectiveness of a student’s treatment while at home — if I know that anything I say during a counseling session might end up on the desks of those who wield the power to potentially reject my return, I will not feel the freedom to be open and honest when it matters. And the policy that apparently allowed you to ban one student from campus until he was forced to withdraw (despite the abundant support of his psychiatrist and professors) is gravely dangerous, because it dissuades those who need help from ever reaching out. These policies might be in place to reduce the University’s risk of liability, but ironically they increase it. The University may seek to protect students from themselves, but in an environment of stigma, it unfortunately sends a message that students in dire need of help must choose between rejection or the isolation of silence. How long will it take before we become the next Penn or Harvard? As long as these concerns remain unaddressed, students will continue to choose silence over seeking assistance. Respectfully, I don’t think that advising students to talk to you if they are fearful of talking to you is going to work. This is circular reasoning and fails to acknowledge the salience of students’ deepest concerns. If you don’t believe me, simply look back at the comments under a March 9 letter to the editor: not a single person felt that their worries were alleviated by the administration’s response. I am hesitant to give any specific policy recommendations to the University; though I have a few ideas, I am not adequately familiar with the intricacies and nuances of mental health policy. But until staff and students work together to find an innovative solution, nothing will change. And change is imperative. It could be a matter of life and death.|~|

62829|~|Empty chairs|~|   April 17 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|When asked about their favorite aspect of Princeton, most students will respond that it’s “the people.” This answer does not surprise me, as it is my answer too. We walk among giants: Our peers publish books, start companies and sing music for movies. But who else walks this campus? Our professors, from Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporters to Nobel Laureates to those who win Academy Awards and Fields Medals. In the routine rush to finish our assignments, sometimes the breadth of the surrounding intellectual force field slips our minds. During a Breakout trip last year, I asked David Super ’80, a professor of law at Georgetown and Princeton alumnus, for his best advice about Princeton. “Go to office hours,” he urged. “The saddest thing at Princeton is empty chairs at office hours.” I agree. And I am guilty. Our professors open their doors and offer us their undivided attention for about two hours a week, two hours that too often fall to the bottom of my list of priorities. But I think of professor Super and his advice and I wonder — how many answers and how many questions am I missing by skipping office hours? I’ve experimented. I’ve looked up the office hours of various professors and dropped in with or without a plan. I learned a whole new alphabet going to office hours with Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies lecturer Fauzia Farooqui. History professor Gyan Prakash told me some tales from his legendary hitchhiking road trip from India to the United Kingdom. Talking with Wilson School lecturer Barbara Bodine radically changed the way I see policymaking. Meeting Wilson School professor Stanley Katz as a freshman inspired me to resist autopilot at the University (full circle: He’s the one who introduced me to Super). Office hours have the potential to serve many needs that can be divided into two main categories: immediate academic help and long-term life advice. Office hours are a less formal time to meet with one’s preceptor about a challenging problem set, to ask a lingering question from lecture or to bounce ideas for a final essay. The best academic advice can come from our preceptors and professors; they were once undergrads too. Learning their paths to the University through graduate programs and books and dedication and advice from their own professors adds us to an enchanting chain of teaching and learning. Office hours are a time to quench curiosity and ignite imagination, a time to re-realize why we came to the University in the first place. When else can I ask a professor about their Pulitzer Prize-winning article or ask him or her to sign their book for my parents? Our Princeton experience is inevitably full of “empty chairs” — grants we didn’t apply for, fellowships we didn’t get, shows we didn’t see, books we didn’t read, classes we didn’t take — opportunities we missed because of time and the lack thereof. Thinking of all those opportunities ungrabbed is overwhelming; it defines a year in days we didn’t, instead of the days we did. It is easy to set a schedule and unintentionally cement it by not questioning our hours. It takes time to think about all that we are doing and takes even more to think about what we are not. However, it’s important to check in with ourselves and constantly reevaluate the way we take advantage of our time at the University. I don’t seek to spend my Princeton experience sitting, but I want to search for those empty chairs. I want to learn from professors in and beyond my concentration. Prioritizing office hours is an excellent way to start. Maybe we’ll see each other next week, filling the empty chairs.|~|Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill. She can be reached at accohen@princeton.edu.  
62774|~|Editorial: Standardize course audits |~|   April 17 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Every semester during course selection, students are faced with a difficult yet necessary task: deciding on only four or five classes. Even with four years, it’s difficult to take all classes of interest while trying to balance distribution requirements, prerequisites and departmental courses. Thus like many other institutions, the University allows students to audit courses, which are reflected on the transcript by “AUD.” While the official audit policy requires “successfully pass[ing] the final exam or complet[ing] some major component of the course,” professors and departments do not enforce this uniformly. Some professors give audit credit for only attending lecture while others require completion of all components of the course. The Board believes that while auditing can clearly enrich a liberal arts education, current audit rates at Princeton are too low. In order to make the system more clear and accessible, the University should standardize course audits by requiring either a minimum attendance rate of 85 percent or a passing grade on the final exam/paper. At a school like Princeton in which many courses have a heavy workload, auditing can be a solution for those who want to take interesting courses without pressure. Unlike pass/D/fail courses, failure in an audited course will not show up on the transcript. However, while it seems like a great opportunity for students who wish to learn beyond the minimum course requirements and receive recognition, audit statistics are shockingly low. For the Class of 2014, less than 5 percent have audited at least one course. This past fall semester, there were only 14 audits by all undergraduate students. A standardized and enforced system would encourage more auditing. Clear and uniform guidelines would increase awareness about the auditing system among all students. In addition, by uniformly eliminating final examinations (if the attendance is 85 percent), students will not see auditing a fifth or sixth class as an overwhelming time commitment and will be more likely to audit. As for those who cannot make all the lectures, the option to take a final still exists. Thus, the proposed standardized audit system recognizes those who have truly engaged with the course material. Yet there is still the question of confirming attendance. While some professors use sign-in sheets or call names at the beginning of class, it is difficult to keep track of attendance in larger classes. A possibility is using clickers, a technology that is already being used by some classes at the University. The Educational Technologies Center at the McGraw Center is able to equip and train faculty members who want to use technologies like clickers or Piazza. Piazza serves as an alternative to physical clickers since it simply requires students and faculty to create online accounts. The program can then be used to track attendance or facilitate responses to questions asked by the professor. As a great way to explore new interests, auditing can greatly add to a liberal arts education. However, without clear and enforced guidelines, the University’s auditing system fails to engage students. The Board believes that by standardizing the auditing system, more students would be encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity.|~|
62824|~|The commonality of faiths|~|   April 17 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|It was a quiet Tuesday night when my roommate and I decided to take a trip to the U-Store. We were trying to go less frequently, as the store takes so much of our money, but we both knew we had a late night of work ahead of us. We went our separate ways, weaving in and out of the aisles for the perfect snack. I checked the ingredients list of everything I picked up. “How on earth do these chips have milk in them?” I went through all the dark chocolate in the hopes of finding a reasonably priced, milk-free bar. The last straw was when I picked up a dark chocolate Snickers and found, not milk, but egg whites. “What is the point of egg whites in this!” My frustration startled a man next to me, who wryly asked, “What have you got against egg whites? It sounds serious.” Jackie and I both laughed and responded, “We’re fasting.” Lent is about 40 days long, typically starting on Ash Wednesday and ending on the day before Easter. Because many Christian denominations observe it, there are a number of distinctions between the traditions of each one. For example, my roommate is Catholic, and it is her practice to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, the Friday before Easter. Furthermore, Catholics do not eat meat on these days, as well as all Fridays of Lent. I, however, am Greek Orthodox. Lent begins on Clean Monday, which is not always the same week as Ash Wednesday — just like our Easter, Pascha, does not always fall on the same day as many Western Christian denominations. And for fasting, we are essentially vegan. While I have not always been fully vegan for Lent, I decided to do so this year, and Jackie joined me. But here is the point where some may ask: Why does this matter, especially if I’m neither Catholic nor Greek Orthodox? There are many reasons why learning about someone’s religion, or general way of life, is worthy of merit. But I think the greatest is that there is always a takeaway that is valuable even for those who do not practice. As of late, I’ve had a lot of conversations with friends of different religions and ways of life. One of my roommates, a good friend in my a cappella group, is Jewish, and I’ve found myself discussing her practices and involvement with the Center for Jewish Life on campus. My other roommate practices secular humanism, which I’ve learned celebrates ethics, human goodness and justice. Moreover, she took a seminar on the intersections between Buddhism and science, and just last week, we talked about Buddhism for about an hour over dinner. I learned about the way practicing Buddhists seek balance through the Middle Way, in avoidance of extremism of any emotion. When discussing all these faiths, I had an inordinate number of questions and comments. I can’t say I agreed with every aspect of each one, but there were facets that made me think deeply. And this is what makes hearing about other traditions and sharing your own so special. There is no such thing as total agreement about which way of life is best. Even within these individual faiths, there is disagreement. But this is true in almost every part of life — politics, science, literature. But were this to hinder us from listening to each other, we would never learn from one another and progress collectively. My faith is an inherently personal thing, but it affects my actions and interactions with others. An employee manual for a Christian would undoubtedly have listed, “Spread the gospel.” Truthfully, I don’t think this means, “Personally ensure that everyone you encounter is a Christian or becomes one.” That’s a strenuous task and, historically, human application of it can lead to undesirable results. Rather, I will happily tell you of my traditions in the hopes that you gain something personally. Lent is a perfect example of this. The observation may seem extraneous for those who don’t see the purpose of constant prayer, penance and atonement. My roommate, Rebecca, is proof that any form of fasting may have benefits. Of course, avoiding meats and cheeses and dairy is first a battle of willpower. But after week three, week four, week five, you realize something: You don’t truly need these things. You’ve been programmed by your environment to attach yourself to these earthly things. Forty days doesn’t create a greater willpower; it gives you freedom. And I think this is something that anyone of any faith can appreciate.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La. She can reached at ltrusty@princeton.edu. 
62684|~|The plight of the Princeton engineer|~|   April 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Mike Kosk As a high school senior I boasted to my alumni interviewer, a lifelong electrical engineer and biomedical researcher, about my passion for building and modifying things in my spare time. Whether that meant working with cars, bicycles or carpentry, I loved it all. Rather than being matched with enthusiasm however, I remember seeing a grimace overwhelm his face. “If that’s your passion, maybe Princeton isn’t the right place for you. Have you applied to MIT?” Engineering at Princeton, as I would later find out as an eager BSE student, did not mean getting to the nitty-gritty of building, welding and construction. It was, to my dismay, overly focused on academic and theoretical applications of engineering and applied sciences. The realization that, as a mechanical and aerospace engineering student, I would not get a chance to build a substantial project as part of my curriculum until the spring of my junior year destroyed any ounce of enthusiasm for the career path I had dreamed of. Reflecting on the current state of the engineering curriculum, I came to see this lack of practical engineering experience as part of a greater and more widespread trend on the Princeton campus. In light of the controversy regarding Princeton student’s tendency to flock towards finance and banking jobs, I want to pose this question: Have we stopped to consider that this trend could be more than just a product of the campus culture, but instead a product of the academic curriculum itself? By failing to expose its engineers to the applied aspects of engineering from an early point in their college education, I believe that Princeton predisposes — and in some ways pushes — its engineers into non-technical careers, such as finance and banking. Of the 54 MAE graduates in the Class of 2013, 14 went into non-technical industry jobs — that’s 26 percent. Following the “theory first” approach, engineers here first hone their quantitative and reasoning skills for two years before they have their first chance at hands-on engineering work. I am not arguing that this doesn’t constitute a logical approach to the study of engineering.  In fact, as my alumni interviewer would later qualify, Princeton engineers possess unrivaled adaptability to the changing technologies of industry — very likely due to their theoretical expertise. The problem I see with this core sciences curriculum is that it fails to expose students early on to an interesting and engaging aspect of their field. Without being exposed to the technical work that the engineering field consists of from an early point, how can we blame these individuals for finding their home on Wall Street? Without any experience directly working with mechanics or instrument design, it should be no surprise that many of our quantitatively strong engineers end up applying to finance and banking internships, where their particular set of skills is highly valued. Choosing to offer a curriculum that includes the practice of engineering does not impede on the strength of Princeton’s theoretical model of learning. Most other incredibly strong engineering schools, such as MIT, Stanford or the University of Illinois all emphasize a dual approach to the study. During their freshman year, MAE students at Northwestern complete a comprehensive design project that incorporates their theoretical knowledge with a practical application of skills that includes welding, machining and computer drafting. In addition to allowing visual, hands-on learners to see their studies reflected in practice, this opens up a new world of career possibilities and inspiration and more importantly keeps students interested by showing them how fun and engaging engineering can really be. If I can count myself in the statistics here, perhaps a diversified engineering curriculum could help retain the masses of BSE students who convert by year’s end. The Class of 2018 has had 25.3 percent of its students indicate they will enter the BSE program. By their sophomore year, that number will probably drop by a third. While most students are quick to dismiss AB conversions as an inability to maintain the BSE workload, little consideration is given to a lack of passion. As a Keller Center Fellow for innovation and design, I have heard endless complaints from my co-fellows about the lack of job opportunities in applied engineering offered through TigerTracks. During our discussions, the consensus was that this was symptomatic of the Wall Street culture on campus. Not once was it considered that this reflex was itself a product of the engineering curriculum. I believe including a practical engineering curriculum freshman year would be a great start to both expanding post-graduation options for engineers and reducing the ever-increasing BSE dropout rate by providing meaningful work that reflects their studies in practice. If they had done this earlier, perhaps I would be spending a lot more time on that side of campus now.|~|Mike Kosk is a philosophy major from Arlington Heights, Ill.

62636|~|EPA: Put in place a carbon standard|~|   April 16 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Isaac Lederman and Jeremy Zullow Making the right decisions is often tough. How do you know when it’s the right time to ask that special someone on a date? How do you know whether or not you should take a big risk and go all in? The Environmental Protection Agency’s decision on a potential carbon standard however, is a no-brainer. The EPA should not hesitate to put in place a carbon standard. People around the world, and especially here in New Jersey, can’t afford any more pollution from power plants, let alone any more devastation from climate change. And if the EPA is worried about backlash — which it might very well be — it should realize that putting in place a carbon standard also makes political sense. It’s not just young people like us that care about climate change — more and more Americans are seeing the light and feeling the heat. But first, a little bit of science. The Earth’s climate is changing. Power plants and other polluters are spewing gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases are trapping heat and making our planet not only warmer but also more dangerous to live on. And by heating up our only planet, these gases could very well trigger the release of other gases that would warm the Earth even more. Peat bogs, for instance, are emitting tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide due to this positive feedback cycle. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. In 2013, higher temperatures in Brazil led to the worst drought there in 50 years. This terrible drought may end up costing Brazil some $8 billion. But climate change also has devastating effects closer to home here in New Jersey. We don’t need to remind anybody in this area about all the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. Marines even had to come here to help the Garden State rebuild after the terrible storm. New Jersey may have lost as much as $70 billion, a figure that makes the damage caused by Brazil’s drought look like peanuts. Of course, the state’s recovery wasn’t helped by the fact that politics may have entered into this process. Though it’s still unclear what exactly happened, reports from CNN and The Huffington Post suggest that Gov. Christie may have used relief money to promote himself, reward his allies and punish his enemies. Although New Jersey hopefully won’t remain as vulnerable to corruption, its coastal location will most certainly continue to make it vulnerable to superstorms. Sadly, climate change isn’t the only threat facing New Jersey. Pollution from coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio continue to contaminate New Jersey’s water and fish and give residents asthma and lung disease, according to the Press of Atlantic City. The good news is that there is one thing that can help solve all these problems. All the EPA has to do is put in place a carbon standard for power plants. The standard would limit how much carbon dioxide power plants can dump into the air. If the EPA did that, people here in New Jersey would be able to quite literally breathe easier. They could worry less about superstorms destroying their livelihoods, corrupt politicians being empowered and droughts hurting those around the globe. Christie could also have the Garden State rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. RGGI is essentially a carbon standard of which states can choose to be a part. Making New Jersey a part of RGGI would not only create thousands of jobs but also reduce pollution and make the state less vulnerable to negative consequences of climate change. But given Christie’s fondness for blocking movement, especially along the George Washington Bridge, it seems pretty likely he’d block action on climate change too. Putting in place a carbon standard could seem like another pie-in-the-sky idea that will never get anywhere. The fact of the matter, however, is that more and more Americans are realizing the danger posed by climate change. We see people pushing for action on climate change every day on campus. We’re part of a growing group of students pushing the University to invest more sustainably so that it can align its investments with its values and show that climate change is a moral issue. And we’re not alone. More and more studies are showing that Americans are not only realizing climate change is happening but also becoming concerned about its impacts on their livelihoods. If anything, the EPA would be doing what the people want by putting in place a tough carbon standard. Of course, we can’t always expect people to act sensibly. Just ask our governor.|~|Isaac Lederman is the co-president of Students United for a Responsible Global Environment and is a Wilson School major from New York, N.Y.

62644|~|All in your head|~|   April 16 2014|~|Columns Mental Health Opinion |~|Cameron Langford|~|None|~|The first time I go to Counseling and Psychological Services, I attempt to check in downstairs at the familiar University Health Services front desk, where in a snotty midwinter haze, I have been several times before. It isn’t until I lower my voice to clarify that I am here for a consultation with a counselor that they send me to the third floor. I think I detect a mournful tone in the receptionist’s voice. I decide it’s all in my head. Upstairs, I discover that the comfortable CPS waiting room operates by different social rules than the folding chairs outside UHS. On the first floor, where the signs of your ailment are made visible by an ankle brace or a clutched tissue, conversation flows naturally, self-deprecatingly. But the third floor is hushed, tomblike. I learn the rules quickly and by example: sit quietly, swipe open your smartphone, don’t smile if you recognize an acquaintance from precept or even a friend. Later, when I see a friend who had also been in the waiting room that afternoon, scrawling personal information on clinical forms, we do not mention our encounter. Mental healthcare on college campuses became a hot topic this January, when a Yale student wrote an article detailing her allegedly forced withdrawal after revealing her suicide attempt to Yale’s counseling services. And several columnists have written this year on the value of destigmatizing mental health problems at Princeton. It seems that college students, and Princeton students in particular, like the idea of a university culture that extends a hand to those in need — and that we react strongly when those most in need are pushed away, like the Princeton student revealed last month to have allegedly been forced to withdraw following his suicide attempt. It’s important that Princeton as an institution provides resources for those students experiencing severe mental distress. Yet I worry that there is still a perception on campus that CPS is only for those who are so depressed they want to harm themselves or can’t get out of bed. With this mentality, we brand those who seek treatment as the proverbial other, as a group whose day-to-day lives at Princeton look nothing like ours. To go to CPS thus comes to feel like admitting to something much more serious than run-of-the-mill stress. And so, for those not suffering from diagnosed mental illness, feelings of inadequacy or anxiety are often compartmentalized as just another thing to deal with — a regrettable but inevitable aspect of Princeton life. We’ll talk willingly — sometimes almost giddily, as if having the most miserable week ahead were some kind of college accomplishment — about being busy or stressed. But often we have a hard time admitting that sometimes these feelings go deeper than doing poorly on a single assignment or feeling “off” for a day; they clutch onto a deeper sense of who we are, a worry that we’re failing in all senses. Or at least they have the potential to, if let untreated. Mental health, like physical health, requires some amount of preventative care. Symptoms of much more serious issues manifest themselves in smaller ways earlier on. Most of what I’ve talked about at CPS hasn’t been the big stuff. It’s been about the creeping feelings of anxiety I get about speaking in precept, the challenges of dealing with a heavy drinking culture, the sadness of watching friends prepare to graduate. But paradoxically, the only way I have been able to prevent these little things from becoming Big Things is by carving out a time in my schedule to give them weight, to talk about them with someone whose entire job is to talk about these kinds of things. After all, it’s easier to treat the mental sniffles than full-blown bronchitis. Like its first-floor counterpart, of course, CPS is not a panacea. More than one friend has confessed to me that they found CPS off-puttingly cold — a side effect, no doubt, of the long waits for appointments and the diversity of therapists’ personality types. I was lucky in that I clicked with the first doctor I saw. But I think it’s worth giving CPS another shot (or two) even if your first time isn’t so pleasant. More importantly, though, it’s worth talking about your experience afterward, good or bad. This has the potential both to improve care at CPS and, more crucially, to improve access by letting fellow students know they’re not alone. If, like I was, you’re waiting for someone to tell you that it’s okay to go to CPS just because you feel like your workload is too much, like you’re letting yourself down by getting a middling exam grade, like every once in a while you’re just tired of caring so damn much: It’s okay. And if you want to talk about it afterward, don’t be afraid to tell a friend. You might just find that they’ve been, too.|~|Cameron Langford is a politics major from Davidson, N.C.

62442|~|Letter to the Editor: Response to Tory criticism |~|   April 15 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|On Monday, The Daily Princetonian published a response to a piece that I originally authored for the Princeton Tory’s online blog, entitled “The 10 Worst Courses Offered at Princeton in Fall 2014.” In his response, Bennett McIntosh eloquently argues against the assertion that certain courses at Princeton are “worthless” and articulates why Princetonians should be encouraged to be adventurous in the classes that they elect to take. Although McIntosh meant for his op-ed to serve as a response to my article, I do not disagree with the points that he makes and never meant for my post on the Princeton Tory’s blog to be taken as a serious critique of Princeton’s courses or world-class faculty. Indeed, as the first paragraph of my post claims, the piece was only intended to provide “comedic value” for readers, which (admittedly) many people feel it failed to accomplish. While Bennett McIntosh presents a very eloquent case in his op-ed, he seeks to ascribe a particular motive to the original piece that was never present. The Tory blog post arguably did not fulfill its comedic purpose, but no malice was intended toward any professors or their classes. Nevertheless, I take full responsibility for the purpose of my article being misconstrued. Within one day of the article’s publication (before The Daily Princetonian ever published a response), I had already requested that the Tory staff remove the article since its interpretation did not match my intended message. Within that same time frame, I also issued individual apologies to each professor mentioned in the article and offered to meet with them in person to better understand the content of the courses discussed. While I do not wish to divulge the complete details of our personal correspondence, many of the professors whom I contacted said that they realized the article was meant to be taken in jest, and I appreciate their understanding. Princeton has afforded me so many excellent opportunities — both within and outside the classroom. I very much appreciate all of the exceptional academic experiences that the University has made possible and sincerely apologize if the article indicated otherwise. Admittedly, it was reckless to try to satirize courses without doing more thorough research into each class. However, once I realized this mistake, I quickly made sure that the article was redacted so that my opinions were not misconstrued. This was not done out of cowardice. As a contributor to other news organizations outside of Princeton, I have not been shy about defending my true convictions, even against hostile audiences or comment boards. However, the way that my article on the Tory blog was ultimately interpreted did not reflect my true convictions about the quality of Princeton courses and educators, and therefore I had no desire to defend it further. Hopefully, as a community, we can move forward to discussing issues that warrant real debate. Signed, Evan Draim ’16   Addendum to “Avoid these worthless classes!” As I have mentioned elsewhere, I did not mention Evan Draim’s name in my column because he removed his name and retracted the post, so I did not want to direct unwanted attention in his direction. I regret if that decision caused any confusion as to the official editorial stance of the Tory, or Draim’s position as a staffer thereof. In the meantime, I am glad that Horton, Draim and I have been able to foster discussion on this important issue. Signed, Bennett McIntosh|~|

62452|~|Writing on the wall|~|   April 15 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|David Will|~|None|~|A new structure went up on campus over the weekend — which wouldn’t normally be news — but this one’s a bit different. A gigantic penis is emblazoned across it in bronze spray paint, for one thing. And then, not to be outdone, someone else drew a neon pink vagina to accompany it. Amid the genitalia — which, to be fair, only comprise a small section of the structure’s surface — are unsigned statements of angst and discontent. The edifice itself comprises seven white wooden boards, each about 8 feet high and 4 feet wide, which are linked to one another by six unpainted (and un-graffitied) wooden planks. Together, the boards zigzag to resemble a room divider. The project was launched as a part of the class, VIS 439: Art as Interaction. According to the class’s twitter feed and Facebook page, it was unveiled on the North Lawn of the Frist Campus Center on Sunday, April 13. The work is entitled “What Will You Bring to the Surface?”. It dares observers to get involved by urging passersby to jot down things that trouble them but that they are afraid to say aloud. The idea, I surmise, is to empower students to air their grievances with impunity. Based on the diverse, at times profanity-laden, complaints scrawled on the boards, it seems to have worked. Posts range from multi-sentence tirades against oligarchs to — what I would hope are — sardonic defenses of Susan Patton ’77. Substantive concerns are mixed in with digs at Vineyard Vines and boat shoes. One of the more legitimate gripes — “where are the professors of color?” — provoked a string of responses about the issue’s importance. At this corner of the board, at least, the project succeeds. It has exposed student concerns and engaged strangers in dialogue about issues that we are normally too trepidatious to address. Students scurrying from class to class stop, gaze at the structure and sometimes chat. Everyone with whom I spoke sorted the writings into three categories: the humorously raunchy, the peculiar or even offensive and the things they themselves felt but couldn’t muster the words to say. Each statement, it seemed, could be placed in any of those three boxes, depending on whom you talked to. The project’s genius is evident in its skeptics’ reactions. A friend of mine threatened in jest to vandalize it by writing something outlandish or obscene. The irony of his plan wasn’t lost on him for long. After all, carrying out his idea would mean interacting with the artwork exactly as it was intended to be experienced: as a platform through which to express criticism. The blank boards clearly fill a void left by students’ reticence to be publicly vulnerable. It is not that we are afraid, we are certainly a bold group — but above all we are ambitious and like to avoid sideshows on our paths to success. As a result, we tend to perceive everything from admissions of insecurities to political discourse as potential pitfalls that might compromise our futures. Coming to Princeton, I expected it to be competitive and cutthroat. What I found instead was a sense of individual intensity and heightened awareness of how one is perceived by others. Every Princeton student — myself included — dedicates enormous energy to cultivating their image as a Princetonian — that quasi-mythical, always elusive go-getter who has it all. None of this is healthy or sustainable. Academic and extracurricular burdens are daunting enough without students feeling as if they have to be their own public relations agents, constantly projecting a veneer of perfection over their stresses and flaws. Most, if not all of it, is self-inflicted and mutually reinforcing. Admit it: At least a bit of the reason why we constantly feign exhaustion and exaggerate our workloads and stress levels is so that when we succeed, our achievements seem that much greater. Few people are as forthcoming about their defeats, because those just don’t happen to Princetonians. Don’t get me wrong — we’re overworked, but the way to cope isn’t to puff ourselves up. Instead, we should admit our shortcomings and work together to overcome them. Doing so means rejecting the ludicrous stigma around failure that hangs over campus culture. Maybe then we’d feel freer to participate in campus-wide discourse on some of the issues raised on the boards. That is the art project’s gift to students: It’s a public forum for honesty and artistic expression. In one sense it is an interactive platform; in another, however, it’s a monument, a testament to internal struggles that we all harbor but rarely share.|~|David Will is a religion major from Chevy Chase, Md.

62439|~|What "check your privilege" really means|~|   April 15 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Since every issue of The Tory, Princeton’s major conservative student publication, is pushed underneath my door, I tend to flip through it and scan anything that happens to catch my interest. In this particular issue, I was immediately drawn to “Checking My Privilege,” an article written by Tal Fortgang ’17. Once I got past the irrelevant, anti-liberal rhetoric — comparing the use of the phrase “check your privilege” to the descent of “an Obama-sanctioned drone” did little to help me understand Fortgang’s argument — I realized that Fortgang wasn’t wrong. He just didn’t get it. The main umbrage Fortgang and others who share his opinion take with the phrase “check your privilege” is that they take the colloquialism personally. Fortgang’s article is reminiscent of the 2013 incident at Minneapolis Community and Technical College (MCTC), where three white males criticized Professor Shannon Gibney for how she was discussing race issues in class. The students felt personally reprimanded for structural racism because of their identity as white men. However, Professor Gibney — and anyone involved in race, gender, sexuality and other identity discussions — is not directly criticizing every white male. Similarly, every white male’s accomplishments and personal family ancestry are not condemned or negated by the privilege debate. Instead, “checking” one’s privilege is meant to provide a more universal outlook and a heightened awareness of greater societal trends and stereotypes that we have each internalized. What Fortgang does not realize is that privilege does not necessarily require being able to trace your lineage back to Rockefeller or Vanderbilt. Privilege can be independent of your family’s past, of your actual socioeconomic status, of real hardship you or your ancestors may have endured. What privilege means is being able to confidently enter any social sphere without fear of rejection. Privilege means never questioning the bias of the feedback and grading you receive from your professors or employers. Privilege means living your life free from consideration and hyper-awareness of your race, gender or sexuality. Privilege does not, therefore, mean that you yourself have lived a life of complete affluence and comfortable apathy; it is instead possessing certain attributes or traits that are regarded as desirable — or being free from particular traits that are deemed undesirable — and that have typically allowed their possessor to live a relatively advantaged life. Whiteness and maleness are two such attributes. But even as a non-white, non-heterosexual, I am more than aware of my privilege. My family is upper-middle class, I am receiving an Ivy League education, I attended one of my state’s best public schools and I am a man. I know that although I may feel that my personal experience does not reflect it, I am in a position of privilege. Who am I to say that, had I been female, had my family lived below the poverty line,  I could have undoubtedly achieved the same standard of life with the same ease with which I did?  Unfortunately, structural discrimination does exist, and it is difficult to tease apart what aspects of my life have been affected by internalized stereotypes and circumstance. The recognition of our privilege is critical for the achievement of the truly meritocratic system that Fortgang so idealistically alludes to in his article. Awareness of the historic disadvantages of others enlightens us to what advances are yet to be made and reminds us that institutions such as the LGBT Center, the Women’s Center and the Black Students’ Union are necessary as long as those for which they are meant to support believe them to be. We all need to “check” our privilege until the Equal Protection clause Fortgang mentions in his article truly does protect each citizen regardless of their identity.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

62287|~|Letter to the Editor: On utility and education in the ‘Prince’ and The Tory|~|   April 14 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Bennett McIntosh penned a column published yesterday titled “Avoid these worthless classes!” in response to a recent blog post by Evan Draim ’16 for The Princeton Tory. In my capacity as publisher of said publication, I will neither wholly defend nor entirely denounce Draim’s piece. As a blog post, Draim’s “The 10 Worst Courses Offered at Princeton in Spring 2014” does not represent the views of The Princeton Tory or the Editorial Team thereof, contrary to what McIntosh’s column implied, by abstaining from naming the author and instead referring to the piece solely as “the Tory post.” The blog post’s retraction was granted at the author’s request and not as the result of editorial censorship or averse public reaction. The Princeton Tory seeks to give voice to a variety of opinions in order to stimulate conversation in the University community; to impute any of these authorial opinions to The Princeton Tory itself, however, would be akin to treating McIntosh’s column as an official statement of The Daily Princetonian’s stance. Having made these preliminary clarifications, I now turn to the substance of McIntosh’s criticism. The thrust of his criticism is certainly spot on: evaluating education strictly according to the criterion of “usefulness in ‘the real world’ ” is indeed inimical to a proper appreciation of the liberal arts. However, McIntosh’s argument self-destructs. In lambasting Draim’s utilitarian approach as “threaten[ing] both the integrity and the utility of education,” McIntosh incoherently falls back upon the very premise that he purports to be criticizing: namely, that a liberal arts education is valuable primarily for its utility (howsoever construed) in pursuing a career beyond the University i.e. in “the real world.” A utilitarian, career-centric defense of the liberal arts is always bound to fail. Consider the study of metaphysics, a subdiscipline of philosophy. Such a study has no immediate use in itself — unless, of course, you seek to become a philosophy professor. (Why you would want to become a metaphysics professor if the discipline’s only utility is to train those who subsequently will fill your shoes is an awkward question for a naive utilitarian.) The classic response McIntosh delivers goes something like this: “Ah, but you see, philosophy cultivates critical thinking skills and helps to stretch the mind in creatively connecting ideas; in turn, these capacities prepare students for a variety of careers.” Q.E.D. Not so fast. The problem here is that this argument does nothing to defend the intrinsic value of philosophy (or whichever subject you want to pick on). By this logic, anything that develops the same requisite skills of critical thinking and creativity is equally good. Should a better substitute be discovered, philosophy could be left to wither without loss. A philosophy concentrator myself, I cringe at the notion, and I would imagine that McIntosh and perhaps you, my reader, might find this troubling as well. Thus, McIntosh’s argument is in need of considerable amends. Allow me to revamp McIntosh’s criticism accordingly. What he should have said is this: study of the liberal arts is intrinsically good and choiceworthy for itself, besides the extrinsic benefits and skills that may accompany it (e.g. getting a job in “the real world”). Education in the liberal arts tradition is an end and not merely a means. It is something of value for itself and not just for utility — however Draim or McIntosh would construe the term. This fundamental goodness of intellectual life, of study and contemplation for its own sake, is the root of Aristotle’s famous claim that the best and happiest life is that of theoretical contemplation. As he wrote in the “Nicomachean Ethics,” “happiness extends just as far as study extends, and the more someone studies, the happier he is, not coincidentally but insofar as he studies, since study is valuable in itself” (1178b29). We would do well to reflect on that as we enjoy the blessing of a Princeton education throughout the remainder of this semester and, of course, as we go about choosing our classes for the next. As I promised at the outset, I neither accept nor reject Draim’s stance wholesale. My criticism by now should be apparent. In spite of my principled objection to his mode of course evaluation, like Draim, I do not subscribe to the misguidedly egalitarian notion that any course is as just good as another. That said, plucking out “useless” classes based entirely on course descriptions is not the most helpful exercise in advising fellow students on how best to pursue a traditional liberal arts education. Therefore, on behalf of The Princeton Tory, I invite you to visit theprincetontory.com later this week for an online-exclusive “Best Fall 2014 Courses to Round Out a Liberal Arts Education.” Signed, Zach Horton  Publisher of The Princeton Tory Editor’s note: Zach Horton is also a member of The Daily Princetonian Editorial Board, but is writing this letter in his capacity as Publisher of The Princeton Tory.|~|
62231|~|Incomplete and halfway done |~|   April 14 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|In her April 11 column “Ordinary people,” Morgan Jerkins tries to remind us that in spite of the distractions of an overwhelming workload, extracurriculars and the general stress that comes with being a Princeton student, the University allows us the chance to interact with world-renowned scholars and academic legends. She reminds us that while we are hustling to the next place we have to be, we often forget that we’re here — if only for just four years — at an incredible university. Now, I’m not trying to sell Princeton to all the prefrosh out there who are still deciding; after all, I certainly didn’t when they were here, checking out the campus during Preview. On the night of Preview, I remember getting ready to walk out the doors of the U-Store, carrying my grocery bag of Nutella, Singapore noodles and Red Bull — clearly ready for the horrendous all-nighter that would follow. Unfortunately, in my rush to leave the U-Store to get back to my room, I got stuck behind a group of prefrosh. They were all excitedly discussing the classes they had audited and how they liked their hosts. As they conversed and slowly exited the building, all I could think was, “life is not nearly long enough for them to be walking this slowly.” But in the process of mulling over how much I had to do and everywhere I had to go, I had completely forgotten where I was. When I see McCosh Hall, I don’t see the gorgeous building, the beautiful courtyard or the impressive chapel flanking its sides. I see the 1:30 p.m. class that I’m obviously going to be late for, because I had once again turned in an assignment late on Blackboard, and the minutes were counting down until I would get 30 percent of my grade docked off. When I see my dorm building, the historic Witherspoon Hall, I don’t see a place that had once been described by Harper’s Weekly as “one of the most commanding college buildings in the world.” I see the room I have to clean, the room that contains a pile of textbooks and notes, and the room whose windows don’t always have the best insulation. I find that, regardless of where they came from or what socioeconomic background they grew up in before attending this institution, many students eventually manage to find a laundry list of flaws in their experience here. While many of these complaints are valid — some even acknowledged by the University in its programs of improvement — I find that being “used to Princeton” makes me forget what Princeton meant to us when we had first come here. The worst part of it all is that many of us who have already been here for a year or more almost seem to think that it’s better that we’re “jaded”— that we are somewhat superior for figuring out what Princeton “really” is, when compared to our younger peers who haven’t yet. But if we really think about it, why is this at all desirable? Shouldn’t we admire the students who manage to find something extraordinary about their college lives every day, as we once did before we let essays, midterms and finals eclipse this enthusiasm? There are many things about Princeton that make our experiences here worthwhile, and it’s not just the solidarity between students that comes from complaining about grade deflation. After all, even now, I believe and certainly hope that many people wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.  We can almost definitely count on finding dependable friends for life, discovering new passions in theater, a new language or at an internship in the south of France, having the chance to engage with professors who can teach us lessons beyond books, and counting on an everyday certainty that we’ll be going to a class that had an impact on somebody’s life. Surely that’s something we can deliver to the hopeful prefrosh before decisions come out. I’m almost a junior, and soon I’ll be halfway done. I have junior papers, senior thesis and many a difficult departmental left in my major. I am sad to say I have made my experience sound incomplete or almost unsatisfactory by complaints like “I can’t believe all the washers are filled; I hate everyone on this floor,” or “I really hope this class has some nonconcentrators, otherwise I’m screwed,” or “Why aren’t there more bus routes throughout campus?” I certainly hope I can shed these nitpicky criticisms, lest I leave this place with the regret that I didn’t appreciate it more while I was here.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.

62249|~|Identity by association |~|   April 14 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ali Akram Hayat|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“So, where are you from?” I was first asked this question during International Orientation. I considered it bland and boring. “Lahore, Pakistan,” I retorted. Everyone was international. Big deal. I have since been asked this question countless times. While my response has remained static, my feelings when asked the question have vacillated a great deal. From the excitement I felt at the response of my Community Action group members, to the — I’ll be frank — disgust at the looks of judgment I drew from some when I was sitting at a dinner discussion on U.S. foreign policy toward Pakistan, answering this question has been anything but bland and boring. My answer, though, has continued to exhibit those traits: “Lahore, Pakistan.” Growing up in a community very different from that of Princeton, I never considered myself a good fit for the society I was part of. My life experiences have been vastly different from those of the overwhelming majority of my fellow countrymen and women. I held, and continue to hold, views that do not gel with popular opinion. I even prefer soccer to cricket. But as soon as I utter “Lahore, Pakistan,” I am assumed to be a representative of the Pakistani people, their voice to the Princeton community. There is an onus on me to explain political moves that my government is making, or defend cultural practices that don’t sit well with some of my peers here. Never mind what I actually think about any of these things: my job is to be the voice of the average Pakistani. I was once invited to join a discussion about the U.S. army conducting drone strikes in part of Northwestern Pakistan. One of my friends had recently stumbled upon an article online that condemned these apparent attacks on sovereignty and presumably wanted me to endorse this view. When I declared that I did not quite oppose these strikes, I was met with surprise. “Interesting,” one person remarked. I couldn’t quite understand what was so interesting about my view on this, especially since he hadn’t even heard my reasons yet. Just the fact that I disagreed with what he had assumed, without ever meeting me, based on his perception of my identity vis-à-vis my country, was enough to make my declaration to the contrary a surprise. This, I thought, was more interesting than my response. I think that others’ assumptions about my views based on a few simple facts about my association with a place stifle the aim of creating a diverse community at Princeton. I was not chosen attend the University as the average Pakistani. I was chosen as me. Diversity is a much lauded aspect of institutions like ours — and rightly so. A diverse community brings together a multitude of perspectives into the marketplace of ideas. It is one of the key forces that drive academic work and facilitate intellectual growth. A diversity of opinions lights up precept discussions and dinnertime conversations. It reopens previously examined texts and readings in a wholly novel light, and lends us lenses to view the world in alternate ways — sometimes more accurate ways. Yet we sometimes take certain facets of our diverse community for granted. The students and faculty at the dinner discussion I went to projected their own image of what I should be onto me. This was counterproductive and scarcely allowed for much diversion. Given a few simple facts about a person’s belonging to a certain group or place, we, in our eagerness to delve into the pool of learning that this diverse environment offers, automatically attach notions and qualities to the person. I don’t think this enforced identity is malicious, or even intentional. It is something we create for each other on a subconscious level but should consciously aim to avoid. Where we are from plays a huge role in defining our characters, not only as students and learners, but also as people. The challenges we have faced have molded us and armed us with tools to face further challenges, especially in such a different community from the one we originally belonged to. But they have molded us in different ways, even if the challenges might be similar. How we respond to these challenges defines us, not the experience itself. We must not box each other or ourselves in the identity we are granted by association with a group. This association acts merely as a starting point. This is because no two Pakistanis are alike. No two international students are alike. No two students, two people are alike. Appreciating and celebrating diversity is about acknowledging this straightforward but hugely important fact about the world. So the next time I answer “Lahore, Pakistan,” it is safe to assume that I carry a different baggage of experiences from most people I interact with, borne out of this fact about me. Anything beyond this assumption is a symptom of our failure to understand true diversity.|~|Ali Akram Hayat is a sophomore from Lahore, Pakistan. He can be reached at ahayat@princeton.edu.

62128|~|Only "yes" means yes|~|   April 13 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|I went home for a weekend recently and my parents, who I think of as fairly progressive thinkers, were having a dinner party with like-minded friends. The conversation drifted to the recent acquittal in Hanover of a Dartmouth student, who was on trial for allegedly sexually assaulting a fellow student. Both students had been drinking that night. There may have been a question about how clearly the female student said no, but she most certainly did not say yes to the sexual contact. I was dismayed by how closely the attitudes of the middle-aged women (and men) at my parents’ party tracked the thinking of Susan Patton ’77. At a recent panel held in the Whig Clio Senate Chabmer, Patton claimed that women are responsible for being raped if they dress provocatively and drink too much. As columnist Cameron Langford noted last week, I agree with the sentiment that we limit the sexual assault cases reported and simply exacerbate the problem when we choose to blame the victim. Patton and others are mistaken about how sexual assault often occurs on campus. While Patton rambled in a feeble attempt to defend herself against a room of angry students, I realized that she just didn’t understand what is happening. Patton seemed to see only two scenarios where women claim rape. One, they said no and they were assaulted anyhow. Like just about every rational person, she acknowledged this was rape. The only other scenario she discussed was when a female agreed to have sex (i.e. consented by saying yes) and then regretted it in the morning and alleged rape. Patton called this “regrettable sex,” and so long as the woman truly was in a state to consent, Patton is at least correct in saying that this isn’t rape. Unfortunately, Patton and others don’t acknowledge that there are shades between what is obviously consensual sex and what everyone agrees is obviously rape. But those shades do exist, and they are considered rape under the law. If the woman is too incapacitated to consent, not saying anything must be considered “no” under all state law. If someone is taking advantage of another person’s inebriated state and coerces consent, this too must be considered assault. And while these shades of gradation might be difficult to prove in a courtroom, jurors must approach the case with the understanding that the lack of explicit consent is considered sexual assault under most US state laws. When Patton doesn’t even acknowledge that it would be the man’s fault if he has sex with a woman too inebriated to consent, she highlights the problem that society does not understand what consent really entails and what most laws uphold. Instead, she wrongly blames the victim for getting drunk and lets the aggressor off scot-free. This scenario is common, and it is rape. It is occurring on college campuses across the country, and our parents, our school administrators and often our college policies don’t recognize this issue. With any luck, policymakers who have followed the recent Dartmouth case are appalled at the acquittal and will begin to realize that this situation is real and must be acknowledged as rape in order for this behavior to stop. SHARE is right that increased bystander intervention will help. But we need a shift in thinking and policy or even fewer cases of sexual assault will be reported and the problem will only be exacerbated. The case at Dartmouth, as well as at Harvard, Columbia and so many other colleges, where reported sexual assaults go unpunished, demonstrate that we have an epidemic of rape on college campuses that requires policy changes by administrators. Policies and laws, and the people or juries judging these rules, must acknowledge that only a “yes” is consent. It is no longer adequate to espouse that “no means no” — rather, yes means yes. With such policies, juries would understand that what happened at Dartmouth has to be considered as rape, as no explicit consent was given. Then justice would be met and more victims would be encouraged to report these sexual assaults. These assaults are not just some drunken mistake. Given that April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, now is a great time to have this discussion with your parents, grandparents and siblings to help them differentiate between true consent and sexual assault.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C.

62106|~|Avoid these worthless classes!|~|   April 13 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|Last week, the University’s premier magazine of conservative thought, The Princeton Tory, posted a list (now retracted) of the sort that has become an unfortunate fixture of American conservative publications: a list of worthless college courses. Sprouting up everywhere from Conservapedia to Business Insider, the idea that American higher education has been overrun by a rash of useless classes has dug its way into the American consciousness. The alleged culprits for this epidemic range from lazy students to liberal professors bringing their skewed views of the world into the classroom, but the underlying message in dismissing so many courses offhand is that college education should fit strict ideals of usefulness in “the real world.” Of course, I cannot defend every course, professor or college attacked in such an article on the basis of their own merits, but creating a category of “useless” courses we are simply uncomfortable with is dangerous and threatens both the integrity and the utility of education. As the Tory post itself reminds us, “a liberal arts education is meant to challenge students’ perspectives, introduce them to new ideas, and prepare participants for successful careers in the 21st century.” How better to challenge perspectives and introduce new ideas than by examining, if not taking, courses which seem at first blush tangential and offbeat? Mocking a course based solely upon a cursory and closed-minded reading of its online description represents a disturbing intellectual laziness. The mentality that it builds is worse — if we as students are to avoid exposing ourselves to new ideas because they challenge our perception of which ideas are connected, we are actively opposing the critical thinking and consideration that make a liberal arts education valuable. Worse is that so many such articles obviously set out to find strange and “useless” courses, and, in doing so, approach the curricula with a closed mind — reading to mock rather than to learn. If the reaction to reading about HIS 544: The Environmental History of Medieval Europe is to crack jokes about Al Gore’s “time machine device” and ignore the ideas at hand, we have little hope of learning from medieval deforestation, land use and natural resource exploitation — and perhaps of learning something about these struggles in our own time. A student who desires only to learn about what he or she already knows about can hardly be called a student at all — these classes are essential to our freedom to learn. But how do such classes prepare students for careers? A better question is how can we expect to prepare for careers in the 21st century without challenging our beliefs or making connections between seemingly disjoint ideas? It is all well and good to train future financiers, politicians and scientists in finance, politics or science, but the well-established curricula for these vocations represent the way the world is now, or more often the way the world was years to decades ago when curricula were set. To prepare us, the students, for modern careers, we need to study modern issues — issues which come from the interplay between widely divergent trends. Consider one of the courses riffed by the Tory post, AMS 358: Electronic Literature: Lineage, Theory, and Contemporary Practice. While modern college students are indisputably aware of the interplay between social media and their life, precious few have pondered what information technology means for modern literature. Before reading the course description, I hadn’t either, except to mourn the loss of paper books. But I’m now intrigued, for e-books are still a surpassingly static medium, and literature formats which can adapt to and grow with the internet can have vastly more influence. Imagine if The Grapes of Wrath had been published in the format of The New York Times’ features “Snow Fall” or “A Game of Shark and Minnow,” which integrate new formats into in-depth analysis. Anyone who hopes to take a career in journalism, policy or literature would do well to examine the direction in which literature and media are moving, and understand the pitfalls and strengths of this way of storytelling. Even if you, like me, are not planning a career in policy or journalism, the careers that we millennials will hold will be dependent on communication so understanding how ideas spread nowadays — whether via AMS 358 or “Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame,” which tops Business Insider’s list — will be essential for everyone. And this goes for courses which touch on the interplay between, say, poverty and disease, or revolution and entertainment — without considering such interplays, no college can claim to educate effective leaders. So next time you see a silly or surprising course, use it as an opportunity to question your world, not to mock or lament how ridiculous college classes are nowadays. The trend is nowhere near as worrisome and corrupting as one might think, based solely upon list articles online and offhand jokes about underwater basket weaving. Don’t succumb to the temptation to dismiss potentially world-changing ideas as trivial or ridiculous. Instead, read the description with an open mind and maybe even take the class — you just might learn something.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a sophomore from Littleton, Colo.

62087|~|Editorial: Improving advising |~|   April 13 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|As course selection approaches, students are again faced with the issue of academic advising. The courses students take at the University are integral to their Princeton experience. These important decisions are best made with knowledgeable and experienced advice, but such advice is not easily available. Though the University has some competent resources in the assigned faculty advisers, peer advisers through the residential colleges and contact information and databases such as Major Choices or course reviews, the Board believes that these resources fall short of their effectiveness due to their fragmentation, lack of publicity and near-sighted focus on just the next semester. We believe that increased training for faculty advisers and a focus on a long-term comprehensive path through Princeton academics, along with improved awareness of already available resources, will enhance the benefits of academic advising. Faculty academic advisers for underclassmen are assigned at the beginning of freshman year to oversee course selection. These advisers are not necessarily in the same field as the student and often have limited familiarity with courses and professors beyond their own departments. Meetings are usually only once a semester and consist of a cursory glance at preventing an overburdened schedule and ensuring that distribution requirements and prerequisites are met before signing approval. The Board recognizes the difficulties involved in pairing student and faculty interests and sees the inconveniences of having underclassmen selecting their own advisers. The practicable improvement lies in equipping all the advisers with training necessary for knowledgeably proposing different possible academic paths. Instead of limiting the focus to creating a tolerable next semester, students would be better served if advisers took an interest in helping them see longer-term options and expanding to consider the practical benefits and experience of courses in different fields. Many of the more diverse and interesting upper-level courses require certain prerequisites, and advisers could be more helpful in outlining steps necessary to take a potentially desired set of classes in a semester or two. Princeton has great courses in all departments, and being able to encourage students to taste the unique skills of different subjects would provide a more complete education. Training faculty advisers to be familiar with the prerequisites necessary for advancing in courses in other departments as well as knowing the varied benefits of different courses empower students to chart a path of more interesting, advanced and comprehensive options. Some students informally find the guidance of older students, but not everyone has this convenience. The University does have several resources for students to reach out and connect with upperclassmen, such as lists on the Major Choices website and contacts of Peer Academic Advisers on residential college websites, but the fragmentation of these scattered listings and contacts weakens their benefits and does a disservice to the University’s efforts. Moreover, many students are simply not effectively made aware of these tools. Professors, preceptors, faculty advisers and even residential college advisers do not clearly or frequently promote these. For example, each residential college has a list of Peer Academic Advisers who are juniors and seniors willing to be a resource for other students. These advisers are from various departments, and the websites list the specific courses and programs they can advise on as well as how to get in contact with them. The Peer Academic Advisers should be consolidated into one searchable online resource.  The consolidation would make it more accessible and user-friendly for underclassman and also more available for upperclassmen that are not part of the residential college system. In the meantime, to spread awareness of these helpful yet fragmented tools, RCAs and faculty advisers should be instructed to show these options to their advisees. Modifying the approach of faculty academic advisers and taking steps to publicize and make databases and resources more readily available would strengthen students’ academic paths and reaffirm the University’s comprehensive support of a truly engaging course of studies.|~|
62011|~|Letter to the Editor: April 10, 2014|~|   April 10 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Upon reading the April 9th article about the University’s response to the informal hosting program, I was dismayed by the quote that read, “They’re not sanctioning the plans necessarily, but they’re not trying to get us to cancel them either.” I believe this line does not accurately define the University’s opinion on the informal hosting efforts. In fact, we are very much hoping that students will follow the University’s lead, and not participate in informal overnight hosting. Again, the University canceled the formal hosting program for well-considered reasons — to reduce risk among a population of students who have not been vaccinated and may not be well-informed about best practices to stay safe. We strongly discourage Princeton students, all of whom we are certain are well-meaning, from doing this informally on their own. While, finally, students will make their own choices, our hope is that they will not undermine the University’s message. Michael Olin Associate Dean of Undergraduate Students Princeton University|~|

61936|~|Ordinary people |~|   April 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|It was early Friday morning when I randomly decided to take a shift at Frist Campus Center because one of my commitments had gotten pushed back a few hours. The area was rather quiet, so I decided to get some work done and simultaneously talk to my co-worker, who also happens to be a good friend of mine. Like clockwork, a few visitors started to approach the desk, and our conversations began to diverge. My conversation with a student ended early, and I looked over to my co-worker’s side to see a man dressed in dark clothing talking about the etymology of the word “person.” At first, I suspected that he was just an older visitor on campus who enjoyed talking to students before going on a self-guided, leisurely tour around campus. He was fascinated by the idea of gender-neutral bathrooms, and we were equally fascinated by his brilliance. There was something spellbinding about this man. Maybe, I thought, it was the way in which his words flowed together so beautifully. He connected the ancient to the present as he explained to us how a person is actually a mask. Eventually, this person wished us a good day and left, but his impact was undeniable. No sooner did he disappear behind one of the corners when I realized he was a professor on campus and a world-renowned scholar. He had a Wikipedia page and an incredible resume to show his prowess. I guess I expected him to come with more pomp and circumstance or an exaggerated stride, his mannerisms alone announcing that he was someone important. But he didn’t. All he had to do was open his mouth. At Princeton, famous scholars and legends are our thesis and JP advisers and professors. We can schedule appointments to meet with them during their one-and-a-half-hour time slots on Mondays and Wednesdays or speak with them after class. The accessibility of these luminaries is really astounding, if you think about it. You read books edited and written by those who grade your papers or ask you to clarify an argument in precept. Most times, I admit, I toggle back and forth between being starstruck and simply looking at these individuals as people who have achieved great things. On one hand, there is the acknowledgment that this is a type of person whom you may not see often. Professors who speak seven languages and go to London and Prague for academic conferences are riding their bikes and grabbing pizzas from Frist just like the rest of us. We hold so much reverence for these people that it can be mind-blowing to be in their vicinity. We are so focused on getting good grades that nothing else matters, including being in the presence of greatness. But I wonder if this focus represents our casual attitudes toward these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for connections or if it exists because we actually look at these people as “our own” within this Ivy campus. After all, this is why we chose Princeton — to be taught by the best. The idea of a person as a mask is becoming clearer to me as I ponder how it relates to both the acknowledgment and nonchalance toward the academic elite. They are people just like us; although we might expect them to be packaged in a certain way, the fact still remains that it is still only an expected outer persona. These professors project themselves to us in the ways they deem fit. Perhaps the amazement comes from the fact that the way in which we see them in academic journals and on the cover of books does not align with the way we see them when they casually walk into class on a Thursday afternoon. It can be difficult to combine our sheer reverence and the idea to “keep it cool” in front of them. But perhaps it starts with just listening to them. Don’t focus too much on the outer people, but rather, hear the passion and mastery of a given subject in their voices. After all, their personalities speak to their characters more than anything else.|~|Morgan Jerkins is a comparative literature major from Williamstown, N.J.

61944|~|Face(book)-to-face|~|   April 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|It’s probably too early for a retrospective. I’m still a freshman, Preview was only yesterday and we have a few weeks to put our labors to rest. Yet as I was reading the late Peter Matthiessen’s The Snow Leopard, which charts his spiritual and physical journey on the Tibetan Plateau, I thought about the ways in which I had improved (or worsened) during my own voyage in and around Old Nassau. My shortcomings are legion, but during this academic year, I’ve also enjoyed a few personal successes. One of the more peculiar changes — deleting my Facebook account — allowed me to begin cultivating some of the characteristics that the University has itself reflected. Deleting my Facebook was more difficult than it probably should have been. I had struggled with the decision for almost a week before clicking the button that erased my virtual identity. We can all agree that there are things infinitely more important than the integrity of my online presence, but for an undergraduate who had enjoyed existing as a green dot on the right side of a screen since middle school, this was significant. Yes, I could easily leave my room and walk one door over to enjoy a face-to-face conversation. But how would people know what was going on with me? How could people confirm that I was happy or bored or glad that summer is almost here? The horrible sway of ego planted in my mind the oddest idea: Keeping my Facebook could ensure that people would think of me, even if my presence were as subtle as a status update or a new profile picture. My “dilemma” was simplified when I acknowledged the simple fact that I am older than Facebook, and there have always been other ways to foster meaningful relationships with peers. In some ways, you might say I was trying to channel Matthiessen. Less ornamentation, more essentials. If it’s not already clear, let me say this: Most people seem to balance social networks and their own identities just fine. But as I became more comfortable at Princeton — more aware of the way it encouraged coffee conversations in Chancellor Green and group runs through quiet subdivisions — I simultaneously became aware that “virtual Aaron” would always be distant from the people with whom he was communicating. Even if I haven’t yet reaped all of its benefits, this step on the first leg of my Princeton journey will have connected me to many people by disconnecting me from a world of virtual personae. It’s not just about taking the time to notice details to which I might not have been receptive before; in many ways, my decision emphasized how my behavior could reflect the environment and types of interactions that the University seems to favor. Because my own experience with Facebook was often time-consuming, living without it has forced a subtle, though substantial, shift in focus. Not only do I seem to have more time, I can also find more fulfilling ways to use it. Humanities-related research is an interest of mine, and this adjustment has placed me in a mental framework that lets me engage in these studies with more enthusiasm and concentration. The University is a relatively small community, and in the frequent silence of studying, this environment offers us each our own mental space in which to reflect or, even more simply, to breathe. The small Tibetan hamlets that Matthiessen described put him in an environment that encouraged personally enriching conversations while also giving him the space he needed to improve himself. Princeton is not that unlike Matthiessen’s Nepal, if we choose to acknowledge it as such. This is less about my experience with Facebook than it is about reimagining the spaces in which we choose to assert ourselves, whether they are mountains, Gothic buildings or websites. My initial fear was that in transferring from one place to another — from Facebook to a more tangible reality — I would lose touch with the people in my social network, and they would lose touch with me. And while that might be true to some extent, I’ve found that the shift has aided my individual growth. Perhaps I have lost a community of hundreds, but now I can dedicate myself more fully to my immediate relationships and academic pursuits. By sacrificing my virtual identity, I am able to focus exclusively on how I want to utilize this space that we all share.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich.

61951|~|"I hate the humanities!"|~|   April 10 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Yotam Sagiv|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|During dinner the other day, I overheard two juniors (presumably STEM majors) complaining about having to take humanities courses. “I hate the humanities!” one of them vehemently spat. “History is so important to computer science,” the other sarcastically replied. Sadly, this is not an uncommon conversation here at Princeton; from die-hard scientists lamenting their Epistemology and Cognition credit to tried-and-true historians railing against their Quantitative Reasoning requirement, the complaint of insufficient academic freedom has reared its head often enough that lamenting its poisonous shadow has become almost a norm. Frankly, this is ridiculous for two reasons. First, the need for exploration is the basis of the liberal arts education system; this particular aspect of the “Princeton syllabus” was never hidden from anyone during application time. In fact, it was advertised. One of the biggest selling points of institutions such as Princeton is that the joy of playing around with previously unconsidered fields is encouraged, rather than asphyxiated by a death-ray focus on a particular concentration. The beauty of such a system becomes much more obvious when you consider alternative educational systems, such as those used in Europe. For instance, in the U.K., the typical student will have essentially picked his major by the age of 16 — A-levels require that you pick only three or four subjects to study during the last two years of high school. If, come college application time, you decide you want to study physics, then you’d better have chosen physics, chemistry and mathematics two years prior. This sort of tunnel vision becomes even more extreme during your time at a university: You do not get to take courses outside of your prescribed major (note that in U.K. schools, you do not declare in your sophomore year; you come in with your concentration already set). If you applied for cognitive psychology and realized you didn’t like it after a few months then too bad — suck it up, or leave and reapply. Princeton allows us to have safety. You can come in a physics major and leave with a degree in comparative literature. We’re given a strong, comfortable safety net in order to ensure our future happiness, and rather than embracing the latitude it gives us, we lash out at its existence. Unfortunately, the bitterness that this perceived absence of freedom has created results in an equal absence of effort in fulfilling the distribution requirements. Rather than attempting to find interesting courses in areas outside their concentration, some students choose the classes that present the smallest challenge or the least time commitment. This misses the point. Sure, it’s entirely possible that students are completely passionate about their chosen majors; this will be the rest of their lives, and the prospect of doing nothing but coding or essay writing or poem translating presents a future ripe with vocational happiness like no other. However, human beings are not one-dimensional creatures. It’s completely possible for you to have a deep desire to master both Java and literary analysis. Searching for a Literature and the Arts credit? Don’t take “Clapping for Credit” because it has a reputation for being easy and low-effort; explore the range of options the music department has to offer and try one that catches your eye. Harder classes force you to actually immerse yourself in the field, to truly grapple with the material that you’re being taught — and it is this fuller sense of experience that will allow you to realize whether you’re interested. Who knows? Maybe you’ll find that you’re a Baroque concerto aficionado (thank you, MUS 226: Instrumental Music: The Concerto). Hunting for a QR? Take COS 126: General Computer Science, or MAT 215: Analysis in a Single Variable; if you don’t like it, the add/drop and pass/D/fail options exist for a reason. If you do find yourself enjoying the class, on the other hand, you’ve opened up another avenue for your own happiness in the future. Because that’s what this is about, after all. The paradigm that underpins the liberal arts education system — the system on which this school is grounded — is that the act of exploration, of hunting through the departments, of scouring through the course listings, of attending lectures on new topics, will ultimately yield a result that will make the entire process worth it. Every seemingly long step in the arid desert of “exploration” will finally be counterbalanced by the joy of uncovering an unexpected oasis in the form of a newly discovered love — a gem extracted from the debris of distribution requirements that is guaranteed to make it all pay off.|~|Yotam Sagiv is a freshman from Tel Aviv, Israel.

61742|~|Taking time off|~|   April 9 2014|~|Columns Mental Health Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Last Sunday, news broke that a sophomore at Princeton was suing the University for disability discrimination after it allegedly made him withdraw from school following a suicide attempt. The decision to essentially kick the student out of the school came after the student apparently took 20 pills of Trazodone, an antianxiety medication, before checking himself into the hospital. Princeton has historically had a convoluted relationship with mental health. Last year marked the first Mental Health Week on campus, where various events about stress, depression and therapy — among other things — attempted to open up a dialogue on campus about this often taboo topic. Despite this, Princeton — along with some other Ivy League schools, including Brown and Yale — has faced criticism for having a harsh policy regarding suicide and depression. Essentially, if the mental health of a student approaches suicidal ideation, the student may be forced to withdraw. In a case such as this one, the rationale behind kicking a student out for mental health issues can take one of two forms: to protect the school’s name or because it’s — according to the University — in the student’s best interest. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that the school is doing this to save the student rather than its own reputation. I’ve met quite a few people at Princeton thus far that, at one point in their academic careers, decided to voluntarily take time off. Usually it’s for a year, but sometimes it’s for a semester. The cited reasons span across the spectrum: health issues, financial burden, overwhelming stress, to work, to qualify for the Olympics. Taking time off of school once you’ve already begun is a big decision, but if it’s voluntary, it’s usually not too big of a deal. The student has weighed the pros and cons extensively and is making a decision that they feel is going to be best for them in the long run. As adults — young adults, but adults, nonetheless — we reserve the right to determine what is and what isn’t in our own best interest. If, however, students are being forced to leave, they are being thrust into a decision without fully accepting all the nuances that come with it. For instance, they won’t be able to graduate on time with their peers. Any post-secondary education plans are further pushed back. They lose an entire semester’s worth of classes and work. Having to deal with this situation is in and of itself enough to spiral someone into a crippling depression. Add, however, to this equation the fact that the reason the student is being kicked out in the first place is because of the crippling depression. Surely that will only exacerbate the problem and in the end be worse for the student. It’s easy to say that depression at college is spurred by any number of things we experience here at college: academic pressure, social pressure, homesickness, isolation, feelings of inadequacy. It’s easy to say that removing people from an environment particularly toxic to them should help them get better. If a student agrees, then by all means they should take a voluntary leave of absence. However, not all students see time off as a light at the end of the tunnel. The reason that this isn’t always the case is because the support system people build in college is usually comprised of their friends, classmates and roommates. Removing them from such an support system might be singlehandedly snipping away the one source of comfort they did have while they were struggling with their problems and would further exacerbate any feelings of isolation or helplessness, both very prominent symptoms of suicidality and depression. Universities, when dealing with cases of suicidal or depressed students, should adopt a more student-centric policy. Efforts should be made to show students all the benefits of taking time off, but they should never feel as though they are being forced into it. If a student doesn’t want to leave, measures should be taken to accommodate them the same way measures are taken to accommodate a physical illness such as a sensory or physical handicap. Students should be allowed a lighter workload or be mandated therapy. Princeton has made some important strides in mental health over the past few years, but this case in particular sheds light on a darker practice that needs some looking over. Students should be allowed to make decisions for themselves because sometimes, the alma mater just doesn’t know best.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

61746|~|Making the most of shortened preview|~|   April 9 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|With the first Preview happening this Thursday and the second one in a few weeks, Preview is certainly hovering in the minds of students and faculty alike. In particular, the administration’s decision to shorten the two Preview “weekends” into Preview “days” has resulted in the need to rearrange schedules and programs in order to accommodate as many events as possible within the greatly reduced span of time that prospective freshmen will be on campus. The pros and cons of the administration’s decision have already been covered fairly extensively, and it seems prudent, instead, to reflect on the ways that the previews can be successful regardless of the relatively late change that shortened Preview so much. USG has already taken steps to make the preview days as indicative of Princeton spirit as possible, arranging such events as the Pre-P-Rade to cheer on the pre-frosh. In addition, the usual key events — namely This Side of Princeton, the activities fair and the keynote speech hosted in Richardson Auditorium in Alexander Hall — will still be taking place. In fact, the main opportunities that visiting potential freshmen lose out on are chances to sit in on multiple classes over the course of several days, but even this shouldn’t be seen as a particular loss. For instance, through online resources such as Coursera and even YouTube, anyone — pre-frosh included — can easily access recordings of video lectures, which provide a reasonable, if not perfect, sense of the academic teaching style of many Princeton lecturers. It is likely reasonable to say that such knowledge — the feel of a class rather than the class material itself — is, in truth, the main takeaway that pre-frosh get from visiting classes. I doubt that second semester high school seniors are likely to be particularly interested in learning about Lagrange multipliers or other concepts that they won’t need to study until they actually enroll in Princeton. Another component that is lost by shortening Preview to only a single day is the chance for pre-frosh to get to know members of their fellow class better, but even this is rectified by the fact that much of the same introductory processes — Hi! I’m (insert name here), from (insert region of hometown), interested in studying (insert major) — are repeated all over again during orientation week that precedes the start of the fall semester. In addition, it can be argued that having prospective freshmen only visit for one day limits their ability to comprehensively tour the campus, but three days really makes no difference either (I recall still getting lost on my way to the Dinky as I prepared to head back to Newark Airport and home) — anyone who claims otherwise must be rather well-endowed with orienteering capabilities. Besides, those who decide to matriculate will have plenty of time to get to know the layout of campus. So what can’t a one day preview do that a three-day preview can? The list is rather short and predominantly consists of offering pre-frosh the chance to experience “dorm life.” But just because they aren’t spending the night doesn’t mean that hosts can’t still give a tour of the dorm facilities. As the saying goes, life is what you make of it, and just because Preview has been shortened doesn’t mean that we can’t work to make it as great as ever. The administration, in seeking to hold the same events as usual, and USG, in starting new, promising traditions, are both working toward a common goal of sustaining Preview’s highlights regardless of the length of the program. In fact, the people who might miss out the most are the hosts, who don’t get to spend as much time with those cuddly pre-frosh (have you seen the picture on the back of the t-shirts given out to hosts?). But that doesn’t mean that hosts are limited to interacting with their charges for only one day — they can easily exchange contact information and continue to guide their respective pre-frosh through the entirety of their college decisions processes. Preview may indeed be shortened, but instead of being seen as a limitation on the program as a whole, it can be seen as a chance to provide an equally positive, albeit highly-condensed, Princeton experience for the visiting pre-frosh, and it is up to the students, hosts and non-hosts alike, to ensure that the visiting prospective members of the Class of 2018 get the most out of their visit.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

61739|~|Colleges and the liability dilemma |~|   April 9 2014|~|Columns Mental Health Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|For the past six months, a Yale junior has been threatened with suspension because of her weight. At 92 pounds and 5 feet 2 inches, Yale Health officials considered her unhealthily underweight, according to an op-ed she wrote for The Huffington Post titled “Yale University Thinks I Have an Eating Disorder.” Despite her arguments that her weight had been stable for years and that she is small by genetics, Yale Health had been requiring weekly weigh-ins and encouraging her to gain weight, she wrote. Although she said she began “stuffing herself with carbs and junk food daily to gain weight”, she only gained two pounds, which was not enough to satisfy Yale Health. Only after publishing the op-ed, writing a letter to the university president and finally getting a chance to meet with a different health professional at Yale, was she able to limit her weekly weigh-ins to once per semester. Afraid of the liability issues that would result from keeping a student with an eating disorder, Yale straightforwardly looked at her body mass index, determined it was lower than was considered normal and asked that she either gain weight or be placed on medical leave. Similarly at Princeton, a student who attempted suicide in 2012 was banned from his classes and evicted from his dorm room, essentially forcing his withdrawal from the University, according to a recent lawsuit filed by the student against the University. The student was deemed unlikely to “pose an imminent risk of harm to himself or others” by the hospital that treated him but ultimately had to withdraw under administrative influence. In the suit’s complaint, he stated that forcing his withdrawal would produce emotional distress and make his condition worse, but “instead, Princeton sought to protect itself from adverse publicity or liability.” These students’ stories are examples of the recent controversies concerning universities and their treatment of mental health. In trying to protect themselves from liability issues stemming from students with mental health problems harming themselves or others, universities often overlook the nuances of each specific case and end up making decisions that exacerbate the students’ problems. As soon as universities identify a certain degree of mental trouble through bright-line measures, they take steps to protect themselves and their reputations, rather than acting to help the student. This is not to say that universities should treat serious mental health issues lightly. In some cases, students present demonstrated danger to themselves or others and should be asked to leave campus. In the Virginia Tech shooting, the student perpetrator had several counseling appointments before the incident indicating continuing problems. One counselor marked “troubled: further contact within two weeks” in the form that rated the severity of his condition, and the student indicated in a second phone conversation with counselors that his depression was persisting, but then refused to follow up. However, the Virginia Tech case shares little in common with the ones mentioned above. Several different medical professionals indicated that the Virginia Tech student was a potential danger to himself and those around him. The Yale student had only consulted with one professional who refused to consider her weight history, and the Princeton student consulted with a hospital that concluded that he was not a danger to himself nor anyone else. Mental health, and consequently, university actions, can’t be dealt with in a binary manner. Each case has its own best course of action, whether that means suspension or monitoring. However, applying suspension as a blanket treatment to signs of mental stress, regardless of the circumstances or severity, is not the solution. In fact, it may hurt more than it helps. The Yale student said that she felt pressure from her school-appointed counselor to overeat and risk developing a binge eating disorder just to assure officials that she did not have a nonexistent one.  When the fear of liability goes too far, universities begin protecting themselves instead of helping the students. Instead of using bright-line tests such as a BMI below a certain threshold or the instance of a suicidal action, universities should adopt a more holistic approach. Perhaps universities can call upon the judgments of multiple professionals instead of just one and consider the judgments of outside professionals, as in the case of the Princeton student, especially when their judgments disagree. Mental health issues operate on a spectrum, and the best course of action should be chosen accordingly – on a case-by-case basis instead of a blanket suspension.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

61586|~|Prefrosh should know more about eating clubs|~|   April 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|Ah, the eating clubs, that uniquely Princeton institution; those sleek, elegant buildings that are the destination of a stately pilgrimage by a huge portion of Princeton Tigers every Thursday, every Saturday and some Fridays too. The eating clubs are tucked neatly out of the way on Prospect Avenue but they loom large in the collective consciousness. They dominate the social scene and whether you decide to join one or you decide to opt out of the system, every Princetonian has to deal with the eating clubs at some point. Keeping that in mind, I think it is important to think about how the eating clubs might appear to prospective students. One major problem is that many prefrosh do not know anything about the eating clubs at all. As one naïve prospective student put it, “I know nothing beyond the fact that eating clubs are social groups.” This reaction is not all that uncommon, and this is concerning. The eating clubs play a large enough role on campus that you ought to have a good understanding of them before you commit to Princeton. With costs that are frequently prohibitively expensive (although the Financial Aid Office does help some students with that) and the tradition of bickering to get in (although some clubs allow you to just sign in), the eating clubs are often the target of severe criticism. They have been accused of discouraging low-income students from coming to Princeton: Princeton is the Iviest of the Ivies and the eating clubs are the Iviest institution of all. A culture so defined by wealth and status might not seem accessible to prospective low-income students. Even if low-income students may be able to join a club with the help of financial aid, they might not feel they have a place in the hyper-privileged culture represented by the eating clubs. After talking to a few recently admitted students, I found that this year’s prefrosh who are already familiar with the clubs are already starting to stake out positions on the issue. One skeptical prefrosh told me, “I’m not interested in joining an elitist exclusionary group.” Although that particular student wasn’t turned away from Princeton by the fact that our social scene can come across as “elitist and exclusionary,” other prospective students might be. If you are not interested in selectiveness in your social life, you might decide not to even apply to Princeton. Although the reality of the eating clubs might differ from their posh appearance, an unwelcoming image is damaging enough. Of course, the flip side of the argument is that the eating clubs’ mystique and air of exclusivity might actually attract other students. Another prospective student told me, “I plan on joining one of the more selective [eating clubs].” It seems, then, that in some cases, the idea of a hard-to-get-into social club might actually be a draw. That raises the question of what sort of students we are attracting to Princeton. Because Princeton is in the Ivy League, it is undeniable that at least some students will be drawn to it primarily for its exclusivity. There is something about knowing you are special enough to get in that many might find appealing. The eating clubs merely take it to the next level — if you are someone who is searching for exclusivity, they can provide an additional layer of it even within one of the nation’s most elite schools. The fact that these students had opinions on it in the first place is a good start given that many prefrosh don’t know anything about the eating clubs. The crucial thing is that students learn more about them before they choose Princeton. As an upperclassman, you will have to choose either to join a club or to buck the tradition. Either way you will be shaping your social life in relation to the clubs. Because of this, prefrosh need to be well-informed about our idiosyncratic dining and social system. An open, frank discussion of the clubs might also help alleviate worries of exclusivity: something especially pertinent to keep in mind as Preview approaches. Hopefully, more transparency about the whole process might help students make more informed decisions about where they go to college, Princeton or elsewhere.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a freshman from Fairfax, Va.

61517|~|Wishing for religion |~|   April 8 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|The earth breathed beneath me, inhaling rain and releasing steam. These exhalations grasped at my legs as I moved by the graveyard, but I continued through the moisture, my eyes trained on the grid of tombstones. Names blurred together through the veil of the humidity, and dates became smudges of lives wiped clean by an inexorable truth. Whenever I tried to focus my gaze, the meaning of the letters danced a little farther away. In that moment, I was not seized by the same type of fear that normally grips me with the arrival of another full week of due dates or expectations. I did not feel that rooted terror at the prospect of losing a friendship following a fight or a misplaced prox or a lack of time to sleep. All those emotions suddenly seemed so banal in the face of death — the one truly universal experience. I block out the prospect of others’ and my mortality on a daily basis, occupying myself with relative trivialities to avoid descending into insanity. That Saturday afternoon spent beneath the weeping sky, however, I allowed myself to consider the questions that form the foundations of almost every major religion. I came to no conclusion, save one. I wish I were religious. Not for some of the reasons that immediately come to mind, however. I don’t want to adhere to the explanations of the afterlife that run throughout the Bible or the Quran or the Vedas or any other holy text, not that I begrudge anyone who does. What I crave is that sense of identity, that organized community to discuss what comes after life, to explore whether or not I believe in a god or many gods, to engage in unifying traditions that transcend my sense of self. Of course, there are realms in which to discuss faith (or lack thereof), and I have in many cases explored my views with friends and family but never in a consistent manner. I see individuals here and at home who identify as Christian or Jewish or Muslim who don’t believe in some of the tenets that are used to define these and other religions, and that is essentially what I yearn for. And there’s nothing wrong with that. At this stage in my life, though, I feel so distanced from these groups by virtue of growing up in a household that never emphasized, and, in fact, eschewed, the idea of religion, that I don’t feel as though I can fully incorporate it into my identity. I can, and do, choose to learn the core principles of different faiths to gain insight into cultures and morality and ways of human thought. But I don’t feel as though I can belong within one. That Saturday afternoon, I thought briefly of entering the church just up the hill, of kneeling before the altar and exploring the far corners of my mind to discern what beliefs and fears lurked there. Aside from the undeniable fact that rain had saturated my very being in the 45 minutes I spent outside, I ultimately rejected that impulse as an intrusion upon a world to which I never have belonged and likely never will belong. I should clarify, however, that this sense of permanence does not stem from any behavior of religious communities on campus or in my home state. In fact, the opposite in most cases is true. My conclusion that I will never be one to join an organized religion derives itself from my own inhibitions that make me feel as though my presence would be an intrusion. Irrational though this thought may be, it is ever-present and pervasive. Perhaps this longing for religion, even in the face of such an “outsider” mentality, is unique to my search for that elusive thing we call our identity. But I doubt it. Even so, I will not excuse it, nor will I suppress it. I will use it as a tool to drive my self-exploration. Maybe someday it will help lead me to my answers for the questions that I faced as I paused to consider life beyond death. Maybe it won’t. But in any case, that desire itself, and its implications as to my core values and priorities, has become a part of my identity as crucial to my sense of self as the names of those individuals I visited that afternoon were to them.|~|Kelly Hatfield is a freshman from Medford, Mass.

61498|~|Letter to the Editor: April 8, 2014 |~|   April 8 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “The willingness to accept the penalty for breaking an unjust law is what makes civil disobedience a moral act and not merely an act of lawbreaking.” While I am currently entangled in a legal battle against an unjust law much different from the one Dr. King was fighting, I strongly believe his words still apply. On Aug. 31, 2013, I was arrested by the U.S. Park Service Police in Philadelphia while attending an event being held at the People’s Plaza, a designated free speech zone directly in front of Independence Hall and right beside the Liberty Bell Pavilion. The purpose of this event was to gather people in a public display of the need to reform the current draconian laws in this country against the personal use of marijuana. I was particularly drawn to this event because of my deep belief that marijuana is a safe, natural alternative to many of the synthetic pharmaceutical drugs prescribed by physicians in this country every day. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, 290 people in the United States are killed by prescription drugs every single day. In the entire recorded history of mankind, there has yet to be the first death linked directly to marijuana. I was charged by the Park Service police with simple possession of marijuana because at the end of this event, I joined with others in the crowd and lit a joint as an act of civil disobedience. On Jan. 27, I finally had my day in a U.S. federal district court, where I was found guilty of the charge against me. At my sentencing on March 26, I was ordered to pay a $3,000 fine and will be on federal probation for the next two years. In addition, I am banned for life from Independence National Historic Park and the Liberty Bell. Despite what I feel was an excessively harsh sentence aimed at silencing activists, I still stand behind my actions and sincerely believe I was doing the right thing. While we technically have a medical marijuana program in the state of New Jersey, the harsh reality is the current program is almost completely unworkable because of the actions of Gov. Chris Christie. Thousands of qualified patients are being denied access to a prescribed medication simply because our governor disagrees with the need for a medical marijuana program and has done everything in his power to block full implementation of this program, which is now five years old. On Dec. 2, 2013, Sabina Rose, a 15-month-old child and a New Jersey resident, died as a result of a massive seizure caused by Dravet Syndrome. Sabina’s doctors had tried treating her condition with conventional pharmaceutical drugs, but, as is often the case with Dravet Syndrome, these drugs provided no relief. Her only hope was one particular strain of medical marijuana that has proved to be beneficial in the treatment of seizures. While Sabina’s parents had completed all of the necessary paperwork and had received all of the required physician sign-offs, her application had not yet been approved by the N.J. Department of Health and Senior Services. Sadly, Sabina’s case is not the only instance of patients losing their lives due to a lack of access to needed medication. On average, 22 military veterans take their own lives every single day in this country. A large percentage of these deaths are a direct result of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, another condition in which medical marijuana has proved to be a safe and reliable form of treatment. Unfortunately, PTSD is not one of the extremely limited number of qualifying conditions allowed under New Jersey’s medical marijuana program. Our brave warriors here in New Jersey are forced to use pharmaceutical drugs to treat their conditions. And as I found out firsthand, these drugs often have devastating side effects, such as causing severe suicidal thoughts and tendencies. Despite everything that has happened to me, I still believe my actions were justified. Sometimes civil disobedience has to be the first resort because courts and legislatures take time, and it is the only way to make anyone care about an unjust law in time to do anything about it. Countless lives are lost every day in New Jersey and across the country as a result of patients being denied access to a medication that can and does save lives.

61328|~|Letter to the Editor: April 7, 2014 |~|   April 7 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|I wanted to know what all the brouhaha was about “Marry Smart,” the book recently written by Susan Patton ’77,  so I bought it as an eBook last week, figuring that I would transfer the least money possible from my bank account to hers (thankfully, my local library did not waste a dime of its budget on the book). To say she gives mixed messages is an understatement. Marriage and career are not, as we have all discovered, mutually exclusive. Like Anne-Marie Slaughter ’80, many of us raised in the 50s and 60s have come to believe that “you can’t have it all,” but I feel like my friends and I have come pretty darn close. Those of us educated in the late 60s and early 70s at Ivy League institutions like Princeton stood on the shoulders of our mothers and grandmothers who went to college and, in some cases, grad school, but graduated with no career opportunities due to their gender. The outstanding women from classes of the 90s I met at the Women in Leadership Conference at the University last week are standing on our shoulders, confident and ambitious, taking the goal of professional and marital success for granted. They chair foundations, practice law and medicine, head divisions of major entertainment corporations, preside over institutions of higher learning and are now sending daughters of their own to Princeton. The undergraduates I met at the conference were confused and offended by Ms. Patton’s message — but more confused than offended, as it’s hard to take a sophomoric self-help book terribly seriously. I’m not surprised. It’s a confusing message, and it took me a while to sort out in my own mind why so, exactly. Apart from the multitude of deeply offensive and simplistic advice and attitudes expressed in her little Miss America-like manifesto, her major claim of somehow representing the women of Princeton University in the 70s just isn’t honest. She simply trades on the fact that she attended Princeton, which therefore qualifies her as an authority on life’s most vexing issues, much the same way that she boasts of having a best friend in college who was a wealthy White Anglo-Saxon Protestant from Fairfield County, Conn. A friend of mine who was the dean of students at a New England preparatory school complained once, “The trouble with so many of the parents I deal with here is that for them [the school] is just another BMW in their garage.”  That says it all.  For Ms. Patton, Princeton, like her Westport wasp, is just another BMW in her garage.  Her fine liberal arts education seems simply a red herring, totally irrelevant to her distasteful drivel. I am a mother and a college health center physician. Adolescence is confusing and challenging enough as is without returning it to the 1940s. Regrettably, Ms. Patton’s mother did not have the opportunity to attend college. She was busy trying to stay alive in a concentration camp. My mother, who attended Vassar College in the early 1940s felt under constant pressure to find a husband from the meager group of men too old or disabled to go off to war, and said she felt like the oldest woman in the world when she married at age 22 and gave birth to me at 25. Ms. Patton needs to speak to some of these women and reconsider her revisionist views of the good old days of  1940s  American collegiate life. If you have issues with intimacy, seek the professional care of a therapist. If you have issues with infertility, go to a reproductive endocrinologist, but please, oh please, do not go to Ms. Patton for any reliable advice whatsoever on how to plan your life during or after Princeton. Sincerely yours, Katherine P. Holden, M.D. ’73 P’13 Litchfield County, Conn.|~|
61332|~|Perfection paradox|~|   April 7 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Azza Cohen|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|When we walk through the FitzRandolph Gate, we walk into a mold — take advantage of all the opportunities Princeton has to offer you. If you’re not happy here, then you’re in the minority. Love it or learn to. We are expected to work hard but not struggle. Get good grades and do a million activities, but also sleep and be social. Time and logistics become elusive friends. It’s a simple inequality — the hours required to excel in class and activities alone tip the scale away from the hours necessary for sleeping and socializing. I call this the “perfection paradox.” My favorite moment this year did not have a grand beginning. I had pulled an all-nighter and showed up to work obviously exhausted, beginning to lose my voice and not subtly wearing the same outfit for two days in a row. I’m not proud. My boss asked, “How are you?” Before I could respond, however, she said something to me that radically changed the way I view this question: “Azza, just take a second. You don’t have to say that you’re feeling great, because you’re great just the way you are.” I find that, when asked how I am doing by family or friends, I catch myself in superficiality. When I call my mom and she asks how things are, I’ll instinctively reply that I’m doing fine, that my classes are great, that my friends are great and that I’m sleeping enough. Usually, however, only three-quarters are true at any given time. I should feel more comfortable casually replying, “Actually, now that you’ve asked, I’m feeling very behind in my classes, am worried that my friend hasn’t called me back, am overwhelmed with work, and am really hoping Firestone has this book that I need for my JP … ” This is usually reserved for a time when I feel truly unbalanced. I don’t believe we need to pour our hearts daily, but I’d like to raise the question: how often do you lose your sincerity by hiding yourself behind an orange-tinted mask of perfection? Mental Health Week is an excellent spark to this conversation — encouraging dialogue is always the first step to addressing any issue. But the conversations I’m talking about are not only the conversations we have with each other, but the conversations we have with ourselves. Why do I feel obligated to tell others that I love everyone and everything and am totally in control, and why do I feel obligated to tell myself too? We are all incredibly accomplished, and, more than that, we are constantly told about how accomplished we are. It’s a natural extension of this pride to feel that complaints are unwarranted, and that we should be able to always easily juggle all the pieces of this Princeton puzzle. We certainly should recognize that we are very lucky, and whenever I leave class inspired by a professor’s passion for teaching, meet an interesting new person or walk past Nassau Hall lit up at night, I feel grateful this is a place I get to call home. And for all those nights I’ve felt sick with worry about finishing a project, for all those hours I’ve spent feeling like I didn’t deserve to be here, for all those class periods I pinched myself to stay awake because I didn’t sleep enough the night before, I feel grateful, too. In these moments too, we are great. We are great when we are exhausted and far too caffeinated. We are great when we are grumpy and ignore our emails. We are great when we check out the Counseling and Psychological Services website or call home or cry. Greatness is not a state, but a process. Perhaps, with this in mind, if you ask me, “How are you?” I can reply, “I’m great!” with absolute clarity. I am great because it’s a gorgeous day, and the snow is finally melting, and I just met with my adviser and feel inspired about an essay, and I’m heading to lunch with a friend; I am great because I am scared about a forthcoming exam and really need a nap, and I’m feeling behind and tired and a little lonely. We needn’t feel stuck in the perfection paradox — for we all are simultaneously fumbling and failing and dreaming and succeeding.|~| Azza Cohen is a history major from Highland Park, Ill.

61392|~|Abolish the SAT|~|   April 7 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Katherine Zhao|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Every university-aspiring high school student has gone through the ritual of spending four hours on a Saturday morning filling in tiny bubbles in a test booklet labeled “The SAT.” With the College Board’s recent announcement of an overhaul to the SAT which will enact changes in the spring of 2016, I was reminded of an important question: should the SAT be required for college admissions at all? Years ago, before the rise of high-powered review courses and coaching sessions that teach students how to take the test, the answer was “yes.” It was a way to level the playing field, to create a standard to balance out every high school’s different and possibly inflated GPA calculations. Now, wealthier students with access to resources that prepare them for the SAT have an advantage over less privileged students, often resulting in discrepancies of hundreds of points. With the former scoring higher than less privileged students of similar standards of aptitude and work ethic, the SAT playing field is no longer level. In my standardized testing preparation experience, most of my friends took an SAT class by the Princeton Review or hired a private SAT tutor. When everyone in the class was benefiting from private instruction, it was hard not to cave into the pressure and sign up for personalized instruction. The SAT has a huge impact in a college admission officer’s evaluation of a candidate. An increase of a hundred points can push a student from outside the normal accepted range to within that range. However, this may not be the best indicator of intelligence or future academic performance, because the SAT score is no longer entirely reflective of a student’s ability. The SAT score may vary due to different methods of preparation, which may be extensive, as parents with the available resources are sending their children to test prep agencies as early as sophomore year of high school. The SAT’s importance is so significant that the ranges of accepted students’ scores are published under admissions statistics, so that potential disadvantaged students with lower scores may not even apply if they are in the lower range of scores. An SAT score is too definitive of a number. Too often people define their intellectual abilities with their SAT score, and measures of other talents pale in comparison to the definitive nature of a numerical score. It puts a numerical stamp on people’s ability to take tests, whereas there is no such definitive measure for other abilities such as musical performance, speaking ability or athletic performance, all of which are important factors for an admission officer to consider when evaluating a candidate. As SAT scores may still provide a (limited) scope of students’ ability across different schools’ grade calculations, they should not be banished across the board. They may still offer some standardizing information to admission officers, and the new SAT is now a better indicator of performance in college classes. Colleges should consider adding an option to make submitting standardized testing scores optional so that submitting scores would only help, and not submitting scores that are lower than the admitted students’ ranges would not cause the student to be evaluated less based on his score. Grades throughout four years of high school would be used as the indicator for future academic performance, as records from four years of hard work are more telling than a single-session three-hour test.|~|Katherine Zhao is a freshman from East Brunswick, N.J.

61134|~|Editorial: Against informal preview hosting |~|   April 6 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Last week, the University announced that the duration of its annual program for prospective students, Princeton Preview, would be shortened to one day. Traditionally held over a span of multiple days, the changes came in response to links between the strain of meningitis present at Princeton and the recent death of a student at Drexel University. In response to these changes, a group of undergraduates has organized an informal hosting system seeking to provide housing for prospective students who wish to extend their time at Princeton beyond the one day provided by an abbreviated Preview. As of April 2, 49 students had volunteered to host on a Princeton University Facebook group. While the Board recognizes the good-faith intentions of these students, we strongly advise against this system of organized informal housing. The University’s decision to shorten Preview, made in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was undertaken in order to mitigate the possibility that prospective students may contract meningitis while here. Despite the vaccination campaigns at the University, it is apparent that meningitis remains a very real and acutely dangerous risk, as tragically evidenced by recent events. It is well documented that the adolescent, college-aged demographic is particularly susceptible to meningitis, and the Board believes that the University’s decision is appropriately prudent. By offering to serve as informal hosts, students circumvent the University’s efforts to promote the health of both incoming students and the University community as a whole. In doing so, they subject their guests to an enhanced probability of contracting meningitis. Having a group of unimmunized students stay in residential buildings across campus in close contact with their hosts engenders a considerable and potentially fatal risk. Prospective students may not be fully informed or aware of the risk and severity of meningitis. Even if improbable, the consequences of contracting the disease are sufficiently grave that every possible precaution should be exercised in order to prevent the further spread of meningitis. Adding to the Board’s concerns about informal hosting, the abridgement of Preview will likely mean that the Street will remain open on the nights surrounding the one-day program. It has traditionally been University custom to have the eating clubs closed while prospective students visit campus. Now that Preview does not extend overnight, it is probable that this will no longer be the case. Given that the mechanism of meningococcal transmission relies principally on contact with bacteria found in the nose or throat, attendance at the clubs will inevitably increase the chance that informally-hosted students engage in high-risk activities. The Board recognizes the logistical and financial difficulties for students who are travelling from abroad, or who had already purchased tickets prior to the University’s announcement of the changes to Preview. We commend the Admission Office for its existing commitment to house preview students off-campus as needed, and we encourage them to implement measures for defraying the costs incurred by students who may have already made previous travel arrangements. Ultimately, while the Board concedes that it is likely beyond the University’s capability to police whether students have decided to house Preview participants, we urge students to reconsider their willingness to serve as informal hosts in light of the broader and potentially dangerous implications of such a decision.|~|
61183|~|Letter to the Editor: April 6, 2014|~|   April 6 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Dear Editor, The opinion piece “Can we welcome the students we say we want?” discusses Princeton’s strong commitment to a pioneering financial aid program that helps students from all economic backgrounds and makes it possible for us to make progress toward increasing diversity. I would like to illustrate the extent of the progress we have already achieved and our intentions for the future by sharing a number of facts about our financial aid program that are perhaps less well-known or understood. Pell grants are often used as a yardstick for measuring a school’s commitment to low income students. Public data about Pell percentages are released by the government in a two-year lag, and therefore don’t show in finer detail some of our recent progress. A decade ago, a typical entering class would have approximately seven percent Pell students. More than 14 percent of the current freshman Class of 2017 receive Pell grants. While we recognize that there is much more to be done, we believe that doubling the percentage of Pell students is an excellent start. We expect the next freshman class to include an even higher percentage of Pell recipients, though it is far too soon to know the specific number. The government’s published data will take some time to reflect these increases, but we are already seeing the results of the commitment we’ve made to improve the matriculation of Pell students and we will track our efforts from year to year very closely. Defining what constitutes low or middle incomes, and using a benchmark that is factually consistent, can be confusing. For example, it is easy to assume that our most generous aid packages are limited to families from the lowest or first income quintile. However, at Princeton and several of our peers, the most generous packages (which ask parents to contribute little or nothing toward college costs) extend to families earning up to $65,000, about the bottom of the fourth quintile. While these families might not meet any external standard of poverty in America, such as Pell grants, and many are above the national median income, we recognize that their ability to find discretionary resources to pay for college is extremely limited. These are in fact the middle-class families for which the opinion piece expresses concern about falling through the cracks, which does not happen at Princeton. Because the cost of an education is high, our aid program helps families in the higher quintiles as well, on a proportional basis using financial need as the scale. This chart gives a more complete picture of who qualifies for aid in the Class of 2017. Our outreach to students from all economic backgrounds is an important factor in diversifying the applicant pool and matriculating students, and it is therefore crucial that we get the right message out. Middle-income students should not be discouraged because they think they won’t qualify for the “low income” package. In fact our aid program makes Princeton more affordable for low- and middle-income students than a less expensive state college, and Princeton might well be by far their best option financially.

61190|~|Defending Kwasi Enin|~|   April 6 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|On March 27, students from across the country heard back from Ivy League colleges about whether they were accepted or not. Among them was Kwasi Enin, a 17-year-old student from William Floyd High School in Long Island, who got accepted to every single Ivy League school. Knowing the extreme amount of luck and skill it takes to get into just one, the fact that Kwasi was able to get into one, let alone eight, is an incredible achievement. Unfortunately, some saw this event as an opportunity to deride and discredit him, rather than to celebrate his gifts and talents. From USA Today to TFM, many commenters obsessed over Kwasi’s race or immigrant status. Without even getting to know who he was, the commenters felt this was an open invitation to dismiss his acceptances as a product of affirmative action, based on the fact that he didn’t get perfect SAT scores or wasn’t ranked number one in his class. USA Today News did little to show us who Kwasi the person was. Unlike the New York Post, which posted a copy of his admissions essay online detailing his passion for music, USA Today gave a list of extracurriculars, some class grades and a quote about his desire to study medicine. In the process, we never get the opportunity to learn why Kwasi is unique. Instead, we just get a list of statistics that ignores any of his potential holistic qualities. By reducing him to only his class rank or SAT scores, these commenters opened up harsh criticisms based on superficial qualities. Even worse, USA Today unnecessarily brings up his ethnicity. College admissions expert Katherine Cohen, who USA Today quotes in their piece, perfectly characterizes this issue when she claims that part of his uniqueness is that “[h]e’s not a typical African-American kid.” When describing his stats, USA Today mentions that his score of 2250 “puts him in the 99th percentile for African-American students.” How about the 99th percentile for all students? Isn’t this an extreme accomplishment for any individual regardless of their race? However, even though getting a 2250 for anyone is a difficult achievement, criticizers have found fault in his lack of a perfect score. Hell, I’m an Asian-American who got 2210 on my SAT. Despite the 40-point difference, my acceptance was not littered with shocks of surprise or comments from others about how I did not “deserve” to get in. Additionally, USA Today later decided to remove Cohen’s quote in the original article without comment or mention of their revision (which can be found here, on a copy of the original piece). This is an example of shoddy reporting at its worst. Sweeping these views under the rug or censoring them without explanation is not only poor reporting, but also tries to cover up and hide the flaws of the world that we live in today. Overall, when we use this rhetoric, we create this expectation that African-American students are incapable of being phenomenal, that this fantastic achievement was only special by virtue of his race. However, it is even worse when we try to pretend that these views and beliefs do not exist within our society. An unfortunate reality of the world we live in today is that racism exists. While all steps should be taken to reduce it, by ignoring it those of us who do not hold these views do the opposite — we pretend that there isn’t a problem at all. All in all, we really do not know much about who Kwasi Enin is, nor what his entire application looked like. We are not the Ivy League admissions boards, and trying to validate or dismiss his merit based on a few articles is a ridiculous mistake. That being said, congratulations to Kwasi and to all of the other lucky students who got accepted to their dream colleges. Be ready for some of the greatest years of your lives. Don’t let the assumptions of others undermine you and your accomplishments.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu.

60995|~|The fallacy of freedom |~|   April 3 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|At Princeton, it is widely professed and strongly emphasized that it is all right to be undecided during your first two years of study. As a freshman and then sophomore with conflicting passions and divergent skills that did not seem to fit neatly into any singular area, I took this mantra to heart. Thus explains my brief love affair with American politics and a momentary brush with psychology. I tried audio journalism with the vague notion that my future could very well include a job at NPR and found it most certainly did not. I entered several classes with the optimistic conviction that this would be the semester I found the field or the topic that would propel me in the direction of some one true passion I had yet to recognize. Unfortunately, I was more successful in finding things I did not want to do than things I did. But, as my mother never failed to remind me, knowing what you don’t like can be just as important as knowing what you do, so these were not wasted credits, but chances for self-exploration. The joy of a liberal arts education is that one can afford to study broadly — take courses that intrigue and excite —without being limited to one department from the outset. It was this freedom that, in large part, made my decision to come to Princeton so easy. Here, I could be undecided and be successful all the same. And this is true. But not entirely true. The philosophy should be marked with an asterisk. The fine print — which only as a junior do I realize is tacked to the worn, optimistic phrase — should read, “It is okay to be undecided, but it is better to figure it out early.” It seems a rather obvious point but nonetheless one that is constantly brushed aside in favor of creating a comforting, albeit idealistic, environment for the indecisive freshman. In reality, prerequisites, departmental requirements and funding for independent study become much easier to accomplish given the advantage of time, and this should be made clear early on. The consequence of my years of “exploration” became quite clear this past semester in planning to apply for the Creative Writing thesis through the Lewis Center for the Arts. The Lewis Center’s Program of Study states, “Candidates for the certificate normally take two 200-level courses in creative writing by the end of sophomore year and two 300-level courses by the end of junior year…” This demands that a student know by mid-way through the second semester of his freshmen year — when the application process for the following semester’s courses takes place — that he would like to apply for a Creative Writing thesis two years later. The website does say that “a portion of this requirement may be waived in unusual circumstances,” but the fact remains that students who did know they were planning to pursue Creative Writing right away look far better among the applicant pool. Unfortunately, my late entrance into the program in the fall of my sophomore year combined with my semester abroad and, sadly, a rejection from CWR 345: The Writer’s Room prevented me from fulfilling even three of the four required courses, and I decided not to apply. At first, I considered my situation a unique one, but in talking to other students with Creative Writing aspirations it became clear that many had not been able to complete the thesis prerequisites and were, thus, concerned about the strength of their application or did not apply at all. And the issue is not limited to academic departments. When applying for research funding, students must cite their qualifications, including past coursework. Students who have been working toward a topic or within a specific field beginning early in their Princeton career are certainly better off than those who spent their time studying disparate topics that may not be applicable to one eventual focus. The system perpetuates a self-fulfilling cycle in which those who began their journeys early have the most experience, therefore qualify for courses or funding that allow them to explore their specific interest further, thus gaining more experience and thus being more qualified for the following year’s funding application, and so on. If the University wants to encourage freedom to explore as an underclassman, then it must either do away with limiting prerequisites and qualifications or, more realistically, be honest with its students. In truth, I was always going to be an English major. My exploring had to do more with finding what my older relatives refer to as a “practical major” and avoiding English, rather than being completely directionless. I just simply was not 100 percent sure of that decision and I was looking for some sort of certainty. However, the fact of the matter is I wasn’t 100 percent sure two years later when it came time to actually choose the major either. But I do believe that if someone had frankly explained early in my academic career that a firm decision early in my studies would be put me in better standing for the future, I would have picked my path much sooner. Of course, there are those who do need that time of exploration to find their passion and I by no means want to strip these students of that opportunity. The liberal arts system does not need to adopt the British model of selecting a track immediately upon acceptance to be a more effective one. However, it does need to do away with an idealistic, enabling mantra that does not hold up entirely in the long run.

61022|~|Shortening preview is the right call|~|   April 3 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In light of recent coverage of the administration’s decision to eliminate the overnight component of Princeton Preview and shorten it to two one-day events, I think it’s necessary we remind ourselves of the framework in which this decision was made. Even though we at Princeton love to joke about and downplay the importance of the meningitis outbreak, in reality it’s a serious enough issue to warrant this decision. This is not to say that the decision isn’t unfortunate — just that it’s not unwise. Drawing parallels to the geographic bias of Tiger Tuesday, I do think that we’ll see fewer people commit to Princeton for the Class of 2018 from the West, from abroad, etc. this year as it is completely logical not to want to commit to a place you’ve never visited. Concern over the overall yield is therefore warranted as well. However, even if the yield and the admissions rate are the administration’s top goals regarding future classes, this decision is a safe one. Operating much like insurance, the policy change for this year acts as a safety net and cushions against a massive drop in the yield were — God forbid — something terrible to happen. Princeton is wise, deciding against hosting an overnight Preview while meningitis is still a significant concern and possibly having the worst happen: A visiting student dies or becomes gravely ill. That would be the nightmare scenario, and again, from the perspective of yield, would decimate Princeton’s ability to get accepted students to say yes and commit for the next several years. But obviously there is more than just the yield perspective to consider. Whether one views it as cynical liability-minimization or morally-driven concerns for visitor safety, the University is also clearly trying to minimize the risk to visiting students for their sake. It would be selfish to allow unvaccinated students to visit in droves and stay in hosts’ dorms, while — given the recent and tragic death of a Drexel student who contracted meningitis after contact with Princeton students — putting their health in legitimate risk, all to get more people to commit to Princeton. This is especially true considering that while the herd-immunity threshold was met by the eligible population, a significant swath of the Princeton community was not eligible to be vaccinated in the first place. While the administration appears to have decided not to disallow the Informal Student Hosting group started through Facebook, I don’t see this as evidence that they were motivated exclusively by liability-minimization. Given that the stated goal of the group is explicitly not to “plan our own Preview,” it is simply unfeasible to forbid students from offering to host prospective student visitors, without commensurately banning students from hosting any out-of-town visitors at all. Had the administration wanted to protect visitor safety to the degree that they would disallow this initiative, they would have had to forbid prospective students from staying on campus overnight entirely, which seems both unfeasible and drastic (given they’ve not similarly banned all visitors in the past few months, when meningitis was of equal or greater concern). So while it does have the added benefit of minimizing liability to the University administration in case something does happen to a visiting prospective student, I don’t think this was necessarily the only or the principal motivating factor behind the decision to allow students to informally host prefrosh. So in short, while I, like most people, am upset about the decision to shorten Preview, I think that while unfortunate, it was not unwise or unwarranted. My point here is not that we shouldn’t feel upset about the shortened Preview, but that we shouldn’t conflate that disappointment with a sense that something wrong was done.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

61059|~|Placing our self-worth in our grades|~|   April 3 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|What makes us happy? Certainly, this is a question that has frustrated philosophers, psychologists, doctors and just about everyone else since the dawn of time. While finding what makes us happy may be difficult, finding what makes us unhappy is a much easier task. Kelly Hatfield wrote an excellent piece the other day highlighting the many mental health issues that pervade this campus. I was struck by the statistic that over 40 percent of students on this campus have reported experiencing depression while at this school. And here I thought it was just me. As I think about it more, I can’t be surprised that this is true. The fact of the matter is Princeton students put too much emphasis on academics in their pursuit of success and happiness. It’s unhealthy, especially in an environment like Princeton. There is a contradiction in the way the University handles academics. To make it here, you have to care about superficial representations of your work ethic and abilities — grades, SATs, extracurriculars. You have to strive to be the best and set yourself apart from your peers. You have to love the feeling of being praised and rewarded for your hard work. It takes a very gifted individual to casually drift through high school and find themselves sitting among the best students in the country. And yet, is this really a healthy way to live your life, to make your happiness contingent upon being better than the person next to you? When everyone wants the same thing, can we ever all be happy? Oddly, I don’t come from a family that pushes academic success as a measure of personal value. My parents have always told me that whatever I choose to do with my life, they would support me no matter what. Yet, somehow, somewhere, I tricked myself into believing that academic superiority was the key to my happiness. Nobody ever told me that I had to go to an Ivy League school, but still it was always my dream for as long as I can remember. Somewhere along the line, I began equating academic success with self-worth. Very early on in grade school, I was selected for my district’s gifted education program. During a time in my life when friendships and popularity came hard for me, I was told I was “special,” and it made me feel valued as an individual. I may not have been the popular kid, and I certainly was not the athletic kid, but at least I was the smart kid. Although this sounds like the cliché plight of the unpopular child, I believe this played an important role in my valuation of academics early in my life. Fast forward a decade and I find myself at Princeton. What seems like an affirmation of my success and self-worth has turned into a turbulent and stressful time in my life that has legitimately made me question what I value. I believe this is at the heart of many of the mental health issues on this campus. People become infatuated by the concept of success, and success here means being the best. Of course, being the best at Princeton is next to impossible, no matter the measurement. Why is grade deflation largely considered the greatest threat to mankind since the plague?  Simply put, it restricts access to what every Princeton student has made central to his or her self-worth. People tell me I shouldn’t compare myself to others so much, but how can I not? I have an addiction, an addiction to superiority. It’s how I am where I am today. It is how most Princetonians are where they are today, and it’s unhealthy. More importantly, I don’t know if it’s even possible to change, to learn to look past these unimportant measures of self-worth, because it is so deeply engrained in how we define ourselves. That is the unfortunate truth about elite institutions like Princeton. So here I am, sitting at the finish line of the last ten years of hard work, suffering from an existential crisis and frantically looking for something with which I can measure my own self-worth. For a while, I believed that coming to Princeton may have been a bad choice for me. Maybe I would have been better off going to a largely uncompetitive school, working hard and finding myself again near the top of the food chain. But now I know that would have been a poor choice. Eventually, the use of grades to superficially measure my value will end as I move into the real world. I will be forced to move on and compare myself by some other superficial and irrelevant metric, like income or occupation. Eventually, I would have to face the fact that life isn’t about being the best. Better this happened sooner rather than later. So then, just what is life all about? Psh, don’t ask me. I’m not a philosopher.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pa. He can be reached at cjw5@princeton.edu. 
60893|~|Can we welcome the students we say we want? |~|   April 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|This column is the third in a series about socioeconomic diversity and low-income students at the University. By Stanley Katz I have learned much and agreed with the two long opinion pieces written by Bennett McIntosh and Lea Trusty, so there is no need for me to rehearse what they have said so nicely about the University’s efforts to increase socioeconomic diversity in recent years. For those of us on the faculty who have long hoped that Princeton would do more to increase the full range of diversity among the student body (and of course among the faculty), it has been heartening to see the initiative that former University President Tilghman launched at the end of her term and now its continuation under University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83. But of course none of us should forget the importance of both the sweeping financial aid reform undertaken by former University President Harold Shapiro GS ’64, which eliminated loans as part of student financial aid packages. The combination of financial aid generosity — made possible by our enormous material resources — a superb admissions office and the commitment of our leadership to seek a more diverse student body has positioned Princeton nicely to make progress toward diversity. We all recognize that despite our financial aid package, the University has struggled to increase the number of Pell Grant-eligible undergraduate students. Money alone cannot solve the problem. As Caroline Hoxby pointed out in her article “The Missing “One-Offs”: The Hidden Supply of High-Achieving, Low Income Students,” convincing the students we seek to apply to institutions like Princeton is equally important. And, alas, convincing this cohort of students that Princeton is the elite campus they most want to be accepted by is a daunting problem. We will of course benefit from the national effort under way to attract “undermatched” students (those who are highly qualified but do not apply to highly competitive colleges). But why should those students think that Old Nassau is the place for them? I hope I will be forgiven for thinking of this as the “Michelle Obama” problem. We have recently gotten a lot of mileage from the fact that Mrs. Obama ’85 mentioned that our financial aid policies enabled a student like her to attend the University. But it seems also to be the case that Mrs. Obama has little desire to reconnect with her alma mater. Her undergraduate thesis apparently made clear the difficulties she felt in accommodating herself to the Princeton of her era, and I am afraid that it is likely that her feelings of hurt have not gone away over the years. Whatever the causes of her feelings as an undergraduate, I think we all need to be concerned that students who are “different” than the stereotypical, clubbie Princetonian will think that we are the right place for them. The issue is partly what we will have to do to make a much wider socioeconomic range of students feel comfortable and productive here. Expanding and continuing to improve the Freshman Scholars Institute is surely one such thing. Supporting the sorts of new groups mentioned by Lea Trusty to provide support for first-generation-in-college students may well be another. But I think the problem is more basic. Most obviously, can an elite college in which the majority of the students take their meals and organize their social lives around expensive and sometimes exclusive clubs expect students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to feel that they will be welcome here?  I doubt it. Indeed, although Princeton was the college I dreamed of attending as a (quite well-off) public high school student in Chicago in the 1950s, once I looked into what Princeton student life was actually like, I decided that Princeton was not the place for me. I went to a college that seemed to me to be more welcoming for a student like me, and I feel confident that I made the right choice at the time. That was my “Michelle Obama” experience. Finally, there is an additional problem that seems to me both challenging and very difficult — attracting more students from the lower middle classes. Our financial aid policies now make it quite possible for the economically most deprived students to afford Princeton. Those who come from the lowest quintile of family wealth, if academically qualified, can afford to matriculate. But if their families are in the second lowest quintile (or certainly the middle quintile), they may be priced out of our market. Addressing that inequity will be a daunting challenge even for an institution as remarkably well-heeled as Princeton is. I do not know how we can meet this challenge, but I think it needs to be on our wish list. We don’t want to be a place for the rich and poor, do we? My concern is that we continue to make Princeton a college that is welcoming and attractive to the widest cohort of undergraduate students. We have made great strides in that direction over the more than 60 years since I decided not to apply, and I am proud to be a member of an academic community that has come to take its social responsibilities so seriously. Our decision to create, and then expand, the residential college system was, to my mind, the single most tangible step necessary to move us in the right direction. But we have much more to do before we sleep.|~|Stanley Katz is a lecturer with rank of professor in the Wilson School and the director of the Princeton University Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies.

60890|~|Please stand by|~|   April 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Cameron Langford|~|None|~|If “Princeton Mom” Susan Patton ’77 is right about anything, it’s that the hookup culture on college campuses has a dark side. Where she goes wrong is vesting the responsibility for sexual assault entirely in young women, whom she thinks shouldn’t allow themselves to be “preyed upon” by drinking to excess. Patton’s comments come at a time when both Princeton and universities across the country are formally doubling down on alcohol-based sexual violence, but they reflect an attitude still prevalent across college campuses — that the responsibility for rape lies not with the rapist but with the intoxicated. Such an attitude creates a culture in which “boys will be boys” is a good enough excuse for alcohol-induced assault and perpetrators are wrongly relieved of their responsibility for their criminal actions. This ethos harms more than just victims, who out of a belief they were responsible are often too ashamed to report their attacks. It underpins a broader party culture in which the joys of drinking are shared, yet drinking’s consequences are seen as unfortunate but unavoidable personal mishaps. If the problem is shared, so too should be the solution. That is why increased bystander intervention — or its colloquial counterpart, cockblocking — is a far preferable solution to Patton’s motherly advice that women watch out for themselves. Yesterday, Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education peers wrote a Letter to the Editor detailing the ways students might put bystander intervention in practice. In this column, I hope to explain why putting their steps into practice is the best way to reduce on-campus rape. A clear reason in favor of bystander intervention is simply that people behave better when they know they are being watched. The key to reducing sexual assault, then, is to apply pressure from the outside rather than relying on the internal moral compasses of these young men, who, according to campus rape researcher David Lisak, are often repeat offenders. The President agrees: In January, after assembling a task force on college sexual assault, he implored, “I want every young man in America to feel some strong peer pressure in terms of how they’re supposed to behave and treat women.” Moreover, in an alcohol-sodden environment like the Street, where students’ level of intoxication ranges from near-sobriety to incoherence, bystanders are often better equipped to thwart a would-be attacker than the victims themselves. The idea is to reduce sexual assault by empowering those most able to judge what pop star Robin Thicke would call “blurred lines,” which provide an opening for assault. As one male student (not from Princeton) who drunkenly assaulted a friend recounted, “Alcohol loosened us up and the situation occurred by accident. If no alcohol was consumed, I never would have crossed that line.” Often, drunkenness is clearest to an outside observer, particularly when both parties are consuming alcohol. And given that when women do attempt to demonstrate disinterest, it is frequently through what one study calls evasive tactics, rather than an explicit “no,” outside intervention might sometimes be necessary to translate a nonverbal rejection into reality. This is not to paint women as helpless, disempowered creatures incapable of making their own decisions. But it is to acknowledge that young women are making decisions about how much to drink within a system that encourages they drink to excess and then refuses to share in the consequences. If other students are prompting the binge drinking that has become commonplace on college campuses, then it seems only natural that they also seek to reduce the risk associated with such environments. After all, such an environment is safer for everyone, ensuring both that drunk women won’t be taken advantage of and that drunk men won’t find themselves guilty for a crime they never meant to commit. Some, including the dissent in Monday’s editorial, have urged instead for Patton’s approach of increased personal responsibility on the part of women. Few would deny the empirical fact that drinking to excess carries health risks for women, sexual safety chief among them. In fact, if I had a daughter, I might give her common-sense safety advice that sounds rather like Patton’s: drink moderately, travel in pairs at night. But it is not productive to suggest that being drunk therefore makes women blameworthy for their own assaults. By ignoring the responsibility of the perpetrators, arguments like Patton’s do nothing to solve the real root of the problem: there will always be men who will take advantage of drunk women, and there will always be women drunk enough to be taken advantage of. Targeting these men, not blaming individual victims, ought to be our goal. If we want to reduce sexual assault on campus and make Princeton a safer place for all, it will take a village.|~|Cameron Langford is a politics major from Davidson, N.C.

60716|~|Where are the artists?|~|   April 1 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|My mother was an artist. She went into college as an artist and came out of it as one. At no point did she second-guess this career because of dips in the economy, cautionary tales of the struggling artist or the expansion of departments in “usable” majors. At no point did she doubt herself and acquire a backup. However, I grew up always making sure I had a safety net, as if I were afraid of the next fall. Regrettably enough, I’ve found that this is the case for many Princeton students. Why is it that so many students fear the “no-guarantee” pathway even if that risk might be right for them? Why is it that so many Princeton students shy away from visual arts, music, philosophy and creative writing or at best, say they’d only pursue these subjects through extracurricular activities, rather than more professional means? Can we really consider it wise and advisable for students to make their passions their backups if their “real” jobs don’t pan out? From speaking with second-generation immigrant students, I’ve heard stories of their parents pursuing bold careers in the arts and humanities in their own countries, only to direct their children toward more secure futures. While I completely understand this desire for their children to have financially stable lifestyles post-college, I worry that this mentality will produce an entire generation of workers in the corporate, law and medical industries, and not a single artist or intellectual to be seen. I consider my college experience to be somewhat of an equalizer. To a certain extent, I’ve been able to get financial aid for projects and international trips that would be beyond my family’s income, receive the same education as the kid whose father once worked on the board of a Fortune 500 company and make a decent number of connections at and outside this institution. So why do I still have money on my mind? Why do I associate certain jobs with poverty if many people in these professions have been successful? After all, if someone in this world has to make money from being an artist, writer or philosopher, why can’t it be me? The American Dream supposes that through hard work, you can succeed at what you’re good at, so why does “what I’m good at” have to be restricted by jobs in economics, medicine or STEM? Shouldn’t the Dream leave space for students to create new niches instead of merely filling out pre-made positions? I realize that this might be asking for an ideal, but maybe this is what the University needs to do if it’s “in the nation’s service.” Just from logging on, we can see so many examples of young entrepreneurship — of people wanting to connect with people in new ways that wouldn’t have happened unless some person had taken a chance on an idea. They redefined limits and used their talent and ingenuity to create space for their work. In this way, the leaders of startup companies have made entrepreneurship become a reasonable career choice, something that might not have been so readily pursued a few years ago. Perhaps encouragement of trailblazing can be applied to other fields as well. We should consider that if students are so scared of pursuing certain majors, then the University should provide additional support to encourage learning and development of skills in these areas. This could include providing professions advising tailored for liberal arts majors, offering less competitive funding opportunities for research projects and holding panel discussions with professors and professionals in those fields. If the University caters so successfully to certain majors, the support should be distributed across the board. After all, we should be nurturing students to allow them to demonstrate exceptional proficiency in the arts and humanities. Such skills should not be left vulnerable to societal beliefs of what a successful career is.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif. She can be reached at igomes@princeton.edu. 
60718|~|How to respond to the Susan Pattons of the world|~|   April 1 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|As we are well aware, Susan Patton ’77 has been very outspoken in her views about women, hooking up and sexual assault. On several occasions, Ms. Patton has blamed victims and described perpetrators as relatively unaccountable for the acts of violence they perpetrate. We acknowledge that Ms. Patton has an opinion vastly different from our own and recognize that Ms. Patton and those who share her views contribute to an environment that tolerates sexual violence and discourages otherwise caring community members from intervening when they notice problematic behavior. Multiple persons, including our faculty, have taken a stand to correct the social norms and to encourage our community to more actively support victims and challenge the harmful sentiments espoused by the Susan Pattons of the world. As Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education peers, we are grateful for the course correction initiated by the faculty and seek to add to the conversation by giving our campus community the critical tools needed to achieve our universal goal of preventing sexual violence. While we acknowledge that “risk reduction” techniques that encourage individuals to take action to protect themselves have their place in this discussion, we also recognize that an individual will never be able to completely protect him or herself because it is perpetrators who choose to commit acts of violence. As SHARE peers, we are aware that sexual assault experiences vary greatly. However, a common theme for many victims is the overwhelming feeling that they are to blame for their own victimization. This sentiment stems from being told by family, friends, media and individuals in positions of power in their lives to be careful and not to “drink too much” or “dress too sexy.” When they become victims, they are so burdened by self-blame that they are inhibited from reporting their sexual assaults and/or seeking support and resources. Ultimately, this dangerous socialization allows perpetrators to continue violating others unchecked. As clearly demonstrated by the high numbers of individuals who experience sexual assault, risk reduction techniques and the notion of reminding people to be careful are NOT effective prevention methods. Instead, we must focus on what research and best practice standards have shown actually prevents problematic behaviors: bystander intervention. It is important to know that there are many ways to intervene that fit any personality and situation. We teach the “3 Ds of Intervention”: direct, delegate and distract. Direct intervention refers to confronting the situation head-on. If, after evaluating the situation, you determine that it may not be in your best interest (e.g., for personal safety reasons or other social pressures) to handle it on your own, you can delegate or find another person who is better positioned to intervene. A distraction interrupts the escalation of the conflict so either the perpetrator or potential victim has their attention diverted, and one party is removed from the situation. Since language, like victim blaming or sexist statements, can contribute to the perpetuation of violence, we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent the spread of these harmful ideas. When addressing language, direct intervention is often the best approach. A direct intervention can range from explaining to someone why their language is damaging to simply saying, “Hey, that’s not cool.” By directly addressing a person’s language (in a non-shaming way), the person gets an opportunity to reflect upon the power of their words and the impact on others, allowing them to choose their words more cautiously in the future. When situations are escalating toward violence, however, any one or combination of these techniques can be used. For example, if you are on the Street, and one of your friends or peers seems uncomfortable with another’s behavior toward them on the dance floor, or they have had too much to drink to make a conscious and voluntary decision about how to end their night, you could: (1) directly intervene by telling your friend their dance partner “isn’t into it” or check-in to see if your friend needs help escaping; (2) delegate by asking one of the club’s officers or bouncers to help you intervene; or (3) distract either party by coming up with an excuse or interruption that will remove one of the parties from the situation by requesting to talk to, get a drink with or go to the bathroom with either the perpetrator or potential victim. If in doubt about how an individual is feeling or their level of intoxication, it never hurts to check-in and ask, even if you don’t know that person. If worst comes to worst, someone is a little rude, and you continue on enjoying your night. The brief discomfort you might experience is a small trade-off for being able to potentially prevent someone’s friend and loved one from experiencing an act of sexual violence, perpetrating an act of sexual violence or experiencing an uncomfortable and unwanted encounter. More often than not, people get thanked for looking out for each other. At the end of the day, we get to decide what happens on our campus. Will we turn away from the problems, allowing sexual violence to continue, or actively contribute to a campus environment that is intolerant of violence, supportive of victims and holds perpetrators accountable for their behavior?

60715|~|Editorial: Standardize thesis deadlines|~|   April 1 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|April is now upon us, which means one thing to the masses of bleary-eyed seniors who fill Firestone Library: Thesis due dates are drawing near. But while some seniors have already finished writing their theses, had them bound and turned them in, others have over a month to go until their due dates. Traditionally, each department has decided its own due date. As a result, due dates range from late March to early May. The Board believes that the lack of a standardized thesis date is detrimental to the thesis writing process, class unity and the senior year experience and therefore proposes implementing one due date for all senior independent work. While deadlines for junior independent work also vary, this is less problematic. For one, there is more variation across departments when it comes to junior papers; while some departments require one, others require two. Senior independent work is more normalized in that nearly every A.B. department requires one thesis. In addition to this, senior independent work is a more defining experience, and thesis due dates affect senior class attitudes and unity in a way that does not apply to juniors, as explained below. One practical reason for a standardized thesis deadline is that it will increase awareness of when theses are due. Throughout the year, both seniors and professors can express confusion about their theses deadlines. Each department’s due date can change from year-to-year, especially because they are often based on days of the week, rather than days of the month. In addition to this, the time of day at which theses are due varies by department. Professors may also be unaware of their advisees’ due dates because they have a full schedule of teaching and research in addition to advising, so it is not their only priority. When seniors and their advisers are unaware of due dates, it is clearly detrimental to the seniors’ progress. If there were one standardized date and time at which all theses were due, all seniors and advisers would be on the same page and would be able to remind each other of the deadline, leading to increased awareness. Another reason to implement a standardized thesis deadline is that it is fairer. As an example, each semester, Dean’s Date sets one deadline for all students’ written work. This promotes fairness because everyone has the same amount of time to complete his or her work. With one thesis deadline, each senior would have an equal amount of time both to complete work and to enjoy post-thesis life. Recognizing that there is a difference in the amount of time and possible setbacks to science concentrators required to conduct a lab experiment and produce conclusions than, say, a history major who has the liberty of creating a steady work schedule, the Board recommends a mid-April deadline that is between the current due date extremes. As Dean’s Date does for all undergraduates, a single thesis deadline would increase encouragement and a sense of unity among members of the senior class. On Dean’s Date, there is a pervasive sense that we are all in it together, and students encourage one another as they work. A uniform thesis deadline would do the same thing for the senior class. One deadline would also promote unity after theses are turned in. As it stands, the senior class is very divided during the second half of the spring semester: Some are hard at work on theses, while others can relax and enjoy the end of their time at the University. If all theses were due on the same day, seniors would be united. When theses are turned in, seniors finally have the opportunity to immerse themselves in their coursework, bond with their classmates in enjoying their last few weeks at the University and practically prepare for their life transition. As it stands, it is unfair that some seniors with very late thesis due dates have little time to complete their Dean’s Date work and study for finals. In addition, the fact that some seniors are working on their theses longer than their peers and thus not spending time bonding with their senior friends is a detriment to the senior experience. The one potential problem with a standardized deadline is the stress that it will put on the organizations that provide binding services, as there are only a few places in town that do this. However, with more organization and planning in advance, it should be feasible for these businesses to have all theses bound by the deadline. The Board does not believe that concerns about local businesses should play a large role in shaping the University’s academic policies, especially because a standardized deadline would significantly strengthen seniors’ independent work experiences and sense of community. While thesis dates currently vary by academic department, there is no convincing reason for this tradition to continue. A single thesis deadline would create a fairer, more unified and overall better experience for all seniors.|~|

60489|~|Dishonorable|~|   March 31 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ali Akram Hayat|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The Honor Code is an integral part of the Princeton experience. Adopted in 1893, it serves as one of the nation’s oldest honor practices for colleges. Every member of every entering class of the University swears allegiance to this code, and there exists a committee that serves as its custodian. The code itself is contentious enough, necessitating not only a duty to not act dishonestly during examinations, but also to report instances where others do this. In fact, not doing so is considered a violation of the code. While this is an interesting debate in and of itself, this column will focus more on the implementation of the code in its present form — whether or not it is “fair.” The Honor Committee consists of 12 undergraduate students, two of whom are in charge of investigating whenever there is an allegation levied against an individual. First, the idea of students judging their peers seems to afford a group of students a lot of power over others. Forget residential college advisers, club presidents and sports team captains — these people can get you kicked out of school. The idea that my peers can possibly pronounce me guilty of something as severe as cheating is hard to swallow. There are two possible justifications for this system. One: this mirrors real life, where ordinary citizens sit on juries. The key difference in the two scenarios is that jury duty is revolving, so the same group of people doesn’t judge for all trials, and that they are selected randomly. In the case of the Honor Committee, it is the same people who preside over such matters for a given term. The second justification for the student-run committee: Students can understand what their peers experience, and hence provide a more emphatic understanding of the act in question. After all, even with juries, the members of society are there to add subjective details into a verdict on a more objective act. This justification, too, is inadequate. The Honor Code, in so many words, excludes extenuating circumstances, no matter how severe their influence, as possible mitigating factors. To quote the Code, “The only adequate defense for a student accused of an academic violation is that the work in question does not, in fact, constitute a violation.” This not only goes off at a tangent to almost every modern justice system, where intent is as, if not more, important than the act committed — which is why murder in the first degree is not the same as murder in the second degree, even though human life is lost at the hands of someone in both cases — but also renders the idea of a student-run committee incredibly redundant. After all, why are students on the committee if they cannot use their experiences to judge their peers in a more subjective manner? Additionally, the randomness with which jury members are selected is crucial because it avoids bias — negative and positive — in the proceedings. The composition of the Honor Committee is interesting in this regard. It includes four class presidents — two current, two previous — and the USG president. All five of these people, by virtue of their roles and positions, are required to be social. They have had campaigns to ask help for and undoubtedly made many friends — and possibly enemies — in their roles as leaders. It is safe to assume they are more outgoing than most of their peers — again, almost required by their roles — which increases the possibility that they may have to pass a verdict on someone they know, or are at least acquainted with. This takes away some impartiality from the proceedings. Lastly, the Honor Committee requires a more transparent structure. Part of the reason the committee and the proceedings are mentioned in such hushed tones is because of the personal and serious nature of the acts and their punishments. But there should be, at the very least, more statistics on hearings and their verdicts, and some semblance of accountability for the members of the committee. How can a group with such far-reaching and serious powers be trusted with no structure in place to keep it in check other than the members’ own consciences and senses of right and wrong? If these were enough, why have the Honor Committee in the first place? The committee exists because students, in tough situations, make mistakes. A hearing is a tough situation, and every member is a student. Why doesn’t the same logic apply to them? The idea of the Honor Code is integral to the academic tradition at a college like ours. But the execution, at least in its current state, makes the whole process, for the sake of irony, dishonorable.|~|Ali Hayat is a sophomore from Lahore, Pakistan.

60317|~|Outside the Bubble: Endorsing Dr. Andrew Zwicker|~|   March 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|Last month, Rep. Rush Holt shocked the 12th congressional district of New Jersey with his announcement that he would not seek reelection. His decisions saddened many in the district, as he has worked for his 15-year tenure as a tireless advocate for reason and rationality in policymaking. In a district which has for years favored the Democratic incumbent by heavy margins, Holt’s announcement threw the congressional race wide open, as four Democrats and one Republican rushed to fill his seat. Because the district votes so heavily Democrat, the upcoming Democratic primary on June 3 will be just as if not more important than the general election between the primary winner and Republican candidate Alieta Eck. Among the Democratic candidates are Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula, Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, State Senator Linda Greenstein and Dr. Andrew Zwicker, a research physicist and science educator from the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Though each of these candidates has a strong record of leadership, Dr. Zwicker stands out as a successor loyal to the leadership this district has seen in Holt. Beyond the obvious similarities in the two researchers’ backgrounds, Dr. Zwicker has shown himself to be a tireless advocate for science and education in particular, and more broadly, a rational and questioning approach to policy. Such a representative is just what Princeton, the 12th congressional district and the nation need. I met Dr. Zwicker a mere week before Rep. Holt’s announcement, when he was the keynote speaker at the launch party for Innovation Magazine, a student-led research review for which I also write. There, he spoke passionately of the urgent need for scientists to communicate their research not only among themselves, but with society. As people grow closer to and more dependent on their technology and as human society faces potential existential crises from climate change to bombardment by extraterrestrial rocks, scientists must increasingly bring their knowledge to bear in the political realm. Unfortunately, the government, in the US particularly but not uniquely, is increasingly filled by those who, as Zwicker phrases it, “replace facts with values.” In his time as a scientist and educator, Dr. Zwicker has done much to counter this trend. He realized the extent to which American highschoolers’ lives could be changed by STEM education while working with a high school summer student when he was fresh out of grad school. “I changed her life and she changed mine,” he says of his former student, now an educator in her own right. Since then, and since moving into the science education of PPPL’s work, he has pushed heavily for STEM education in schools throughout the Trenton/Philadelphia area, training hundreds of students in technological skills and, more importantly, scientific thinking and communication. In the process, he has had a hand in national policy on everything from energy efficiency in buildings to STEM training for teachers. Through it all, he has been dedicated to the local community, focusing his efforts and the millions of dollars in federal funding he has raised on schools from elementary to postsecondary throughout the 12th District. When I spoke to him, Dr. Zwicker was realistic about the odds he faces going into the primary. Assemblywoman Watson Coleman and State Senator Greenstein come into the race with the support of their home counties (Mercer and Middlesex, respectively), and were endorsed by their respective counties’ Democratic Committees mere days after Holt announced his candidacy, and before all the candidates for the district had entered the race. Since then, the race has turned into something of a slugging match between the two women and their supporters, with tensions running high and accusations flying between the two camps. The race has come to be characterized as a “Middlesex versus Mercer/Union” battle between the county parties for influence and advancement of their chosen candidates. Though I agree with the policy positions of Watson Coleman and Greenstein, this represents precisely the sort of status quo that Dr. Zwicker is driven to change. In our conversations, the times he spoke most freely and passionately were regarding his hopes for his time in Washington, saying that how like Newton “stood on the shoulders of giants,” he could build off Rush Holt, “prov[ing] it can be done” to lead Congress in replacing a “value-laden policy with facts.” To overcome the odds against him, Zwicker and his campaign are running an aggressive get out the vote campaign, encouraging local college students (who rarely participate in local electoral politics) to vote in the primary. I urge Princeton students, especially those who have not registered but also those who have considered moving their registration, to register in the 12th district and support Dr. Zwicker. I urge members of the University community to support this outstanding and passionate individual in his quest to uphold the 12th congressional district’s pride in being represented by a scientist. And I urge residents of the 12th congressional district, from Trenton to Franklin Twp., to support this educator who has staunchly supported the communities of the 12th congressional district. Democrats of the 12th congressional district, this June 3, vote for a scientist again.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a sophomore from Littleton, Colo. He can be reached at bam2@princeton.edu. 
60292|~|Editorial: In support of a community against sexual assault |~|   March 30 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|In a Q&A published in The Daily Princetonian on March 11, Susan Patton ’77 argued that women who receive unwanted sexual contact after drinking excessively bear a degree of “responsibility” for their victimization. Patton’s remarks came in defense of claims in her recent book, “Marry Smart”, that a woman who dresses provocatively or who impairs herself by consuming alcohol assumes “accountability for what may happen.” In response to Patton’s comments, 215 University faculty members signed a letter to the editor of the ‘Prince’, published on March 26, stating “we do not believe that their [students’] manner of dress or drinking behavior makes them responsible for unwanted sexual contact” and encouraging students to reach out for help if necessary. The Board endorses these faculty members’ position: the Board not only rejects Patton’s claims on face, but believes that the sentiments they embody are counterproductive to serious, ongoing efforts to combat the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment within the Princeton community. Regardless of the circumstances, the Board believes that sexual assault and sexual harassment represent significant violations of a person for which only perpetrators and accomplices bear responsibility. Though excessive drinking often carries severe consequences in itself, these should not be used to divert accountability for unwanted sexual contact away from those who choose to impose it. Moreover, Patton’s statement that a woman should “simply not allow herself to come to a point where she is no longer capable of protecting her physical self” presents a narrow and inconsiderate view of the issue of sexual assault: such acts are frequently violent in nature and leave victims with little opportunity to resist. Whether or not a victim is able to defend himself or herself against aggression or manipulation is no barometer for accountability. In addition, Patton ignores the fact that sexual assault is often premeditated, motivated by the desire to exercise power and carried out by someone whom the victim knows; in these cases, what an individual happens to be wearing has little or nothing to do with the perpetrator’s decision to deliver unwanted sexual contact. More specifically, comments such as Patton’s threaten the University’s community values and efforts to curb incidents of sexual assault and sexual harassment on Princeton’s campus. According to the Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education office, each year one in nine University undergraduates experiences some form of “power-based personal violence,” a category which encompasses sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and dating or domestic violence. The false impression that victims of unwanted sexual contact somehow deserved it discourages victims from reporting their cases or from seeking the resources available to them, further burdening them with unwarranted feelings of shame and embarrassment. Furthermore, such beliefs undercut the community’s sense of responsibility in standing up for one another. By making recipients of unwanted sexual contact seem more like accomplices than victims in the violations and acts of violence perpetrated against them, we rationalize the actions of perpetrators and find a convenient excuse not to intervene or to defend one another when we are in dangerous situations. Patton’s language contributes to a world in which perpetrators are not held accountable for their actions, incidents of sexual violence become more frequent and the experiences of victims are obscured and met with shame. The Board strongly believes that the University should be a place where victims and survivors feel supported by their community and where individuals can feel safe from sexual assault or sexual harassment. Remarks such as Patton’s are not only mistaken, but belong to an intellectual vacuum that threatens to impede very serious, very real efforts to educate students on ways of thinking about and of dealing with unwanted sexual contact. Dissent  The Board’s position is itself “counterproductive” to fighting the serious problem of sexual assault.  What better way to “make very serious, very real efforts to educate students” about how to combat this grave issue than to provide common sense advice on how to prevent the problem if possible?  While we do not endorse Patton’s every turn of phrase, we recognize the wisdom at the core of her comments: act responsibly and avoid dangerous situations as best you can. We do not condone an uncompassionate, victim-incriminating community. That said, we must also uphold the importance of individual prudence.  It is simply common sense that inebriation and immodest dress render a woman more susceptible to sexual crime at the hands of morally depraved (and perhaps similarly inebriated) men. This does not — in any way — condone such men and the criminality of their behavior.  But the practical ramifications of this sad reality are that women must be especially prudent in avoiding such situations. The Board’s singular focus on the community’s responsibility unhelpfully deemphasizes individual precaution. It is astonishing that the Board should relegate Patton’s practical wisdom, albeit sensationally-worded, to “an intellectual vacuum” when its own advice is itself vacuous.|~|Signed by Zach Horton ’15 and Sergio Leos ’17 
60287|~|The Duke porn star and demonstrated need|~|   March 30 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|When the rumors erupted about a Duke freshman moonlighting as a porn star, the student in question, Belle Knox (her professional name), further fueled the fire when she was interviewed in Duke’s student paper, The Chronicle. After that article and a second article, in which  she explained why she found performing in pornography empowering, debate propagated nationwide on college campuses and beyond. As Knox was interviewed on CNN and elsewhere, people were discussing whether or not her stance on porn and empowerment was completely aligned with feminist goals. And while this is an important conversation to have, it seems foolish to ignore the reason why Knox, a women’s studies and sociology double major who aspires to be a lawyer, decided to join this controversial industry to begin with: college tuition. In every article and interview, Knox explains that she entered the porn industry because she needed money to pay for her Duke education. Though she received some financial aid, it was not enough to make attending Duke a reality. As The Chronicle highlights, “at a private, top-10 university like Duke where the full cost of attendance is steadily creeping to $60,000 a year, [Knox] said she turns to the adult film industry to help supplement her financial aid.” In her column in xoJane.com, Knox explained she turned to porn because her family  “has undergone significant financial burdens,” and she saw a way to graduate from her dream school free of debt, doing something she “absolutely love[s].” Most people take notice of the last clause, that she loves performing in pornography. But it is that first part that worries me. I grew up in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. and attended an International Baccalaureate program that has a great record of getting students into top schools around the country and the world. Despite their success in admissions, 65 of 128 students who reported to our student newspaper where they were attending college the next year said they were going to one of the two campuses of our state university, the University of Maryland. That is over 50 percent of our college-bound class, and it does not include those attending other in-state schools that charge a relatively low in-state tuition. Many of these students turned down schools like Brown, the University of Chicago, NYU, McGill and Vanderbilt purely due to financial restrictions. Universities, including Duke and Princeton, like to brag that they “meet all demonstrated need.” But schools base this on what they believe is required to make attending their school feasible. Many students and families believe they need more than what they are offered in order to make attending certain schools possible and worthwhile. Colleges with high tuitions must do more to make enrollment among low-income and middle-income students reasonably feasible. The University must ensure that its financial policies are entirely, rather than just partially, aligned with the goal of increasing enrollment among lower-income and first-generation students. Given its per-student endowment, there is no excuse for the University not to offer more aid in the “demonstrated need” category and lower the expected family contribution, as well as recruit more low-income students and provide greater assistance for expenses like eating club initiation fees for sophomores. Princeton should be prioritizing financial aid even more if it truly wants to achieve the diversity it claims to strive for and if it wants its yield to reflect the diversity of its acceptances. According to Dean of Admission Janet Rapelye, the University does indeed aim to attract more low-income students. When the Class of 2018 admission statistics were released, Rapelye said: “We are hoping we’ll have more low-income students. We took the research that [economist] Caroline Hoxby did quite seriously. We have admitted more students who participated in the LEDA program and who participated in QuestBridge.” Although the admissions announcement in March does not provide specific statistics regarding the yield of low-income students (unlike the September announcement for the Class of 2017), it would not surprise me if there was a significant difference among lower- and middle-income students accepted versus actually attending Princeton and its peer institutions. As I watch my younger friends struggle with the same tough decisions this month, I urge the University to consult with the students being offered financial aid packages (and even those who aren’t) and reconsider what they establish to be “demonstrated need.” With all the money the University has, potential students shouldn’t feel compelled to attend a different school due to finances. And they certainly shouldn’t have to consider turning to pornography just for the sake of paying tuition.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C.

60191|~|Why the faculty letter matters |~|   March 27 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|Earlier this week, I stumbled upon a Letter to the Editor from the Opinion section of The Daily Princetonian, titled “A faculty statement on sexual assault.” I was confused and a bit intrigued, since I could not think of any recent incident it could be in response to. When I opened the Letter, I found 215 faculty signatures in support of holding victims of sexual assault blameless no matter their level of intoxication or dress, opposed to the statements of Susan Patton ’77 made in her recent interview with ‘The Prince.’ Patton responded to the faculty letter, saying that her recent book suffered because it did not directly contrast rape and “regrettable sex,” as she would have liked. But I digress. This column is not about Susan Patton. This column is about the importance of all parts of campus taking sexual assault, in any and all forms, seriously. There is a support system on campus for victims of sexual assault. We have the Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education center, which has students perform a skit every frosh week called “The Way You Move,” in which a student, after talking to a friend about a supposed hookup, comes to grips with the realization that he has raped someone. SHARE also offers constant support through counselors — both professionally trained and peer — and hosts several events on campus throughout the year to raise awareness of sexual assault on campus and arm students with the tools to dispel situations before they occur. Still, while SHARE provides a substantial amount of support for students who have been assaulted, or for those who want to aid others, many students are oblivious to these efforts. SHARE is not to blame for this. The fundamental issue is reluctance on the part of the student body to acknowledge that sexual assault happens even here, at Princeton. Sexual assault is one of those issues that we have a tendency to critique in other environments rather than their own. This can vary from one university’s students criticizing another institution, to a nation constantly highlighting the dangers of another. A perfect example of this is the media coverage of the constant sexual assaults in India. By the number of stories that I’ve read on Buzzfeed, The New York Times and other sources, the idea of rape becomes a foreign and distant problem. This is not to say that there shouldn’t be extensive coverage on the struggles women face internationally in terms of security. Indeed, there are a number of places where women face much more dire threats concerning their personal safety in comparison to those in America. Were these horrendous acts to go on unnoticed or underreported, the hope of improving the situation becomes much less likely. However, just as American coverage of sexual assault abroad is extensive, it should be equally as widespread in the States themselves — as sexual assault is a much more common occurrence than many realize. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network reported that, according to the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Crime Victimization Survey, on average there are 237,868 sexual assault victims (age 12 or older) of rape and sexual assault each year. It would be foolish to assume that just because we live in an Orange Bubble, we are immune to the atrocities of the outside world. In a ‘Prince’ article covering an unpublished survey conducted by several University offices in 2008, it was said that more than 15 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing non-consensual vaginal penetration during their time at the University. I am fortunate enough to say I have never had any experiences with sexual assault, so I cannot speak as if I know the trauma a victim must feel afterward. But even despite the wonderful resources and nationally, a decreasing rate of sexual assault in the past years according to RAINN, it can always be challenging for a victim of sexual assault to speak about his or her experiences and seek support. However, it is not helpful when we as a society minimize the prevalence of the problem and the ensuing trauma. When Susan Patton and others like her reframe sexual assault as “regrettable sex,” they make it much less likely that victims will speak out and find justice. It is blatantly base to insinuate that a victim is responsible because of an outfit or drinks consumed. I highly commend the faculty who has taken the time to involve themselves in an issue so significant for so many students, and I was proud to have seen former professors who determined circumstances like clothing or alcohol does not make someone assaulted accountable. It is a step in the right direction because a society that perpetuates blame on victims will inevitably perpetuate the crime.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La.

60132|~|The three-day intern|~|   March 27 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Over spring break, I was fortunate enough to be selected to participate in a Princeternship at the University of Southern California, but when the alumna who invited me introduced me to her coworkers, smiles quickly turned to looks of bemusement — “this is Jason, the three-day intern.” Though their reactions were understandable — after all, what sort of comprehensive experience can an “intern” really garner in the span of a few days? — it also reiterated, for me, a rather severe flaw in the conception of vocational experimentation and with the widespread understanding of internships as a whole. The most apt definition of an internship that I could find online was “any official or formal program to provide practical experience for beginners in an occupation or profession.” Other similar explanations of the term conveyed comparable meanings, often with the caveat that internships can be paid or unpaid thrown in. Of note is the fact that such definitions did not at all specify a timeframe or a minimum length of duration that an engagement must last to render it an “official” internship. The problem then is that in our society, popular conceptions of internships are limited to lengthy, intensive programs designed to prepare the intern for future work in a same or similar job. While such a narrow interpretation is highly applicable to upperclassmen — whose internships often serve as vital precursors to occupations after graduation — for many others (predominantly underclassmen), long internships can actually be counterproductive. After all, stories abound of interns who, after spending weeks or months working in a specific industry or field, emerge from their experience only to say that the work simply was not for them. Why did it have to take so much time to figure out something relatively straightforward? That time could have been spent much more productively pursuing other activities or goals. For instance, at USC, even after just three days of shadowing my alumna host and helping with minor tasks, I came to the realization that policy formulation involves a greater amount of data processing than I had initially thought, and I was also surprised by the large amount of interpersonal contact that is necessary among the many disparate departments of the Financial Aid Office. Some might contest that short internships lasting only a few days or a few weeks give participants merely a cursory understanding of what sort of work a certain field requires, but this should indeed be the goal. The purpose is not to emerge an expert in a field — it is to acquaint inexperienced undergraduates with the type of work they would be likely to experience if they pursue longer, more intensive endeavors in the same field. Admittedly, shorter internships run the risk of being too cursory, and spending only a few days might not allow participants the adequate exposure necessary to establish a clear sense of whether a field is “right for them” or not. However, from a cost-benefit perspective, this ambiguity is preferable to spending an entire summer in an internship that initially seemed ideal, but in actuality, proved a poor fit. Overall, a few days is a minor price for the chance to explore different fields, especially when compared to the months-long price tag that comes with lengthier internship engagements. Ideally, though, the general knowledge obtained from the relatively short experience of the Princeternship will serve students well in scoping out future, longer-term internship endeavors that carry more commitment. In this manner, Princeton’s Career Services has done a commendable job implementing the Princeternship program and giving students the capacity to make better, more informed choices, so they don’t end up “wasting their time” chasing an internship in which, as it turns out, they have no real interest. Perhaps it is time that other universities start adopting this model as well, to empower their undergraduate student bodies in a similar manner. It is time to rethink and broaden our perception of internships altogether, to embrace the merits of both lengthier opportunities and shorter ones.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

60139|~|Good truth hunting|~|   March 27 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|We, the millennials, will be remembered as participants in the Age of Information. Most of us hold in our pockets a device that can inform us about almost anything. All right, I thought, so what? Staying attuned to contemporary events requires us not only to have information but also to be able to distinguish the truth in a wide sea of opinions, facts and numbers. This is especially relevant for a world in which the truth does not always seem to be readily available. As I contemplated how people of my age group could insert themselves into an important global discussion of knowledge and our right to have it, I turned to one of my favorite writers. Warren Ellis’ wonderful comic series Transmetropolitan is about a journalist whose desire for the truth embroils him in ugly conflicts with morally skewed politicians. Spider Jerusalem, the aforementioned journalist, seems to be one of the few people in a metropolis of millions who believe that its citizens should have access to the truth, even if they choose to ignore it. The series, first published in 1997, depicted a world in which people downloaded themselves into literal hazes of data called “foglets” (a precursor of Apple’s iCloud?), sprawls of low-income families struggled to survive in forgotten projects and ghettos (Cleveland, Detroit, Camden?) and figures of authority lied — rather, didn’t completely reveal the truth — to the masses (James Clapper?). President Obama, at a news conference in The Hague this week, announced plans that would terminate the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of American telephone data. These proposals would require the NSA to obtain a court order before procuring information from phone companies. Notably, the President said, “We have to win back the trust … of ordinary citizens.” Regarding this point, I certainly don’t disagree. Unfortunately, I believe we live in a time in which national security programs have aided the mass collection of private webcam images. I also believe that many people trusted technological companies, which may have falsely ensured their customers that they knew nothing of bulk email and file collections, to be better than they were. The ire of Spider Jerusalem, a fictional character, is fueled by the vulnerability of real people, real anger and real distrust. As I grappled with this, I wondered whether there was anything college students could do to somehow alleviate a very passionate situation. I once succumbed to a myth that says young people are useful simply for reassuring adults that the world is in good hands. We could make PowerPoint presentations about serious issues, but, of course, we wouldn’t begin to affect real change until our post-graduate lives. This is obviously false. The University happens to be a great example of a school whose students frequently address some of the world’s most pressing issues — moral, political, environmental and so on. While the University is an excellent forum for student creativity and problem-solving, I was still unsure how to account for our place in this tense, post-Snowden world. But I have a few notions of where we might start. Perhaps the most critical step for students (most of whom are neither politicians nor journalists) is the perusal of multiple news sources. I am not just talking about organizations that have a good reputation for the least subjective stories. Gather the biases, and listen to as many voices as you can. We can hope that somewhere in the polyphony resounds a note of truth. I find it very meaningful to read comment sections and personal blogs, too. These are the voices of people not unlike you or I, who share similar concerns and who often contribute facts and opinions about particular articles that the author may not have considered. Reading academic journals, on the other hand — many of which are available through the University’s databases — offers more in-depth analyses than those usually found in news publications. As students in a campus environment, it is true that we may facilitate emotionally cathartic conversations about contemporary events. However, in terms of approaching objective truth, I think our proximity to accomplished faculty members simplifies the process. We attend a school where, only a decade ago, former Princeton professor Robert Hutchings took a leave of absence to chair the National Intelligence Council. Now, if Hutchings still taught here, would I expect him to talk about each detail of his job? Well, no. My point is that we are among people who know a great deal about issues of national importance, and some of these people are players in the game. You’ll forgive me for slightly corrupting the words of Ms. Susan Patton: Before you graduate, find the professors on campus who can speak meaningfully about the topics that matter to you (in this case, the ability to acquire the truth). Of course, once you graduate, you will meet people who know what they’re talking about — but they might not be as well-informed. The University’s technological and human resources allow us to define the Age of Information not based on the number of computers we have, but on our preparedness to find objective truths.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich.

59993|~|Letter to the Editor: March 26, 2014|~|   March 26 2014|~|Letters to the Editor Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|To the Editor: The Daily Princetonian’s recent coverage of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline and its editorial of March 23 were no doubt done with the best of intentions for the Princeton community, but they appear to be based on incomplete information from biased sources. I wish to correct the record on three points. First and foremost, the Editorial Board and others have suggested that the Committee on Discipline does not afford students the presumption of innocence. This is a weighty accusation—one that not only strikes at the heart of the Committee’s process, but also impugns the integrity of the students and faculty members who serve on it, and it is emphatically not true. Students and faculty members are selected by their peers for service on the Committee for their judiciousness, reasonableness and regard for the University’s standards and policies. They undertake rigorous training and engage in exhaustive analysis of each case. Their decisions are firmly grounded in Princeton’s standard of evidence:  that is, no student is found responsible for violating a University policy without clear and persuasive evidence.  To suggest that members of the Committee on Discipline play fast and loose with that standard is to imply that they do not appreciate the gravity of their decisions, and even to hint that they are morally deficient.  The Princeton community should rest assured that nothing could be further from the truth. Second, the Board and others have concluded that the penalties imposed by the Committee for violations of the University’s academic integrity policies are “too harsh given the level of guidance afforded to students.”  Both aspects of this conclusion warrant a response.  The “harshness” of sanctions cannot be evaluated in a vacuum, and it is worth reiterating that Rights, Rules, Responsibilities permits the Committee to regard careless errors and reasonable misunderstandings as lesser offenses and respond with warnings and short terms of disciplinary probations. The Committee reserves suspension for those cases in which students ought reasonably to have understood that their actions violated academic integrity rules—essentially, cases of academic fraud.  These criteria reflect the University’s core values and are consonant with our venerable Honor System. At the same time, the disciplinary system provides students with a robust level of guidance, including the assistance of an adviser of their choosing, ample notice and clearly-written documentation, and virtually unlimited opportunities to engage with the Committee and its representatives. Finally, regarding concerns about transparency, it is important to note that the custodians of Committee records at the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students and the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School are as transparent as possible within the considerable constraints of University confidentiality policies and applicable laws. Those constraints categorically preclude commentary on any particular case or student, among other limitations. Therefore, mischaracterizations of cases must often go unanswered. (It is gratifying to note that even the Board concedes that its criticisms are undercut by the fact that it has no access to the full range of case materials and other evidence considered during a Committee hearing.) At the same time, we regularly publish statistics — always in the aggregate, to protect student confidentiality — and I have readily accepted the suggestion to augment those statistics in the way that the Board describes. Likewise, “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities,” which all Princeton students are expected to read, provides a full description of Committee standards and procedures as well as clear guidance about what constitutes an academic infraction. On behalf of the Committee on Discipline, I welcome informed and conscientious feedback. Kathleen Deignan Chair, Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline Students and faculty members are selected by their peers for service on the Committee for their judiciousness, reasonableness and regard for the University’s standards and policies. They undertake rigorous training and engage in exhaustive analysis of each case. Their decisions are firmly grounded in Princeton’s standard of evidence:  that is, no student is found responsible for violating a University policy without clear and persuasive evidence.  To suggest that members of the Committee on Discipline play fast and loose with that standard is to imply that they do not appreciate the gravity of their decisions, and even to hint that they are morally deficient.  The Princeton community should rest assured that nothing could be further from the truth. Second, the Board and others have concluded that the penalties imposed by the Committee for violations of the University’s academic integrity policies are “too harsh given the level of guidance afforded to students.”  Both aspects of this conclusion warrant a response.  The “harshness” of sanctions cannot be evaluated in a vacuum, and it is worth reiterating that Rights, Rules, Responsibilities permits the Committee to regard careless errors and reasonable misunderstandings as lesser offenses and respond with warnings and short terms of disciplinary probations. The Committee reserves suspension for those cases in which students ought reasonably to have understood that their actions violated academic integrity rules—essentially, cases of academic fraud.  These criteria reflect the University’s core values and are consonant with our venerable Honor System. At the same time, the disciplinary system provides students with a robust level of guidance, including the assistance of an adviser of their choosing, ample notice and clearly-written documentation, and virtually unlimited opportunities to engage with the Committee and its representatives. At the same time, we regularly publish statistics — always in the aggregate, to protect student confidentiality — and I have readily accepted the suggestion to augment those statistics in the way that the Board describes. Likewise, “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities,” which all Princeton students are expected to read, provides a full description of Committee standards and procedures as well as clear guidance about what constitutes an academic infraction. On behalf of the Committee on Discipline, I welcome informed and conscientious feedback.

59929|~|You’re not beautiful, and there’s nothing wrong with that|~|   March 26 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Yotam Sagiv|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|We live in a society obsessed with physical beauty. It doesn’t take much effort to see this: the digital image manipulation that is now so commonplace in product marketing has repeatedly and publicly come under fire for setting unrealistic physical standards for young adults. Opponents of this approach to advertising have attacked it for various reasons, ranging from acidic accusations of amoral manipulations of children to mere unadulterated malevolence. One element, however, that unifies them all is the idea that the perfect way to combat this is to tell everyone in the world that they are beautiful. Indeed, The Dove Campaign for Real Beauty, you-are-beautiful.com’s popular stickers and a whole bunch of anonymous Tiger Ad Mirers submissions staunchly proclaiming the beauty of the reader are united in their belief that remedying the social obsession with physical attraction requires reassuring people that they’re physically attractive. This is wrong. I’m not saying these campaigns are evil. Certainly, the ethical nature of these efforts is nearly impossible to criticize. They are, however, misguided. The true “enemy” — if it can be called that — here is not H&M’s advertising team. It’s not even Adobe Photoshop’s brush tool. The social conception of beauty is rooted in the fact that we have tied people’s sense of worth to their level of physical attractiveness. Unfortunately, the feel-good response adopted by Dove and Tiger Ad Mirers doesn’t actually combat this. In fact, it reinforces it; by telling people that they should be happy because they’re beautiful regardless of what they actually look like, they’re simply supporting the idea that self-worth is grounded in the body. The counsel of Tiger Ad Mirers submission 5336 — “remember you are beautiful” — functions only as a semi-functional short-term solution that in fact exacerbates the issue by reinforcing the source of the disease it is attempting to cure. No, the solution isn’t to anonymously reassure strangers that there is someone out there who will find them attractive. The real approach is to devalue the role of beauty in determining personal value. We should stop saying “no matter what you look like, you are always gorgeous” and start saying “your beauty is not the be all and end all of you as a person.” Elevating the status of attractive intangible aspects will necessarily lead to the diminishment of the role beauty plays in establishing self-worth. Allow people to take pride in the hours they spend playing an instrument every day, in their incredible dance skills, in their ability to recite every movie Morgan Freeman has had a three-line-or-more part in, and the social obsession with beauty will fade. Arguably, we should be reaching for a point where the comment “(s)he looks better than you” carries the same emotional weight as “(s)he dances better than you do” — a point where subjective statements of opinion do not have universal power to create depression and self-doubt. This is admittedly difficult. You can’t control whom you’re attracted to, so manually resetting these preferences will not be easy. It will take time. But it is better to stab at the heart of the beast in this way, by devaluing beauty, than by attacking one of its arms with feel-good campaigns — especially since these misguided retaliations actually help the monster grow. Being beautiful is not a bad thing. We should not demonize those who were born with a certain set of genetic combinations that conforms to some sort of ever-changing social understanding of what it means to be beautiful, nor those who work to achieve a place in that set. On the contrary, beauty is something to be celebrated. However, it is not to be lauded in place of everything else. Physical attractiveness should be appreciated just as much as a great sense of humor or a sparkling personality. By relegating it to a more normal role in our lives, our obsession with beauty will disappear. We will begin to treat people as actual human beings, rather than dehumanizing them by focusing solely on their looks; in equally accounting for the many, many aspects that truly comprise people, we also force ourselves to accept their humanity, a humanity that is more than just beautiful, but also funny, and talented, and poetic, and infinitely multidimensional.|~|Yotam Sagiv is a freshman from Tel Aviv, Israel.

59936|~|Helping out with mental health|~|   March 26 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Kelly Hatfield|~|   Contributor     |~|“Why can’t it just let go?” As her gaze traced the diamond pattern of the carpet, I pieced together the hints that had accumulated over the past months pointing to what she would soon articulate. I began to understand the meaning behind her use of the word “it” and what this amorphous concept had to do with the desperation and hopelessness echoing in her voice. “It” had a very clear clinical name, I realized; “it” was her depression. It’s too easy in conversations like this to not listen fully, to fall prey to the tendency of writing off a friend’s mood as a blip in an otherwise stable condition, something that he’ll “get over.” It’s true that in a high pressure, fast-paced environment such as Princeton, stress manifests itself in a variety of ways, and sometimes declarations of despair stem solely from more temporary conditions. But what happens if, as in my friend’s case, such anguish isn’t a fleeting occurrence? Mental illness isn’t uncommon here. According to the 2012 Committee on Background and Opportunity report conducted by the USG, 49.9 percent of Princeton women and 37.06 percent of men reported feeling depressed “sometimes or often.” And these are just the statistics pertaining to depression. The term “mental illness” covers a large swath of issues, too many for a person not to know someone affected by it personally. Furthermore, mental illness isn’t something that can be dismissed or ignored into oblivion. It is a pervasive condition that is all too often wrongly cast as something that detracts from the strength of the sufferer. Although much has been said on this topic, much still needs to be done, both in and out of the scope of the Orange Bubble. There’s no denying that the University invests quite a few resources in students’ well-being, and no one can question the qualifications and dedication of all the members of the team at McCosh Health Center or of Peer Health Advisers. But it’s not enough. My friend had long suffered from a wide range of mental health issues, but the most pressing when she spoke to me was her depression. Before Intersession, she took the step all of us urged her to take; namely, to seek help from a professional. We simply couldn’t pull her out of what she described as a vortex, and we hoped that a trained psychologist or psychiatrist could. In a time when it was increasingly difficult for her to engage with others and with her many passions, however, she was forced to wait a week and a half for a consultation. Once she received one, she spent an hour running through the major relationships in her life, her history of mental illness, her family’s history. The process, she said, was exhausting and demoralizing. She sought help and, instead, to use her words, had to go through a “laundry list” of her secrets. There are logical reasons behind all of this, of course. There are only so many hours in a day to care for the multitude of students seeking counseling; for the most effective treatment one has to understand context. There are also therapists on call should a student consider seriously harming himself. But my friend’s experience, I think, speaks to larger issues within the University’s interactions with mental illness. One obvious way in which the administration could help the situation would simply be to employ a greater number of professionals to expedite the process of getting that initial help, particularly for those like my friend, who occupy the gray area between complete panic or despair and a lesser, but no less real, degree of urgency. I acknowledge that wait times vary between individuals, but if even one student has to wait a length of time that could potentially be detrimental to his mental health, the system is not working as it should. As this solution of hiring more therapists is perhaps impractical, Counseling and Psychological Services could at least expedite the process for seeking help. There’s no way to replace the necessary iteration of one’s past, but part of what makes that part so unbearable is the fact that it comes after said waiting period. Why can students not complete a form with such questions prior to the first session? Simple measures could go a long way. Though the University must work to improve the system, I urge students to not leave all the reform up to Princeton. Perhaps members of various student groups on campus could work to spread awareness of hotlines specifically geared toward individuals such as my friend, for sometimes sufferers don’t want to “burden” those close to them and need that anonymous, objective third party to offer insight or compassion. The institution of PHAs likely stemmed from such a need, but they deal with such a wide range of issues for such a large volume of students, that a new group dedicated solely to mental health is in order. In any case, however, I implore you all to listen, to read beyond ambiguous “it”s and to help a friend overcome or cope with mental illness.|~|Kelly Hatfield is a freshman from Medford, Mass.

It is extremely important that individuals of all genders on a college campus feel comfortable reaching out for help. We, the undersigned faculty, stand behind victims of sexual assault and want them to know that our campus is a place where they have a voice, where they will not be made to feel responsible and where they can find support and justice. If you have been the victim of unwanted sexual contact, under any circumstances, we can help you find the support you need from the campus groups listed below. As academics and members of the Princeton University community, these are the values we embrace. We encourage others to stand with us, for the integrity, health and well-being of all our students.

Editor’s Note: The specific statement that motivated this letter is included in an abridged version below. The full Q&A was published on March 11. Daily Princetonian: You wrote: “Please spare me your ‘blaming the victim’ outrage,” saying that a provocatively dressed drunk woman “must bear accountability for what may happen.” Why does the woman hold the responsibility in the case of rape or sexual assault? Susan Patton ’77: The reason is, she is the one most likely to be harmed, so she is the one that needs to take control of the situation. She is that one that needs to take responsibility for herself and for her own safety, and simply not allow herself to come to a point where she is no longer capable of protecting her physical self. The analogy that I would give you is: If you cross the street without looking both ways and a car jumps the light or isn’t paying attention, and you get hit by a car — as a woman or as anybody — and you say, ‘Well I had a green light,’ well yes you did have a green light but that wasn’t enough. So in the same way, a woman who is going to say, ‘Well the man should have recognized that I was drunk and not pushed me beyond the level at which I was happy to engage with him,’ well, you didn’t look both ways. I mean yes, you’re right, a man should act better, men should be more respectful of women, but in the absence of that, and regardless of whether they are or are not, women must take care of themselves.|~|

59726|~|SAT facelift|~|   March 25 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|The College Board recently announced that the SAT is getting yet another facelift, the most drastic set of changes since the March 2005 exam debuted with an entirely new writing section. The rise of the ACT has done good things for the college admission process. Whether the ACT is better than the SAT or if it is any more reflective of a student’s raw intelligence is beside the point. What’s important is that it has shattered the College Board’s monopoly of the college admission exam market and is spurring the company to enact changes. Starting in 2016, the test will make the writing section optional, go back to the 1600 scale, no longer deduct points for incorrect answers, focus less on “obscure” vocabulary words and most importantly, begin to offer free test prep materials in conjunction with Khan Academy. The overhaul is primarily intended to level the playing field across the socioeconomic gradient. Several of the changes are very important steps in the right direction. Hundred-point jumps in SAT scores are quite feasible with adequate and well-targeted test prep. Private tutors and 12-week summer prep courses aim to do just this, but their sizeable price tags mean that the wealthy can have a considerable leg up. Offering free test prep — especially test prep from a reputable company such as Khan Academy — is a very important and commendable step to reducing the disparity. The thing is, the root of College Board’s problem remains untouched. More than anything, the SAT measures an individual’s ability to take the SAT. Cramming and crash-courses wouldn’t make a significant difference on an IQ test; but for the SAT, they could result in a difference of 100 points. While these new measures will help more students perform better on the exam, colleges are still using a very tenuous measure of college potential to sort their applicants. Over time, these changes should hopefully accumulate to make an altogether better test. It’s laudable that the College Board is trying to level the playing field; however, if the end goal is to design a test that will accurately reflect a student’s future performance in a college setting, dropping the essay is a step in the wrong direction. The essay — which has to be completed in 25 minutes — is arguably the most universally applicable portion of the entire exam. At the very least, more applicable than answering 12 multiple choice questions on the mating patterns of New England lobster populations during the rainy season in the critical reading section. The essay makes students hone their ability to argue. The essay prompts have never been terribly lofty — something strongly evidenced by the fact that the SAT that I took asked me to write about reality television. Writing something cohesive that quickly will undoubtedly seem daunting to the average 16-year-old. But it’s a skill easily mastered and arguably the skill I found most useful from the SATs. So too is the ability to make up a cohesive thesis under a time crunch and find legitimate examples to back it up. Having to formulate and support arguments quickly is a common theme in precept, for example. It’s also not a skill that requires much formal education. You don’t need to study obscure words or memorize arcane formulas to argue a point concisely, and thus for the old SAT, it’s the one section that carries little predisposition for the higher socioeconomic demographic. As much emphasis as colleges put on building a well-rounded class by using a holistic admission process, it’s undeniable that the SATs are important in every case. The College Board is making important strides in leveling the playing field across socioeconomic disparity, but it is making a huge mistake by making the essay portion of the exam optional. Hopefully, the exam will keep evolving, and the ideal formula will come along sooner rather than later.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

59719|~|Editorial: Address sophomore dues |~|   March 25 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Every spring, numerous articles about Bicker are written both in this paper and other sources. We discuss whether the system is fair, whether it is outdated and what happens to the people who do not get into or join a club. However, one thing often neglected in the coverage is what happens to those sophomores who join and find themselves responsible for dues that they will struggle to or cannot pay. The Board thinks this is an aspect of the eating club system that is underaddressed. In recent years, the Interclub Council has improved transparency with regard to dues. Official club dues, including sophomore dues, are published online with the hope that this will allow students to better plan for how they will pay. However, despite these efforts, the Board thinks that for some sophomores, factors such as the fast pace of spring semester, an appropriate focus on academics and extracurriculars or the uncertainty of Bicker can make it difficult for lower-income students to get together the payment in advance. Given this, the Board would like to offer a series of recommendations to the University and the eating clubs themselves that can help to make the eating club system more accessible, both for sophomores who join and struggle to pay and for those sophomores who cannot join at all because of the financial burden. First, we think that the University could look at expanding financial aid available for sophomores who join eating clubs. Upperclassmen receive an increase in aid that is based on the difference in the cost of joining a club and staying on the University meal plan. This increase is designed to make joining a club an option for those on financial aid. The sophomore year dues that usually cover social fees, a club fee and a deposit for the fall can cost up to and even more than $1,000 depending on the club — but there is no financial aid available to help cover this burdensome sum. Given that the meals that sophomores receive are exchanges with their own dining hall meal plans, these sophomore club dues do not heavily go toward food. The University currently does not subsidize social fees of the upperclassman club members, and there is rightfully a debate to be had on the matter. However, we would like to advocate that the University and individual clubs look into creating funds, perhaps maintained by alumni donations, to help make the sophomore year eating club experience accessible to all students regardless of background. The Board suspects that there would be many alumni who would be willing to help current students have access to a system that is a large part of Princeton life for many Princetonians. Ivy Club already has such a scholarship system. We also think that the clubs could look at ways to offset these costs. We realize that given the clubs’ nonprofit statuses, there may be legal issues with clubs establishing formal scholarships, but we think that the ICC should continue to work with the University to look for ways to make a scholarship fund a reality. Additionally, we suggest that the clubs look to distribute some of the sophomore dues to junior and senior years. The Board feels that even though this would make it harder for students to pay in later years, the increase in financial aid and the ability to use spring semester and summer to plan for the cost of dues would make it easier for students to afford club membership. While there are debates to be had over the eating club system, the fact is that it is a large part of the University experience for many of our students. As long as the system exists as is, we have the responsibility to strive to make it financially accessible to all Princeton students. A student’s family income should not impact his ability to join a club, and we hope that the University and the ICC continue to look for ways to remove the barriers that prevent students from being a part of the eating club system, financial or otherwise.|~|

59555|~|The value of not knowing|~|   March 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|While at Princeton, students are expected to talk about their experiences struggling to get here, their stories of trying to stay here — and stay sane, for that matter — and most of all, what helped them make it into this institution. Sometimes it seems like there is never a moment when we’re not trying to establish our merit whether to our peers or even to ourselves. Whether confronted with professors, preceptors, classmates or friends, we have to mark out what makes us special and remarkable, because in this case, “being special” sometimes seems to be as close as we can get to “belonging.” But what happens when your appearance and your stereotype dictate a false image or a misrepresentation of what really makes you special? I have a face that doesn’t “belong” to any one place. I have characteristic features of an Indian with some Hispanic undertones, but I find that my languages, my experiences and the things that I love about my Chinese heritage often overpower these features. So what do you do when your face betrays you? What do you do when you find yourself in a room full of South Asians with no knowledge about where Goa is on a map despite it being the childhood home of your father or when you make the mortifying blunder of exchanging “Hindi” for “Hindu” in a conversation or when you have absolutely no idea how to drape a sari? Recently, Harvard students released the debut of the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign, a project that explores the experiences of the black student community at Harvard using photographs of individuals holding whiteboards that showcase powerful statements about racial and cultural stereotypes. The photograph that resonated the most with me was that of a student holding whiteboard that said, “The lack of diversity in this classroom does NOT make me the voice of all black people.” In academic institutions, expertise is prized; first-hand biographical experience makes your stories interesting and reliable. People turn to you when they want to know when your country’s civil war was fought, how you’re supposed to participate in a tea ceremony or how much it snows in the winter where your grandparents had once lived — even if you’ve told them you’ve never visited that place. However, I’ve realized there is strength in not knowing, and even more strength in being able to say, “I am not the poster boy or spokesperson you turn to when you don’t know something.” After all, what is so shameful about lacking knowledge about a certain culture, custom or historical fact if you are willing and enthusiastic to learn? Would feigning knowledge be any less embarrassing? I have found that my experience is, more often than not, different from the experiences of the people whose culture others think I’m a part of. I therefore feel as though I cannot speak on their behalf and shouldn’t be expected to do so. If I connect with you, it is not because I’m black, white, Latin American, East Asian or anything else. When I tell you something about my Chinese culture, I am telling you what I know, regardless of what you think my responsibility is to my other backgrounds. And in this way, I represent myself and show what really makes me special. I ask others to not be ignorant about my ignorance, because in doing so, you prevent both of us from learning the truth.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.

59560|~|Grade deflation devalues education |~|   March 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|On both sides of the grade deflation debate, the most talked-about argument is its effects on postgraduation employment or admission to graduate schools. On one side, the administration allows students applying to jobs or graduate schools to attach a letter from the University explaining its tough grading stance compared to other universities. However, many students remain worried about the effects grade deflation may have on postgraduation plans. But whether or not these doubts about grade deflation barring seniors from jobs are true, I argue that we are overlooking an even more important issue grade deflation raises: the issue of whether or not it impacts the quality of our education itself. ​The fact is, regardless of whether Princeton grades really look bad in comparison to grades from another school to employers, students think they will. Furthermore, they know high grades are still achievable — they know A’s are still floating out there, but think there are less of them in the grab bag. According to the administration, this isn’t strictly true in every case, as it points out the 35 percent cap is not a hard cutoff. And, of course, adherence to the 35 percent benchmark varies from professor to professor. But the dangerous thing is that students are wary of whether or not this is true, and that perception is impacting their decisions regarding course selection and the learning process itself. Students are refusing to accept that lower grades are the norm because of grade deflation, especially ones who depend on high GPAs for admission to a medical school or another competitive program, and are doing anything they can to garner the grades they want, whether that means not taking classes out of pure interest or taking requirements at another institution for higher grades. ​In some instances, taking classes over the summer is valid — for example, in the case of course deficiency or in the case of not having other engagements over the summer. However, several fellow students I know have taken Princeton requirements at other institutions over the summer, on top of full-time internships, just to escape grade deflation. In these cases, students are bypassing full-term classes that are prerequisites to other classes and teach fundamental skills they’ll need later on — for example, linear algebra or physics — by doing accelerated programs that aren’t as rigorous as the University’s courses. This is an unintended consequence of a grading policy intended to “provide fair and consistent standards across the University.” Implicitly, these standards are intended to encourage students to work harder for better grades and thus learn more rigorously, but students will not learn more if the standards are causing them to bypass Princeton requirements by taking equivalent courses elsewhere. ​It also seems around campus that grade deflation is creating a desperate culture of course-engineering in order to maintain higher GPAs. I have spoken with people who have shied away from language classes they otherwise would have taken simply because of a harsh curve. I myself would have liked to take COS 340: Reasoning About Computation, if not for the fact that it is notoriously an easy A for math majors and a crapshoot for everyone else. It is of course natural for students to take a reasonable course load and not burden themselves with several hard classes at once, but it is also not acceptable for Princeton students to bar themselves from learning what they want to because of stress over a grading policy. I see classmates dropping out of classes they want to be in after a horrendous curve on the midterm — ECO 362: Financial Investments had a median of 100 percent last year — and classmates taking the same PDF-only courses — namely creative writing — again and again and again instead of something new. This pattern of action shows me that regardless of whether or not graduate schools and employers accept grade deflation, students cannot accept that they are getting lower grades than their peers at other institutions and are basing educational decisions on finding ways to mitigate the negative impact of grade deflation. ​It is a reasonable goal to provide “fair and consistent” grading standards, but the University must understand that it is hard to accept these standards for students who still, regardless of what letters the administration sends and regardless of what the administration says, feel they are up against other schools who are grading on a different scale. Either the students must be once and for all persuaded that grade deflation doesn’t negatively impact them, or some more leniency must be granted in the grading policy, because the culture that exists now is a fear – a fear of learning what they want to know and what they need to know.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

59558|~|Why Princeton students don’t try new things |~|   March 24 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Zeena Mubarak|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|There are no introductory courses in Princeton. Of course, there are classes that are given a 100-level designation. But when you enter the class, you realize that everyone there not only has experience in the subject, but they’ve been (painting, speaking the language, dancing, fill-in-the-blank-ing) since they were two years old. What the registrar’s page says: No prerequisites. What it means: You better have done it in high school, all four years, and excelled in it. I once walked into the studio for VIS 204: Introductory Painting, and everything in there was practically fit to be hung in our lovely art museum. The students were all using advanced techniques; they could shape and contour perfectly with their oil paints. All of these masterpieces were clearly not the work of people who had picked up their first brush at the beginning of the semester. This phenomenon is hardly restricted to art. I have talked to multiple people taking SPA 101: Beginner’s Spanish I, and I have been assured that all of the people in their sections had previous experience with Spanish in high school. The culprit? Perhaps it is everyone’s favorite bogeyman: grade deflation. With the University’s harsh grading policies, trying something new could have a disastrous impact on your GPA. What if you’re not good at it, whatever it might be? Princeton students are smart, of course, so we end up hedging our bets — it’s better to do something that we know we’ll be good at because then we can get that coveted A (let’s be real, more like a B-plus). There is no point taking, for example, basket weaving, because you might be bad at basket weaving — unless you were captain of your high school’s award-winning basket weaving team. That could be how an introductory art class ends up filled with Michelangelos (although Michelangelo probably would have received an A-minus in Introductory Painting). Maybe we shouldn’t blame grade deflation, though — at least not this time — since you could always elect to take a course pass/D/fail if you really wanted to take it but you weren’t sure you could do well. Maybe the problem is deeper, a little more psychological. People who make it all the way to Princeton are used to winning (your basket weaving team made it all the way to Nationals under your expert leadership). After all, it is all those wins on our résumé which helped us make it here. So it could be that after an entire high school experience made of wins, Princeton students are not ready to risk defeat. If you try something new, you might, horror of horrors, actually fail to excel. To avoid the ignominy of not being amazing at something, we stick with what we know. Introductory art classes are populated with Michelangelos because maybe Michelangelo won’t be able to weave an attractive basket. Whatever the reason for it, the lack of opportunities to try new things in Princeton is a serious problem. College is supposed to be a time for branching out and exploring different things. At Princeton, none of that is possible. You do what you have always been good at, and that is terribly sad. I want the chance to really learn. There are so many cool classes here and I want to take as many as possible. Unfortunately, a lot of them are just unofficially off-limits. If I enrolled in an introductory art course, I would walk in and be painting stick figures as my classmates produced Mona Lisas. Whichever way you slice it, that is not a fun position to be in. We need to ensure the integrity of our sacred introductory courses. We deserve the right to take random classes with impunity (as long as they fulfill distribution requirements, of course; we are still pragmatic Princeton students). We deserve the right to see “Introductory” on the registrar’s page and know that it is not a lie. It is a bold vision, but I think we are worth it. Luckily, it is within our power to make it come true. Every Princeton student needs to take the brave step of signing up for classes which they are merely qualified for. It will be difficult to cede control, to risk not always knowing what is going on in a class, but it will be worth it because your reward will be getting to finally learn something new. So say “no” to taking classes you might be qualified to teach. Say “yes” to maybe getting a less-than-perfect grade. It is a cliché because it has some truth to it: College is a time for experimentation.|~|Zeena Mubarak is a freshman from Fairfax, Va. She can be reached at zmubarak@princeton.edu.

59411|~|On transfer student policies |~|   March 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|A few weeks ago, The Daily Princetonian reported that the University administration was considering overturning its current policy banning transfer students. Factors such as increased access for low-income students, community college students and military veterans were described as the motives for the possible shift. Even though shifting the policy such that transfer students could enter after freshman fall would most likely accomplish these goals, I believe that certain aspects of the University experience would make this plan as it stands infeasible, and enacting it without changing other policies would not be in the best interest of the students who would transfer here. A major hurdle transfer students to Princeton would have to overcome involves preparation for junior and senior year classes. While I’m not arguing this is true at every school, there would clearly be many cases in which the student’s old school simply did not go into as much depth as the equivalent course here. Given that the departments all have prerequisites for potential majors, it is clear that a certain level of familiarity with the subject is critical before pursuing higher-level classes and work in that topic. For transfer students who’d like to major in subjects they are less well-prepared for, the possibility of being significantly disadvantaged in upper-level classes is quite large. Having a solid foundation in introductory or mid-level courses in a topic obviously makes one better prepared to undertake higher-level work in that field. Simply assuming that all schools teach introductory level classes to the same degree that Princeton and its peers do leaves many would-be transfer students with a disadvantage to overcome before they even enter. When the time comes for transfer students to take upper-level classes in their major, they would be less well-prepared than their peers, and would suffer as a result. Stemming from this lack of adequate preparation for upper-level classes is a similar disadvantage in independent work. By not having the training for future college-level papers offered through the Writing Seminar and Freshman Seminar programs, transfer students would be disadvantaged in upper-level classes upon declaring a major. These disadvantages compounded would leave transfer students comparatively ill-suited to begin writing junior papers and senior theses. By first missing out on the basic preparation for college-level academic writing that the Writing Seminar program offers, and then producing lower-quality in-class work sophomore and junior year as a result (if the seminars are, in fact, doing what they are supposed to be doing), transfer students would on average be less prepared to produce high-quality independent work. Having taken freshman and sophomore classes that are probably less in-depth and lacking the foundation in academic writing necessary, transfer students would be unfairly disadvantaged come time to write their theses. Therefore, if the University were to allow transfer students, I believe certain policy changes commensurate to the difference in their experience would be necessary. Requiring transfer students to take a writing seminar, though allowing them to pass out of it if they’ve taken an equivalent course of similar quality, would help close the gap in preparation for academic writing, and afford transfer students an additional chance to be on a level playing field with their peers come junior or senior year. Additionally, Princeton should offer research seminars to all sophomores, and mandate that all transfer students take one. While the final paper of the writing seminar does focus more on independent research, and some departments offer a type of research seminar during junior year (for example, Wilson School Task Forces), such a program would better prepare all students — but especially transfers — for the independent research involved in JPs and theses. By the time JP and thesis work comes around, transfer students would have made up at least a large portion of the potential disparity in preparation, and would be much more on par with their classmates who entered as freshman in terms of writing ability and performance in high-level classes. By formally correcting for the disparity of preparation for upper-level classes and independent work, Princeton could encourage more students to apply to transfer. Without such policies, simply the knowledge that such a disparity exists would discourage some students from transferring to Princeton. The knowledge that they would face a steeper uphill battle come junior and senior year would be enough to make some would-be Tigers transfer to other schools that don’t have such independent work. If Princeton were to afford students extra opportunities, however, some students would find this a more manageable challenge, and would be more inclined to come. If Princeton were to accept transfer applications it would have to be done in such a way as to best serve those students who would transfer here. By requiring writing seminars and research seminars for transfer students, Princeton could work to provide them with as close to an equivalent experience as possible to that which four-year students have.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

59407|~|Editorial: Review the Committee on Discipline |~|   March 23 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The Daily Princetonian recently published a series of three articles documenting various aspects of the operation of the University’s Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. These articles explored everything from the number of incidents reported to the Committee to the process the Committee employs when reviewing a case. Concerns were raised about the Committee’s lack of transparency, the conduct of its hearings and the severity of its disciplinary measures. In light of these criticisms, the Board recommends that the University administration review the Committee’s policies as well as the implementation of these policies so as to address many of these complaints. The punitive practices of the Committee outlined in “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities” have recently been questioned and should be reviewed in order to ensure that the Committee best serves its purpose. Dean of Undergraduate Students and current Committee Chair Kathleen Deignan was recently quoted in one of the articles affirming the University’s approach to discipline as educational. However, punishments levied against students have been criticized as overly harsh, to the point where the learning process the Committee purports to uphold is destroyed. The Board agrees that punishments are too harsh given the level of guidance afforded to students. While the process is not meant to be adversarial and does provide students an adviser, the Board agrees with local attorney, student adviser and former ‘Prince’ columnist William Potter ’68 when he — in the same article — argued that the current levels of punishment merit greater levels of guidance. Thus, the Board believes that a review of this practice is necessary to determine how to maintain the educational aspect of the disciplinary procedure. Another procedural criticism rests with the way the Committee practices its own policies during hearings. Potter and Wilson School professor and student adviser Stanley Katz both argued in the ‘Prince’ article that the Committee becomes invested in its own arguments and evidence to the point where the presumption of innocence in hearings is lost.  The presumption of innocence is important both to ensure that innocent students are not convicted and to maintain student confidence in the Committee. Further, a presumption of guilt eliminates the protection afforded to students under the Committee’s high standard of “clear and persuasive” evidence. While the Board does not have access to the hearings themselves, the gravity of this criticism is sufficient to merit administrative review. Finally, the Committee has been criticized for not implementing policies to promote transparency. The Board understands that students bear some of the responsibility to understand the policies of the Committee.  Freshmen are given presentations on the Committee as well as copies of “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities.”  However, the Board believes that the Committee’s status as a University body that directly interacts with students necessitates a higher level of transparency than is currently in place, and further argues that the opacity of the institution’s process has resulted in a lack of confidence.  For example, the Committee does not release statistics of the number of cases heard or the number of convictions.  While another of the three ‘Prince’ articles cites the Committee’s belief that the release of such numbers would harm the Committee’s reputation, the Board instead argues that increased transparency would improve the Committee’s standing in the eyes of the student body. Further, in an email to the Board, Dean Deignan expressed her willingness to release these numbers in future annual reports. Understanding that exact statistics may violate the privacy of students, the Board urges the Committee to release average statistics and encourages an administrative review to determine further ways to improve transparency. The Board believes that the number and the seriousness of these criticisms necessitate another look at these policies. There is no record of a recent review of the Committee on Discipline. In an email to the Board, Dean Deignan only highlighted recent changes made to the Committee’s membership as well as its handling of behavioral cases, and further clarified that faculty action is required to change Committee policies. The Board further believes that these criticisms have resulted in a lack of confidence in the Committee, something the University administration should work with students to fix. Policies and practices have come under fire, and a review, along with the appropriate changes, is the best way to restore confidence in the Committee and ensure that it carries out its purpose effectively and fairly.|~|Mitchell Johnston is recused due to his position on the Princeton Honor Committee.  
59388|~|Outside the Bubble: An automated world |~|   March 23 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|“A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.” In science fiction writer Isaac Asimov’s “I, Robot” (later turned into a less-than-compelling movie of the same name starring Will Smith) there are four laws that robots must follow, one of which is stated above. While such a world, where upgraded human-like robots exist, is currently only plausible in the realm of our imaginations and science fiction, the threat that automation poses to society — with specific regard to employment — may already appear today. Last week, Bill Gates gave a speech at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. on the future impact of technology on the economy. In the midst of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the Russian takeover of Crimea and midterms, it was easy to miss. Yet, despite its lack of coverage, Gates’ message may be the one of the most important news stories of the week. In the speech, Gates’ expressed his fear of “software substitution,” saying that “technology over time will reduce demand for jobs, particularly at the lower end of skill set … 20 years from now, labor demand for lots of skill sets will be substantially lower. I don’t think people have that in their mental model.” Granted, this is not the first time that technology has threatened employment before. Fears of technology-based unemployment have been recurring with the industrialization of the past two centuries. One only has to look at the Luddites of 19th century England, where unemployed textile workers destroyed lacemaking machines that were cheaper than human labor. The classic belief is that while automation may result in a decrease in jobs, it will also increase wages, which will in turn create a greater demand for more products and services, thus creating new jobs for the recently displaced. But as technology has increased, the baseline for the skill sets required has also increased. In the past, technology has only been able to outpace us physically, being able to produce more or read more data within a set limit of time. However, with the turn towards increasing technological intelligence, technology now threatens our intellectual monopoly as well. Who needs human taxi drivers when automated Google cars can not only drive efficiently, but also can calculate the quickest route based on constantly updated traffic data on weather and delays? The days of robot lawyers or scientists are very far from us, but replacement in fields such as telemarketing, accounting, and retail work may be only 15 to 20 years away. What could result is an inequality in impact, where those with college degrees in higher-skilled jobs will remain unaffected, while those at the bottom, who lack the needed skill sets, will find themselves unemployed. Unfortunately when profits increase, they will not always trickle down to those who serve as the means of production. Increased profits are often only reinvested by those at the top. As technology outpaces the need for human labor, those at the bottom will then suffer the most. Gates’ solution is to reform the tax code in order to incentivize businesses to choose humans over automated labor, possibly by removing the income and payroll taxes altogether.  He also discourages the recent call for raises in the minimum wage, because it could “potentially dampen demand” for lower skilled jobs. However, this would only seem to aggravate the problem rather than take steps toward a solution. Even now, it is much more efficient to have a machine paint a new car than to have an unpaid person paint each car on an assembly line. Work in certain industries will reach a point where the increased efficiency far offsets the smaller initial costs of buying the machinery in the first place. While I highly doubt we need to fear anything like “I, Robot”, where we live in a dystopian future threatened by robot intelligence, the fact that Bill Gates has commented on the threat of automation to our economy signifies its potential impact. Realistically, a world where all jobs are automated will not happen in our lifetime. But there does exist a potential for a greater economic divide between the rich and poor, which can only weaken — rather than strengthen — a country. Although many Princeton students, who will end up in higher-skilled jobs, may not have to worry about losing out to a machine any time soon, these may be the decisions that future Princetonians will have to decide. Technological advancements should be celebrated, and definitely should not be destroyed or rallied against. Still, it is important to acknowledge that with these new changes also come with unintended costs that will have large implications on society. Rather than blindly ignoring that potential, we should do our best to address it now, while it is still an idea, and not a reality.|~|
59224|~|Keystone blight |~|   March 13 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Mason Herson-Hord ’15, Dayton Martindale ’15, Rachel Parks ’15, Alvaro Sottil ’16, Katie Horvath ’15, Damaris Miller ’15, Nikolaus Hofer ’17, Divya Farias ’15, Parth Parihar ’15 and Lucie Wright ’14. On March 10, guest contributor Duncan Hosie ’16 wrote “The Case for Keystone,” a well-articulated yet misleading op-ed in support of completing Keystone XL, a stalled pipeline project intended to transport Alberta’s tar sands oil to the Gulf of Mexico. Allow us, some of those very students he described as “harming our national security interests, economic growth and even environmental well-being,” to respond to these claims. We see issues with his argument’s specifics, but, details aside, we believe that climate change discourse at Princeton and elsewhere needs to be reframed. We need an approach that avoids defeatist assumptions in favor of one committed to climate justice and focused on the urgent realities facing our generation. Hosie focuses on national security, asserting that purchasing more of our oil from Canada would allow us to avoid dealing with less stable regimes. But oil companies would use the pipeline to largely bypass U.S. consumers and ship tar sands oil from refineries on the Gulf Coast to world markets, so the pipeline would not reduce American dependence on overseas oil. Meanwhile, the Pentagon, like environmental activists, recognizes the realities of climate change and is developing long-term strategies to deal with the violence and unrest that will accompany the resulting natural disasters, famines, political disorder and economic collapse. Keystone purportedly attempts to solve a short-term national security dilemma by exacerbating a much more far-reaching one. Many people, including Hosie, cite a figure claiming that the construction of the pipeline would create 42,100 jobs. However, although Keystone would create thousands of short-term construction jobs, according to that same State Department report, the project would create only 35 permanent jobs lasting beyond the two-year construction period. The $3.4 billion in potential revenue also pales in comparison to the $65 billion in damage caused by Hurricane Sandy alone, a storm whose intensity has been directly linked to the warming of our oceans. Between the costs of droughts, soil loss, floods, powerful storms, heat waves and more, there is no question that it is cheaper to avert climate change now than to deal with its consequences later. It is Hosie’s argument about environmental impacts, focused on transport and the perceived false dichotomy between economics and environmentalism, though, that really misses the point. The basic facts are these: We are rapidly approaching the absolute warming limit of two degrees Celsius already agreed upon by the international community, and to avert disaster, we can pour no more than 565 additional gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere. There are 240 gigatons of carbon stored in Alberta’s tar sands alone, not including the carbon stored in the boreal forests that are clear-cut to reach them. We simply cannot afford to burn tar sands oil, period, which emits 17 percent more greenhouse gas in its extraction and use than regular oil and would dash any hopes for an ecologically or economically stable future. Stopping the pipeline will not in itself be enough to prevent catastrophic climate change. But it is a crucial step in the right direction. These oil companies have admitted bluntly that the pipeline will allow them to extract more intensively, and cutting them off wherever possible will weaken economic incentive and political will to continue tar sands development. Nor are we alone. To assume that the decisions of other governments such as Canada and China are static is to ignore their own internal political struggles over greenhouse gas emissions and ecological devastation. Our allies to the north in the climate justice movement — such as the indigenous grassroots resistance movement Idle No More — are putting their own bodies on the line to defend their communities and the rest of humanity from the consequences of extracting and burning tar sands oil. Just last week, the Chinese government itself “declared war on pollution.” Proponents of Keystone XL are operating under the presumption that American and international dependence on oil is not subject to change. But there is nothing “inevitable” about other countries blundering down the path of runaway carbon emissions, and American myopia should not be inevitable either. The false choice of “they burn it or we burn it” amounts to the difference between jumping off a 100-story building and a 90-story one. The assertion that “the United States will inevitably need to procure crude oil for a long time” assumes as its baseline that we will not make the transition before it is too late and so refuses to consider any alternatives. We reject such defeatism. The discussion should not be about better or worse ways to burn tar sands oil or whether it should be refined in Texas or China. For our generation, and for anyone who believes that the stability of the planet’s climate is more important than returns for fossil fuel companies, the only relevant goal is keeping it in the ground. Our generation’s survival strategy needs to be centered around stalling and ultimately stopping tar sands extraction as soon as possible. The time to act was yesterday, and we can bury our heads in the tar sands no longer. Another world is possible. We must say “no” to Keystone XL.|~|Herson-Hord, Martindale, Parks, Sottil, Horvath, Miller, Hofer, Farias, Parihar and Wright can be reached at mherson@princeton.edu.  
59207|~|Debriefing the meningitis outbreak |~|   March 13 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Michael Kochis  As chair of the Student Health Advisory Board, and more importantly, one who truly cares about the well-being of everyone on campus, I think it’s crucially important that we don’t just move on from the meningitis outbreak and forget about what occurred these past few months. What happened? Since last spring, eight students contracted a rare form of bacterial meningitis. The University initially encouraged us to maintain proper hygiene and not share cups, but the disease continued to spread. National media picked up on these events and drew considerable attention to our school. In an unprecedented manner, a controversial vaccine was specially brought to the University and administered to the student body. Currently 97 percent of undergrads (5,035) have received a first dose of the vaccine, and 4,384 (84 percent of all undergrads; 87 percent of those who received the first dose) have received both the first and second dose. The same University Health Services staff members who provided me those statistics expect that the second number will rise on March 26 and 27, when people who got their first shot in February will be eligible for their second dose, and in-season athletes who wanted to wait to receive the second dose will be ready to complete the full cycle. So what? Personally, I am immensely proud of those numbers, and professionals around the country have been amazed by the success in making this intervention work. On behalf of SHAB, I want to thank the professionals from Environmental Health and Safety, UHS, the NJ Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who worked to make the vaccination possible and the entire student body for their cooperation throughout the process. I want to commend students’ resilience in bearing the pain of the first shot and then the commitment and courage to go through it again. Now what can we gain from this? Sure, we have cool buttons, a couple plastic cups sitting on our shelves and the phrase “meng arm” as part of our collective vocabulary. But above all, there are lessons that can we take forward. First, unexpected things happen. We do not know whether the reported cases were related to one common source, and it’s unlikely that we’ll ever determine exactly how the disease came to campus in the first place. It is easy to feel as if we can’t be affected because there are only a few cases of illness out of thousands of students, but for rare diseases or even accidents, we must remember that anyone is at risk. Second is the necessity to actively maintain our health. Granted, some people could not get the vaccine for medical reasons. But for those who elected not to participate for whatever reason, perhaps this could be an opportunity to learn about the principle behind and benefits to vaccination. I have heard many rumors and misconceptions over the past months. I certainly recognize that accurate information is necessary in order to trust something, so I would be happy to help anyone who wants to discuss the issues surrounding vaccination. On the other hand, just because most of us have been vaccinated does not mean that we should all neglect to wash our hands and share drinks with reckless abandon. Good hygiene prevents illness even in non-meningitis-outbreaks too. We are currently in flu season, and UHS has reported an increase in flu cases and 65 students with gastroenteritis last month alone. One troubling thing about the past months was some students’ inability or hesitancy to follow the outbreak and realize its significance before the national media began putting microphones in our faces and before we got calls from home frantically asking whether we were safe. Though it’s unlikely that another situation will be as serious and newsworthy as this one, it’s even less likely that we can count on external sources to shake us into action again. We are truly fortunate that none of the Princeton students who contracted the disease suffered serious consequences like amputations, let alone death. Let’s remember that many circumstances are out of our control, so it’s all the more important that we are taking care of the health factors that we can influence. There won’t always be a vaccine to bail us out. Thank you again to everyone who got both doses, and may you all remain committed to staying healthy.|~|Michael Kochis is the chair of the Student Health Advisory Board.

59222|~|Editorial: Pathway maintenance |~|   March 13 2014|~|Editorials Opinion |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The University prides itself on its beautiful campus filled with Gothic towers and buildings that serve as the ideal backdrop for a picturesque postcard. For the most part, these facilities are not only gorgeous and brimming with history, but they are also well kept and maintained. Yet, while Princeton revels in the beauty of its century old Gothic buildings, the University has been slow to respond to the more ugly side of aging: pathway deterioration. In light of the recent snow and ice storms, the Editorial Board would like to point out what has become increasingly obvious to any student walking around campus — that many pathways are in dire need of extensive and broad repairs. While the Facilities Operations Department does an admirable job shoveling and clearing pathways, the conditions of many pathways undermine these efforts, and thus, the safety of pedestrians and bikers. Thus, the Board would like to recommend that the University allocate funding to improve and maintain sidewalks and paths on campus and in front of University buildings. In recent years, Princeton University, with its annual operating budget of over $1 billion and an endowment in excess of $18 billion, has been able to expand and enlarge the campus with the construction of many new state-of-the-art buildings. These facilities, including the recently opened Neuroscience Institute and Peretsman-Scully Hall with a price tag of over $180 million dollars, are indeed a welcome addition to this campus. Yet, this costly expansion and renovation should not come at the expense of some of the more simple amenities any campus must be expected to provide. This winter, uneven, splintering walkways and an outdated drainage system have left many central pathways filled with ice or flooded as the thick snow began to melt. This ice and flooding is not simply a nuisance to people lacking the proper footwear but should be treated as a legitimate safety issue. The Editorial Board believes that while campus safety should respond immediately by closing the most affected pathways, the University should begin to plan long-term for renovating the grounds of the University. While new, state-of-the-art buildings are always welcome, students must first feel comfortable and secure in their ability to access them safely.|~|

59083|~|The case for Keystone|~|   March 11 2014|~|Column | March 11 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Duncan Hosie  Last week, nine University students were arrested while protesting the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project. Approval of the project, they argued, would be a dangerous and devastating blow to the environment. “We believe that a peaceful protest involving a lot of civil disobedience,” Nikolaus Hofer ’17 contended in a March 3 Prince article, “is the best course of action.” I offer a different perspective. The Keystone XL pipeline is a bipartisan, common-sense measure that is safe for the environment. More importantly, it would support middle and working-class families while providing a significant boost to the U.S. economy ($3.4 billion, according to the State Department). I echo the sentiments of President Bill Clinton, who argued “we should embrace [the project] and develop a stakeholder-driven system of high standards for doing the work.” American workers are struggling. Keystone XL will help them. According to the State Department, the “proposed project spending would support approximately 42,100 jobs.” Unemployment and underemployment remain far too high in this country, and this project would provide many hard-working Americans with high-paying wages in engineering, construction and pipeline maintenance. For this reason, America’s labor unions and labor leaders have endorsed the project, including Sean McGarvey, president of the North America’s Building Trade Unions, Leo W. Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, Cecil E. Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, and even Richard Trumka, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Currently, the United States imports over 300 million barrels of oil annually from unstable regimes in the Middle East and Latin America. This increases our dependence on turbulent regions worldwide and often negatively impacts our own domestic economy when order is not maintained. Although the University students protesting the Keystone XL pipeline may believe alternative forms of energy are a solution to this problem, the failure of federally subsidized green energy companies, such as Solyndra and Ener1, has proven that these alternatives are not yet sustainable on the private market. The United States will inevitably need to procure crude oil for a long time. The Keystone XL pipeline has the potential to reduce America’s dependence on unfriendly governments in favor of a trusted, stable ally. Would we not feel more comfortable getting our energy from Canada rather than from hostile nations overseas? From a national security standpoint, the benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline are unassailable. The students protesting the pipeline are promoting a false premise; they are arguing that President Obama has to decide between building a pipeline and not building a pipeline. However, that is not the decision the President faces. Indeed, The Wall Street Journal reports that Canadian companies are already working on developing an alternative to Keystone XL that would triple the amount of oil shipped to Canada’s west coast. Rather than going to the United States, “the boost will allow Asian buyers to load Canadian crude in significant volumes … and ship it across the Pacific.” Therefore, President Obama’s choice is whether to allow a pipeline to be built for the benefit of American consumers and workers or to force that pipeline to be built for the benefit of the Chinese. There are significant environmental benefits to opting for the former outcome. Extreme environmentalists love to create a false dichotomy between economic growth and environmental sustainability, yet Keystone XL would undeniably be beneficial for both. “Scientific American” concludes that “pipelines are generally regarded as a safe way to transport fuel, a far better alternative to tanker trucks or freight trains,” or shipping vessels. Pipelines are better constructed than other methods of transport (the Keystone XL pipeline is no exception with hundreds of millions of dollars spent on the most up-to-date technology) and, if a leakage ever did occur, it would be easier to clean up than an offshore spill. Of the 10 worst oil spills in history, nine were the result of an oil tanker or offshore rig explosion. The State Department has concluded that denying the Keystone XL pipeline “is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the [Canadian] oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States.” Because of this fact and the increased rate of oil spillage via non-pipeline transportation, the State Department has concluded that not building Keystone XL “could result in the release of up to 42 percent more greenhouse gases than would be released by building it.” Surely that is not an outcome that will guarantee victory in “the climate change battle,” which Mason Herson-Hord ’15 identified as one of the protestors’ goals. By protesting Keystone XL, those students were not protecting nature but rather harming our national security interests, economic growth and even environmental wellbeing. They were protesting against the wishes of a majority of Americans, 65 percent of whom, according to Pew Research, support Keystone XL, and they were protesting against economically vulnerable Americans, many of whom desperately need the high-paying jobs Keystone provides. The fate of Keystone XL rests with President Obama. He has waited long enough: it is now time to reject political extremism and approve this sensible, bipartisan project.|~|Duncan Hosie is a sophomore from Belvedere, Calif.

58915|~|Where are the student activists?|~|   March 11 2014|~|Column | Feb. 9 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|My underpants are showing.  I’m lying on the stairs of Frist Campus Center, during Late Meal, in an intentionally public display, and my underpants are showing.  And they brought a photographer. My underwear could be on the front page of The Daily Princetonian. I’d joined the Anti-Keystone XL pipeline “die-in” in Frist at the last minute. The email that Princeton United Left distributed to its associated campus groups had billed the protest as “short and sweet and risk-free.” Curious and desperately searching for something worth writing about in my column this week, I put on my black pants and black fleece and rushed over to Frist after organic chemistry precept, so I could finish the protest in time to get Late Meal. Besides thinking about my underpants, it occurred to me as I was lying there, pretending to be an oil spill, that this was the largest in-place expression of student political activism that I’d seen in my two years here. Despite the indisputable engagement of the University’s student body, seldom do we see large groups of students getting together for a large, visible protest in favor of or against some policy. Instead, we take actions in ways that seem far more becoming of Princeton students — working with ideas, behind the scenes and within the walls of academia, to make our voices heard, without undue personal inconvenience. Why march on Washington when you can join a scholarly discussion instead? Why picket up and down Nassau Street when there’s a sociology paper to write? While this more tame variety of activism is generally more amenable to our skills and inclinations as Princeton students, it lacks much of the urgency of large-scale, traditional protests, and is often shallow and weak in the face of the most important issues of our time. The University has a long, inconsistent history of radical political movements, dating back to Nassau Hall’s playing host to that daring experiment in democracy that was the United States government in 1783. Modern student activism at Princeton reached its zenith in 1970, when the University instituted a two-week fall break to allow students to participate in advocacy for that year’s presidential elections, in the wake of Nixon’s invasion of Cambodia that spring. As the protests — which ended in four deaths at Kent State University — raged, Princeton students went on strike to protest the invasion and the draft. The University supported them, delaying final papers and creating a two-week election break before that year’s election day. That fall, according to a 2011 article published in The Daily Princetonian, approximately a quarter of Princeton students participated in some kind of political campaign. Though student protests would never again reach the level it did in 1970, “election break” has remained a fixture to this day, an artifact of an age of radical activism. Today, University students express their political sentiments more subtle ways. Due to academic priorities, a desire for intellectual discussion over rash activism and our geographical distance from political centers in cities like Washington, D.C. and New York, we tend toward more subtle and non-confrontational acts of dissent. It’s easy to put my name on a petition — so why not sign every petition that comes my way, from J Street U’s petition supporting the two-state solution to Cory Booker’s senate election petition? Slightly more time-consuming is taking the time to attend a talk by a political speaker, whether it be Richard Falk, Justice Scalia or Ben Bernanke. Those of us who are extremely committed may volunteer our time to political causes, but still at our convenience, with academics taking priority. As a nominal member of the Princeton University College Democrats, I receive a steady stream of emails about volunteer opportunities with this congressional candidate or that cause, each of which I can commit a free evening to. Perhaps these efforts are a better use of our time and energy. There is, indeed, less need to leave campus as activism has spread to the Internet. President Obama owes much of his successful presidential campaigns to the armies of volunteers cultivated and coordinated online; some public advocacy campaigns exist solely online. In a column published on March 5, Aaron Robertson discussed “dry-erase board activism” in the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign, a tactic adopted by the Princeton DREAM team, which is a powerful means of raising awareness. Just as we feel confident as students working within the system to change it, we feel confident as millennials in working virtually to change reality. But all too often the challenges we face are too real and too large for virtual, gradual activism to change them. After the protest, I asked Mason Herson-Hord ‘15, one of the protest leaders who had been arrested at the White House the week prior, why public protest and civil disobedience were necessary. He cited the “apocalyptic” consequences of global warming, claiming “nothing else would matter” if the full effects of climate change were realized. Fellow protest leader Katie Horvath‘15 added that it was so urgent that “the time to act was yesterday”. You, dear reader, have an issue you are deeply passionate about. It may not be climate change, but the time to act on it was yesterday, and the world is changing all too slowly. If you don’t take action now, the consequences could be apocalyptic. Go march, sit, stand, die and live. But, unlike me, remember your belt.|~|
59067|~|Letter to the Editor: Questioning the question|~|   March 11 2014|~|Letter to the Editor | March 11 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|I am writing in response to your March 10 editorial “Evaluating the ‘Admission Opportunity Campaign.’ ” In appraising the information and arguments that we as Students for Prison Education and Reform have made available as part of the Admissions Opportunity Campaign, the Editorial Board latched on to one peripheral point of the campaign. In doing so, it failed to accurately represent and evaluate the campaign’s central focus. In its article, the Editorial Board focuses on the ways in which diversity could be affected by the removal of the question related to past criminal convictions from the undergraduate admissions application. The aim of our campaign is the removal of such a question, based on the belief that the question’s inclusion perpetuates the socioeconomically discriminatory effects of the U.S. criminal justice system. Adding the diverse perspectives of students with past involvement with the justice system to our campus community would be an indirect positive consequence of removing the fundamentally unjust question. In its current form, the application question asks: “Have you ever been adjudicated guilty or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or other crime? Note that you are not required to answer “yes” to this question, or provide an explanation, if the criminal adjudication or conviction has been expunged, sealed, annulled, pardoned, destroyed, erased, impounded, or otherwise ordered by a court to be kept confidential.” Persons obligated to answer “yes” to the question are then provided with space to explain their conviction in whatever way they see fit. We believe that this question is flawed in multiple ways. By asking about a diverse range of convictions, the question includes persons who were convicted for crimes that did not result in imprisonment, namely crimes of a nonviolent nature. This negatively discriminates towards certain applicants, as studies have shown that law enforcement tactics across the United States target certain socioeconomic areas with intense police surveillance while other areas experience little to no regular police scrutiny. Many students applying to Princeton have partaken in illegal activities. Due to a combination of luck and circumstance, however, few of these applicants have criminal records. By asking about past convictions, Princeton is not asking who has committed a crime, but rather who has been arrested and punished for these crimes by a demonstrably inequitable justice system. Furthermore, economically privileged youth who are convicted of crimes have access to dedicated, experienced, expensive legal counsel and therefore enjoy a greater chance of getting their conviction sealed or expunged than applicants from less privileged backgrounds. When it comes to those who have been incarcerated, a person’s ability to change over time is something to be valued and would be incorporated within the larger narrative of the application. Applicants would be free to explain the gap in their academic and extracurricular activities in the personal statement or other essay sections. By removing the current binary question, Princeton would stop disincentivizing students from applying while still providing avenues through which applicants could explain their personal stories. The same high standard of admission would continue to apply to all applicants, but applicants would be judged by various complex appraisals of personal merit, including personal essays, extracurricular activities and letters of recommendation, instead of a question that yields responses more linked to external socioeconomic factors than individual merit. In light of the inequitable and ineffective nature of the U.S. criminal justice system, we believe that the question related to past involvement with the justice system should be removed from the Princeton undergraduate application for admission. As an institution of higher learning dedicated to bettering society through education, Princeton should strive to base its admissions standards on fair evaluation of an applicant’s personal character and academic ability. Given that the information received from the question related to past convictions is flawed, it is best to remove this question. Our campaign does not seek to admit persons with past convictions, but rather to give them the opportunity to compete equally with other applicants. The Editorial Board notes that other aspects of the application are also biased against the less privileged. The bias in other sections of the application does not excuse maintaining a biased question regarding past involvement with the justice system. And as the recently announced changes to the SAT demonstrate, there is momentum within the higher education community to make the college admissions process more equitable. The question asking about past convictions was added to the Common Application in 2006 without direct official consent from Princeton. Prior to 2006, Princeton was the same place, a tranquil university with low levels of campus crime. No campus discussion was held in 2006 in order to assess the effects of inclusion of this question on the University’s official application for undergraduate admission. It is time to have that conversation. In doing so, Princeton can maintain its role as a leader in higher education by promoting inclusive admissions standards.

58933|~|Editorial: Evaluating the “Admission Opportunity Campaign”|~|   March 9 2014|~|Editorial | March 9 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Last week, the University’s Students for Prison and Education Reform began circulating a petition, titled the Admission Opportunity Campaign, calling on the University to change its admissions practices. In light of racial and socioeconomic inequalities found in the United States criminal justice system, the petition asks the University to remove all questions about past involvement with the justice system from the undergraduate admission application. University Spokesperson Martin Mbugua wrote in an email to the Board that the admissions office currently uses the information as part of a “holistic review of the applicant.” “If a student checks yes on the misconduct and/or conviction question, the additional essay explaining the circumstances informs our decision. We read and assess every file individually, and the fact that the misconduct and/or conviction box has been checked does not automatically disqualify a student from being admitted,” Mbugua wrote. With this information, we, the Board, recognize SPEAR’s petition as well intentioned but poorly informed. We endorse the admission office’s current process for considering misconduct and convictions. Moreover, we believe the Common Application’s format, which has students who have had involvement in the justice system check a box indicating their involvement and write an essay explaining the circumstances under which misconduct or a conviction occurred, is well suited to provide fair and useful information for admissions offices. The Admission Opportunity Campaign’s strongest argument is that a history with the justice system is an unfair and biased metric. Thus, if prospective students with criminal backgrounds are rejected on account of such a history alone, those students who sincerely want to turn over a new leaf by means of education will be denied the opportunity. The Board recognizes this is true but does not conclude we should reject questions about criminal records as useful tools for evaluating potential students. The admissions office places value on high grades, exceptional test scores and challenging high school curricula. Nonetheless, these indicators of student performance carry similar biases against students who are too busy working to spend adequate time on schoolwork, unable to afford tutoring or born in locations that lack well-funded schools. We accept them as valuable tools in the admissions office’s toolbox because, despite their bias against the less privileged, they provide information to the University of a potential student’s performance at Princeton. The Board observes that knowledge of an applicant’s history with the justice system, especially within the context of the explanatory essay, can be useful for the admissions office and believes the University has the right to request that students provide such information. The essay section is especially valuable, as it enables applicants to tell their full stories to admissions counselors so that counselors can evaluate the convictions given the context of the applicants’ explanation and background, just as the admissions office considers outside circumstances when evaluating high school achievement. The Board sees two primary ways in which knowledge of a student’s involvement in the justice system might contribute to the admission office’s holistic review of applicants. First, it might indicate a student’s likelihood of committing crimes on campus. The Admission Opportunity Campaign attempts to refute this notion, claiming there isn’t empirical evidence to indicate screening improves on-campus safety and that 97 percent of students who engage in misconduct do not report criminal records. We reject this assertion. Its first claim comes from an unpublished dissertation and contradicts a reasonable inference that students who have committed a violent crime in the past would in the future. The Board believes the 97 percent statistic is misleading and uninformative without knowledge of what percent of a student body does or does not have a criminal record. If 99 percent of the student body lacked a criminal record, for example, the statistic would indicate that individuals with records commit crimes on campus at a higher rate than those without records. Many teenagers who commit nonviolent crimes are, in fact, one-time offenders. However, in the campaign to protect these students, we cannot assume that all offenders fall into this category. The Board is especially concerned about individuals who have committed violent crimes such as sexual assault. Thus, the Board finds SPEAR’s argument unconvincing and encourages the University to continue considering past convictions. The second effect of the admissions office having knowledge of a student’s involvement in the justice system might actually benefit less privileged applicants who have been discriminated against by biased law enforcement. The Board believes that a well-authored essay explaining hardship as an explanation of past misconduct or conviction has the potential to add another dimension to someone’s application and enables the admission office to see that such a student could bring valuable viewpoints to the University’s classrooms. Moreover, SPEAR recognizes diversity as a goal to strive for, but we wonder how SPEAR expects the admission office to increase the number of students who have had past involvement with the justice system if the admission office is unaware of applicants’ pasts. The Board would like to join SPEAR in advocating for an increase of Princeton students with past involvement with the America’s flawed justice system. We recognize their enrollment as a powerful means of both individual and systemic reform. However, we do not believe removing the application question is the best means to improve the situation of these applicants or the University. Cara Eckholm and Brandon Holt abstained.

58922|~|Letter to the Editor: March 9, 2014|~|   March 9 2014|~|Letter to the Editor | March 9 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|To the Editors: We are writing in response to your March 5 editorial, “Transparency regarding mental health forced withdrawals.” University Health Services and the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students work closely with campus partners, including residential college staff and the Office of Disability Services, to mitigate student health and safety risks through support services on and off campus. We have a comprehensive array of accessible, responsive and well-utilized services, which have received high levels of satisfaction in student surveys. Our missions are based on removing obstacles to student success. We use all available resources to help students stay in school even as they may be going through very difficult times. Most students are able to use this help and thrive in school without needing to withdraw. However, there are very rare instances where the University’s support network cannot meet the intensive needs of a student and the student’s danger to himself or herself remains extremely high. In these situations, students require a different and more comprehensive level of care that is not consistent with staying in school. The University’s policies regarding voluntary and involuntary withdrawal describe how these rare, sensitive and difficult situations may be approached. As the Undergraduate Announcement states, in part: “Princeton provides a range of support services to address the medical and mental health needs of students within the context of the campus community. On occasion, students may experience health needs requiring a level of care that exceeds what the University can appropriately provide. In such circumstances, some students may be advised to consider a voluntary withdrawal. In situations where a student is unable or unwilling to carry out substantial self-care obligations or presents a substantial risk of self-harm or harm to others, and the student declines to voluntarily withdraw, the dean of undergraduate students has the authority to place the student on an involuntary withdrawal. Such decisions may be appealed in writing to the vice president of campus life.” During our years at the University, we have seen staff taking every possible measure to keep students in school safely and able to complete their academic requirements. Individual situations are unique, and every circumstance and factor known to the University is considered on an individual basis. The Editorial Board is right to be concerned about inaccurate and unintended messages that deter students from accessing necessary mental health care. Our advice to students who may be struggling or have fears about what will happen if they seek help is this: There is no better way to get accurate information about Princeton’s support services and policies than going right to the source. Schedule a meeting with your director of student life. Talk to your residential college adviser. Make an appointment at Counseling and Psychological Services with a clinician or the director. Make an appointment with the UHS director. Please engage the resources that are here for you. There are many highly trained staff members at Princeton who want the very best for students who are struggling with mental health concerns.

58910|~|Outside the Bubble: Questioning the case against marriage equality|~|   March 9 2014|~|Column | March 9 |~|David Will|~|None|~|Every possible sign points toward the inevitability of gay marriage’s nationwide legalization. A new Washington Post/ABC poll found that 59 percent of Americans support same sex marriage, a new record and a complete reversal from a decade earlier. The federal government alone provides 1,138 protections and benefits for married couples. Beyond the law, marriage is a stabilizing force for families. Gay marriage advocates are fighting with increasing success to extend those benefits to same-sex couples. A slew of challenges to state bans on same-sex marriage have the potential to reach the Supreme Court. Collectively, the legal challenges may spur the Supreme Court to declare a federal right to same-sex marriage as early as June 2015. I will address the constitutional case for marriage equality in a follow-up column to come. But first it’s important to address the philosophical and social science claims that underlie the legal arguments against same-sex marriage. Princeton politics professor Robert George, regarded as the most formidable defender of what he terms “traditional marriage,” justifies limiting marriage to between one man and one woman because of their capacity to reproduce, even if the couple is infertile. Encouraging exclusively conjugal sex, according to his argument, preserves marriage’s integrity because intercourse is not treated as a good in itself. The biological capacity to reproduce is the higher good that makes heterosexual, monogamous marriage a unique and vital institution. George presumably holds this view because he wishes to foster a society in which the couples who marry also become excellent parents. I’d tend to agree with the goal, but not the method. Limiting marriage to between a man and a woman in order to promote child rearing presupposes that the biological capacity to conceive a child — or to behave in a way to do so — is necessary to parent well. In this day and age, the ability to have children — or, again, to act as if you can — is in itself neither sufficient nor necessary to create and maintain a loving family. It would seem that a legitimate marriage would be one that encourages sexual conduct that generally affirms more profound ends. George repeatedly argues that love — along with the procreative element — is the greater good. However, limiting truly meaningful sex to vaginal intercourse debases the very institution of marriage that George intends to protect. The singular fixation on legitimate sex as a potentially procreative act reduces it to a purely physical exercise. Lawyers defending gay marriage bans across the country repeatedly argue that states have a compelling interest in limiting the institution so that it is conducive to child rearing, which means excluding same-sex couples. Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, conducted the most recent and widely-cited study that purports to prove that gays and lesbians are inferior parents. In fact, he recently testified in a court challenge to Michigan’s gay marriage ban. Regnerus’ prominence implies that his work is the standard by which accusations against same-sex parenting capabilities should be assessed. The study itself, the New Family Structures Study, alleges that the children of gay couples lead significantly worse lives than kids brought up by heterosexual parents. As it turns out, the study is sloppily structured and misleading in its results: The study categorizes a child as having grown up in a same sex household if either parent has ever had a same-sex relationship during that child’s first 18 years of life. But an even deeper structural flaw yielded the work’s extreme conclusions. Among the children who reported living with what the study would term a “gay father,” less than half reported also living with the father’s male partner for longer than four months. Less than 2 percent of the same subset of children said they lived with both partners for at least three years. These percentages are mirrored by the sample of children raised by lesbian parents. Only a handful of the children who are supposedly products of same-sex families actually spent their entire childhoods with two specific parents of the same gender. The study’s structure and those who cite its results perpetuate a circular, pernicious logic. Regnerus’ work only reaffirms the grave social and economic costs of unstable households on children, not the inherent deficiencies of same-sex parents. William Saletan of Slate writes that “the study doesn’t document the failure of same-sex marriage. It documents the failure of the closeted, broken, and unstable households that preceded same-sex marriage.” If those who cite the study are sincerely troubled by its results, then they shouldn’t withhold the solution — marriage — from those whom they blame for the problem in the first place. Actual evidence of gay and lesbian parental ineptitude remains illusive, yet dire warnings of harms to children are invoked in courts of law to prevent same-sex marriage. Time is on the side of those who believe that parental rights should accompany marriage equality. Gay marriage’s expansion across the country means that the number of alternative households will also increase. As same-sex couples settle down and start families, they will shatter prejudice with dignity, simply by loving their children.|~|David Will is a religion major from Chevy Chase, Md.

58884|~|Applying to Princeton|~|   March 7 2014|~|Column | March 7 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Grace Li In my recent tutoring session at a New Jersey prison, my student was analyzing an author’s portrayal of brotherhood. I found myself wishing that he had access to professors I know who would push and probe him even more than I did and a whole class of my peers who have helped cultivate my ability to formulate arguments and ideas. When my student responded to, “You can make it to college if you keep working hard,” with “Maybe I’ll see you at Princeton,” I saw the glass ceiling beneath my feet. I thought, “The system is rigged against you, they’ll never let you in — we’ll never let you in.” Instead I said, “I’m a senior, so I’ll have graduated.” He would not get in. When applying to the University, we all had to indicate whether we had been “adjudicated guilty or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony or other crime” unless, of course, our records had been expunged. Though one checked box does not necessarily disavow an entire application, given Princeton’s low acceptance rate, he and others in a similar situation do not have a chance. In fact, they are being disincentivized to apply or even think about applying. These potential students, correctly, see a near-zero probability of being chosen over countless other applicants with similar qualifications and a spotless record. During my second year at Princeton, I began to volunteer as a tutor in New Jersey prisons through the Petey Greene Prisoner Assistance Program. Through working weekly with students, many of whom are at least my equals in intellect and personal strength, I have come to recognize that my opportunity to be at Princeton came largely from winning the birth lottery. By chance, I was born to educated parents who benefited from China’s first recent easing of emigration restrictions. They relocated to a country in which I would have greater opportunities and carefully chose their residences based on the quality of school district. They offered me freedom to explore and gave me constant emotional, financial and logistical support. Fate and my parents’ choices have peopled my world with teachers, mentors and friends who have made my life stimulating and happy. These people, whom I consider “my team,” have done everything possible to help me succeed in a way that has landed me at Princeton. My current situation is as much a result of my hard work as of my luck. Many who fared worse in the birth lottery were born poor and/or non-white, born into the types of families that do not feed into Princeton, born into communities neglected by businesses and political representatives but targeted by the criminal justice system. One in four Americans has had contact with the justice system. The way the justice system treats these Americans depends on their background and factors outside of their control. As one example, black and white people use marijuana at similar rates but black people are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. Those with restricted access to Princeton due to “criminal pasts” are not making choices so different from ours. Growing up, my friends and I spent lawless weekends and summers in the Swarthmore woods and each other’s basements in Rose Valley, Pa., an East Coast suburb so small and quaint that it does not have a police force. My classmates had parents who were pro bono lawyers, but had defense attorneys who were expensive experts at keeping these teenagers’ slates clean. Having expunged records perpetuated the very same privilege that afforded access to these top-notch attorneys. I am here, and my students from Petey Greene are in prison. Now that I am here, it is easy to think that the system is flawless. After all, it accepted me, so why question it? We form miniature social and extracurricular institutions on campus – eating clubs, student groups – where access is restricted because access is precious. The existing members have some proven value, so only the most worthy can gain access to their – our – time. Our desire to protect the quality of a group breeds trust in the selectivity as well as the selection process and structure. In admissions we trust, especially, because we have been admitted. The entire process aims to pick out the best – not only those who will succeed at Princeton and make the most of this opportunity, but also those worthy of accessing the existing resources including, prominently, the human resources. Who deserves to explore ideas with this swath of outstandingly intelligent, creative, and hardworking students? Who should have the chance to build friendships with people with immense social capital? Who is worthy of access to peers who may become some of the most powerful business partners, political allies, our generation’s influential thinkers and artists, the ideal colleagues? Access changes lives. When I was applying to colleges, my mother’s American friend warned her that only kids with the “right granddaddies” got accepted to my chosen schools. Unfazed I vowed to start my own legacy. After (almost) four years of integrating into the seat of (almost) paradisiacal privilege, I recognize the possible future trajectories Princeton opens. At the same time, volunteering through Petey Greene has shown me the trajectories that involvement with the justice system closes. Knowing this, I no longer feel as strongly about being the head of some vertical line of privilege, as my hypothetical children will too by chance be born into privilege. I want to share the access to privilege, now, with others who have fared worse in the birth lottery. There are countless inequalities that make the road to Princeton difficult, but there is action we can take. We can resist keeping our gates closed to those who by chance have had too little opportunity thus far in their lives. The Admissions Opportunity Campaign calls on Princeton to lessen the barrier by removing all questions about past involvement with the justice system from the undergraduate application for admission. It is one step for our university to take toward acting truly in the nation’s service.|~|Grace Li is a Wilson School major from Media, Pa.

58735|~|The invisible minority|~|   March 6 2014|~|Column | March 6 |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|This column is the second in a series about socioeconomic diversity and low-income students at the University. Signing into Terrace Club was one of the best decisions I could have made this year. The people are awesome, the food is delicious, and it’s just a chill place to be. Admittedly, though, I still had to face the universally stressful facet of every eating club: sophomore dues. Though I knew I would have to pay dues this semester, I wasn’t actively thinking about it. Perhaps I imagined the financial aid office would help cover the fees, like they do junior and senior year, or maybe I thought the fee would be small. You can imagine my surprise and panic when I was slapped with an $800 due expected by the end of February. I called the financial aid office but was told the most they could do was offer me a loan and attempt to lower the amount if I didn’t meet my student summer savings amount. The next person I contacted was the assistant bookkeeper at Terrace who told me I could pay in three installments, after which I felt much less panicky. Still, what would have happened had I joined a club that did not offer this option? This is just one example of how low-income students’ experiences at the University are unique in ways other students may not even realize. When I reject a last-minute invite to go to a Kanye concert for “only” $100 or reluctantly split a check evenly among a large group of friends when I pointedly got a cheaper meal than everyone else, the subtext is so subtle that most people from different socioeconomic backgrounds don’t realize it exists. And from here, it is simple for unawareness of experiences of low-income students to translate to unawareness of the presence of low-income students in general. Having a minority status means just that: Your numbers are smaller, and therefore more effort is required so that your voice is heard. But unlike racial minorities, and even some religious minorities, there is no simple physical demarcation that says, “You’re a low-income student” (unless you’re very good at telling the difference between Old Navy and Sevens jeans). This isn’t necessarily a bad thing — people don’t want to be reduced to and identified by one piece of their lives. But because it’s only our personal experiences that are unique, rather than physical differences, it is almost as if low-income students aren’t here. Ironically, this lower visibility is partially the result of one of the University’s greatest attributes — its amazing financial aid program. Students whose family incomes are lower than $60,000 — already well above the national median income — receive full tuition, room and board covered by the University. The average grant begins to decrease above the $60,000 mark, but it remains fairly generous still. Thus, the University does as much as possible to ensure that students are on financially equal footing in paying for their college education. But I find that much of university support for low-income and first-generation students stops with its widely lauded financial aid program. Once the tuition bill is paid in full, it is tempting to say our financial differences are then null and abandon the discussion all together. But receiving money for college does not mean the end of being low-income, and neither should it mean the end of acknowledgement of this status. However, discussing what it means to be low-income is generally taboo. This is not to say the University is willfully ignorant. I think it has room for improvement in addressing and discussing diversity in a number of forms. Socioeconomic diversity is simply the least obvious and, as such, the easiest to put on the back burner. Undoubtedly, the students here are ambitious. If they feel as if the University is missing something that could have a positive impact on campus culture, they take the initiative to create a new conversation. But taking the first steps to create a campus culture that embraces socioeconomic diversity is a difficult endeavor. A student’s socioeconomic status is not a defining characteristic, but it is a significant one that has affected personal experiences and interactions with the world for years. Sensitivity and fear of being stigmatized (or worse, endlessly sympathized) can be a deterrent from getting involved in student groups concerning low-income and first-generation experiences, or creating a new organization. And while Princeton has always boasted their self-starting students, a large portion of responsibility rests with the University to help make campus a safe, accepting place where students are comfortable enough to begin talking. Because of the silence from both the student body and the administration, the image and experiences of a low-income student at Princeton are obscure. What comes to your mind? Hopefully you haven’t conjured up a picture of a 20-something-year-old Oliver Twist, asking for a bit more porridge at Rocky dining hall. But on the opposite side of the spectrum is … nothing. You have no idea what being a low-income student entails because it never crosses your mind. Both of these scenarios are bad. We want to move from ignorance to understanding the unique experiences and perspectives of low-income students as people. By doing so, we break down the stereotypes that low-income students may face. We also invalidate the image of Princeton as an institution only for the rich and privileged and encourage prospective students to apply. The University has a major stake in transforming this image, then. Still, the time it takes to implement such change can often be so great that it hinders efficiently addressing issues. Here is when simultaneous student group initiatives take the forefront, proving that while individual efforts are often fruitless, there is always power in numbers.  I am personally involved in Princeton University Quest Scholars Network as president and liaison. PUQSN is only a campus chapter that constitutes the national Quest Scholars Network, which aims to provide academic and professional resources for current undergraduate scholars while increasing the accessibility of higher education overall. Our campus chapter, though, also aims to create a sense of community for students here, through community service initiatives, study breaks and our mentor/mentee program. Our events help create a place where the floor is not only open but also comfortable enough for members to talk about their Princeton experience. We soon discover that while our similar socioeconomic backgrounds are what initially brought us together, we all share much more in common and realize these backgrounds are only a small part of our stories. And now, PUQSN is no longer an anomaly on this campus. Two other student groups representing low-income and first-generation students have recently been created and are officially recognized by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students. Among them are the Gates Millennium Scholars, a scholarship that covers a student’s undergraduate education and sometimes even graduate school, depending on the student’s area of study. There is also a Princeton chapter of Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, which is comprised of students who participated in the college preparatory program. Co-founder of the campus chapter, Kujegi Camara ’16, says she felt a need for the student group after her first few weeks at Princeton left her shocked at campus culture and the sense of alienation low-income and first-generation students can feel. At the same time, Camara says, “It’s easy for Princeton to strip you of your other identities to where you’re only a Princetonian. LEDA, and student groups in general, help you return to these other pieces of yourself.” It’s challenging to do this when you feel as if you are alone in your experiences, however, and this has been the motivation of creating student group conglomerate. Together, PUQSN, LEDA, Gates Millennium and affiliated student groups, have been working together to create a council — named Princeton’s Hidden Minority Council — under which student groups with an interest in low-income and first-generation Princeton students, current and prospective, could fall. The hope for this council is two-fold: getting more student members to become more active in their respective organizations and centralizing campus resources for them, while creating large-scale events and campaigns on campus to engage with students who are not low-income or first-generation. A major player in creating this council has been Brittney Watkins ’16, the other co-founder of the Princeton chapter of LEDA. “With the stress of home, work here, extracurriculars and actual academic life, I really wanted to create a space where students can come and say this is what I’m dealing with, and it’s okay that I’m dealing with it. And I think it’s important other students are aware of this experience.” Watkins says that efforts to raise awareness on and off campus have also been a major driver in creating the group. Student efforts have recently been mirrored in the administration. University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 has recently attended a White House summit for increasing college opportunity for low-income and first-generation students. Several faculty members, such as Vice President for Campus Life Cynthia Cherrey, Dean of the College Valerie Smith, Associate Dean of the College Diane McKay and Deputy Dean of Undergraduate Students Thomas Dunne have been very supportive of these student initiatives and making campus a generally better place for low-income students. They are open and extremely responsive to suggestions and criticisms we have had and have even been active participants in our respective organizations. This past weekend, the treasurer and the community service chair of PUQSN, Dallas Nan ’16 and Ana Maldonado ’16, attended the second annual First Generation College Student Summit at Amherst College in Massachusetts. On speaking about the importance of the PHMC, Nan says, “Establishing a foundation from the moment students enter this campus, making it safe for students to express this facet of themselves, is paramount. We can’t successfully get to the root of the problem if we don’t stop the faux pas associated with the identity at the beginning.” This problem of perception, though, only applies to low-income students who make it to campus at all.  It still remains that low-income students are not properly represented in the student demographic. As Bennett McIntosh wrote in his column, “In the service of the nation’s students,” Princeton students in the lowest university bracket, $60,000 and below, only comprise 15.8 percent of the population, while the median income for U.S. families in 2012 was $51,371. The discrepancy is overwhelmingly vast. Princeton remains responsible in shifting recruitment and admissions policy to get low-income students on campus initially. While Princeton awaits this change in admissions policy, student groups are joining forces to reshape the way we look at the low-income experience and create a sustained base of understanding and support. The University is actively advocating these efforts, and nationally actions are being taken to support low-income students, including both prospective and current undergraduates. The experience of what Princeton would consider a low-income family is far from unusual in the United States. Hopefully, as the University dedicates itself to a more accurate demographic representation of society, the lives and experiences of students on campus will come to better reflect those of young adults across the nation.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La.

58608|~|Erasable expressions |~|   March 5 2014|~|Column | March 5 |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|The Tumblr page for the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign that launched last week has already attracted thousands of page views. The initiative began last spring when Harvard sophomore Kimiko Matsuda-Lawrence interviewed Black undergraduates to gauge their responses to life on campus. As a supplement to Matsuda-Lawrence’s play inspired by these conversations, the Tumblr features photographs of African-American students holding dry-erase boards with racist remarks that were either directed toward them, or that they otherwise overhead on campus. Having received positive feedback, organizers of the campaign have been contacted by Black students on other campuses, including the University of Pennsylvania, some of whom would like to recreate the project within their own communities. Of course, the manifestation of the project is not itself new. A couple of years ago, for example, YouTube was an especially visible forum for individuals (most of whom were adolescents) to communicate a personal narrative through a series of index cards. These narratives were often deeply affecting, as they dealt with such issues as bullying, depression and suicide. Unfortunately, some of the youth who had made these videos subsequently took their own lives, even though many had sought psychiatric help and expressed feeling happier only days before these tragedies. If you were to scroll beneath the videos, you would cross into the jungle of the Internet, where sympathy seems to always be forced out of the room by invisible aggressors. Some YouTubers would upload “mock sad stories” that showed them exaggerating their “afflictions.” Evidently, these people had no empathy for an unorthodox, yet nonetheless genuine, display of pain. While I do not mean to suggest that these silent expressions of discontent seek the same ends, I am interested in this voicelessness as a mode of communication and even as a tool for social and individual change. On the “I, Too, Am Harvard” Tumblr, a message on the home page details the campaign’s goal of “highlighting the faces and voices of black students at Harvard College.” At first, it is perhaps tempting to dismiss the initiative as an experiment that perpetuates a trendy expression of frustration. I myself have questioned the efficacy of index cards and dry-erase boards to communicate something that might encourage action or reform in other people. Although I was touched by the stories of people who had been hurt by others, I never felt as though I could do more than shrug and think, “Hope everything works out.” The immediate success of the student campaign, however, indicates a few interesting things. First is the unspoken truth that a widely known institution or organization is likely the best platform for underrepresented people to tell stories that will probably be heard. Where one child recording a video in his basement may primarily reach people within his own community, students at a place like Harvard (and Princeton, etc.) simply need to whisper, and thousands of people will hear. I would like to emphasize the plurality of “students” which relates to my second point. I suspect that the power of voiceless crusades rests in the interlocked hands of the many. Each photograph in the student campaign is an echo of the one that precedes it, a magnification of individual pain that stretches down the computer screen. This mode of expression is particularly beneficial for members of minority groups who share similarly discomforting experiences. As I looked through the photographs, I read many statements that I hadn’t personally heard, and quite a few that were too familiar. The power of the photographs derive from their visual and textual resonance. One sees, for instance, a young Black man in a hoodie and is reminded of the stereotypes that are imposed on him. As if this were not enough, the dry-erase board displays a checklist of stereotypes: “thug,” “ghetto,” “hood” and “ratchet,” to name a few. Reading the stark, handwritten statements is similar to reading a powerful line in a story that is enhanced by the absence of sound. Likewise, interpreting the oft-ambivalent expressions of the person who holds the board can be like analyzing a painted portrait; one wishes he could know how the subject felt in that moment, but the moment is gone, now only preserved in an image. I am glad that other schools want to incorporate this very modern brand of expression in their own communities. While the Harvard students focused on the issue of race, I can imagine how college students might also use dry-erase boards to emphasize any kind of personal issue that may be difficult to speak about. In the wake of the recent Penn student suicides, one might be compelled to create a powerful display that exhibits the frustrations and anxieties of all students who feel pressure to perform well academically and socially. These kinds of initiatives may yield the intangible profit of knowing that one has sympathetic peers in colleges across the nation. The “dry-erase model,” though familiar, becomes more relevant when many people use it for the same goal. It is a model that I support and one that will hopefully result in more dialogues about student well-being in times to come.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich.

58591|~|A damaging dichotomy of gender norms|~|   March 5 2014|~|Column | Mar. 5 |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|One of the first emails I received from my residential college adviser upon my matriculation to the University was a list of the bathroom codes for Holder Hall — bathroom codes that I would never need to use myself but was only given so that I could be a resource to visiting female friends. As a male, I do not need to type in a four-digit access code to use my restroom like my female counterparts; unlike those outside the women’s restrooms, the keypads installed outside the doors of the men’s restrooms within Princeton, although present, are entirely for show. Anyone who has lived in one of the University’s dormitories has noticed this phenomenon, and my search through the annals of The Daily Princetonian revealed that I am not the first student to comment on it in my column. Where my dispute with this bathroom bias differs from my predecessors, however, is that while their main concern is the archaic view of females as delicate and helpless that this policy tolerates, mine is the ideals of “American” masculinity that the bathroom code discrepancy upholds. Whether consciously or not, Princeton’s discriminatory distribution of bathroom codes has institutionalized a damaging dichotomy of gender norms at the University. As I have pointed out, the feminine side of this argument has been previously discussed by this publication — once in 2011 by Luke Massa ’13 and once more in 2012 by Rebecca Kreutter. What has been left unaddressed is that by placing codes on women’s bathrooms while neglecting them on men’s has sustained the damaging belief that men cannot be victims of sexual assault. The codes were originally introduced to the University in 1978 (according to Luke Massa’s column) to protect recently admitted females from sexual assault and have endured since even with the installment of the prox system. It is unsurprising that University administrators were primarily concerned with the safety of their female population — men are dominant, men are masculine and men cannot be sexually harassed. At least, that’s what the preservation of these gendered safety measures would imply. But even if the University’s bathroom code policy suggests that males are safe from sexual predation, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network estimates that at least 10 percent of victims of sexual assault are male. And even this statistic is, unfortunately, most likely low; the prejudice implied by University bathroom codes is simply a symptom of a larger, national stigma that causes men who experience sexual abuse of any kind to feel “feminized” and ashamed, reducing the number of incidents officially reported.  Americans’ association of sexual assault with the female gender causes serious psychological repercussions and cultural stigmatization for our men who are victims. Inundated with the perception that “men don’t get raped,” male victims are likely to question their own masculinity or sexuality and to feel humiliated and responsible for their assault and for not being “manly” enough to combat the attack. The University’s discrepancy between female and male bathroom codes promotes this sentiment, tying manhood to sexual dominance and implicitly conveying the message that to be sexually assaulted as a man undermines one’s male identity. It is unacceptable for the University to endorse this misconception, even if indirectly. The University stance regarding bathroom codes must be reconsidered to help advance public perception of the possibility of sexual assault regardless of gender and to better reflect University dedication to the equal safety of all students. The motivation behind entrance codes only to female restrooms must be reevaluated and aligned with progressive evidence of the sexless danger of sexual assault. With the implementation of the prox system, perhaps the danger of predators from outside the University community has been almost entirely reduced, and therefore bathroom codes can be completely eliminated on campus. Should the University administration discover some pertinent reason, such as privacy or protection, to continue utilizing codes to access restrooms, then it must react in an ungendered manner. Of course, there are times when the preservation of gender differences is necessary for effective policy decisions, but the safety of the student body population is certainly not one. Continued practice of female-only bathroom codes only sustains, however quietly, a destructive ideal of what it means to be a man.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

58578|~|Improving Mental Health Week |~|   March 5 2014|~|Column | March 5 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Monday marked the beginning of Mental Health Week, a USG-sponsored initiative that seeks to “increase awareness of mental wellness by connecting students with information about campus resources, reduce the stigma regarding seeking help and start and maintain a positive dialogue that is crucial to a safe and supporting community.” Through their various events, which range from talks and workshops to recreational activities, the Princeton Mental Health Initiative raises awareness about mental health issues on campus, invites students to foster an environment conducive to open dialogue and provides strategies for students to nurture their own mental well-being. However, the challenge lies not only in raising awareness about ways to improve mental wellness but also about changing the mindset of students in regard to these services. On Tuesday, The Daily Princetonian published an Editorial titled “Transparency regarding mental health forced withdrawals.” Raising concerns about students who may hesitate or refrain from seeking help out of fear, the Editorial Board called for increased transparency on the conditions under which the University requires students with mental health issues to leave campus. Efforts to raise awareness about how students may go about seeking to improve their mental wellness can only do so much when students are afraid to utilize such services. It is difficult to encourage students to seek help when there are concerns, substantiated or not, about the negative consequences for doing so. Worse still, students are wary of not only seeking help through the various groups and services offered by the University but also of reaching out to their more direct community of peers and friends. Herein lies the fundamental problem: At its best, Princeton is a rigorous academic institution that encourages students to be independent and self-sufficient. At its worst, it creates a stifling, competitive environment wherein students feel that they must always put their best foot forward — that everyone else appears to be doing just fine, and so they must also appear to be fine. A cartoon by Adam Mastroianni, published back in December, was particular striking. Two stick figures list off the day-to-day struggles students face but change tones instantly when an admitted student asks about attending Princeton. We seem to dismiss our insecurities and complaints as unimportant or at least as less important than the fact that we should be grateful to have the opportunities we have here at Princeton. Princeton is great — we worked really hard to get in — and we work harder still to succeed here. To feel out of place is to have failed; to look insecure is to look weak. When we do bring ourselves to acknowledge that we feel lonely, anxious, insecure, depressed or just incredibly down, it seems like no one is there to listen. Sometimes, this is the case; a friend you reach out to is too bogged down in her own work and commitments to offer much support or comfort. She takes a minute to shoot you a short, “Aw, it’ll get better! I’m here for you!” and quickly turns back to whatever task is at hand. We are reminded yet again that our peers are busy achieving the great and worthwhile. We decide we should stop pestering others with our problems — that we should be using that time to also be achieving the great and worthwhile. However, it may just be that our peers aren’t sure what the best response is or how they can help because they themselves are struggling with the same problems. We tell our friends that it’ll get better because we ourselves are hoping that it’s true. It is sometimes just as scary for the friend being reached out to as it is for the one reaching out to discuss insecurities and struggles because we are so accustomed to keeping our issues to ourselves. Many of the events sponsored by the Princeton Mental Health Initiative during Mental Health Week are centered on the self — how to share your thoughts, overcome your inner critic, be mindful, sleep better, reduce stress. Granted, a fundamental part of mental wellness is being able to monitor and take care of oneself. However, before we can seek to change individuals, we must work toward fostering an environment and community that is conducive for individual mental well-being. Mental Health Week should provide more opportunities for honest and heartfelt dialogue among students. Brave students who volunteer to share their stories and struggles will have an infinitely greater impact on changing the mindset of students than professionals or representatives of services offered by the school. I would also suggest Mental Health Week include a workshop for the leaders of student-run organizations and groups on campus that would teach them how to foster support systems. Personally, some of the people I feel closest to and most supported by are the people on my dance team. Though our official purpose is to perform and compete, unofficially we are a tight-knit group of friends. If we encourage all student groups on campus to adopt a similar spirit of camaraderie and teach them how to create open and inclusive spaces, then I think we would find that more students feel that they have a place here at Princeton — that there are people they can rely on for support. Mental Health Week focuses a great deal on self-improvement, but we should remember that mental health issues aren’t something we have to face alone. To forget this would be unfair to ourselves and to the people we choose to surround ourselves with. It may seem like people have tough skin or have more important things to do, but that barrier is only skin deep. Everyone has insecurities, and we shouldn’t feel compelled to go about our lives pretending that we don’t.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan. She can be reached at ljkim@princeton.edu. 
58436|~|Say my name, say my name|~|   March 4 2014|~|Column | Mar. 4 |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|In the seventh grade, my communications teacher pronounced my name “Chutney.” Even with eight years’ retrospect, I don’t think he was being racist; I just think that he saw my name on the roster, the thick conglomeration of consonants up front and all 13 letters of my undulating surname, and froze up. My seventh grade communications teacher was a strange man. As we sat in silence and read every day during class, he would scrutinize a dictionary. Often, he’d be crying by the end of the hour. Moved to tears by the power of words, I think. By October, he’d stopped calling me Chutney. I can only assume he finally came upon it in the dictionary. Starbucks employees, so infamous for mishearing names that I’m pretty seriously convinced that they do it on purpose, has never once gotten my name right. I’ve gone through so many variations of names that sound like Shruthi — Yumi, Trudy, Shroomy — and even more that sound nothing like Shruthi — Tracey, Teresa, Chelsea — that I could easily compile an extensive Buzzfeed article called “32 Times Corporate Coffee Has Almost Given Me An Identity Crisis.” In high school, every time a new teacher would call attendance, there would be a long pause right after DeCandia, Trisha. I knew it was a long pause dedicated to unraveling my name, so I would affirm that I was there and offer an easy tutorial (“It’s like Ruthie, with a Sh”), though I knew full well the teacher in question would pointedly avoid calling on me for at least two weeks. Since I’ve come to college, I’ve grown to dread introducing myself. It always goes the same way: I say my name, I say it again as my roommates chuckle at the progression of the hallowed ritual, I say it a little slower, and finally the person I’m talking to either settles on their mispronunciation of choice (“Wait, you said Shaq, right?”) or awkwardly doesn’t address me for the rest of the day. This whole process is infinitely more painful if it’s occurring on a Thursday or Saturday night. Worst of all, however, are the people who ask me if they can call me something else entirely. Something easier to say, something more western. Susie, maybe. Maybe Samantha? It happened a lot when I was younger, when I was selling Girl Scout cookies to a well-meaning soccer mom or giving my name for a restaurant reservation. For years I thought nothing of it — of course, call me whatever you want! Whatever’s easiest for you!   It took me a while to realize the difference between nicknames — which I love — and thorough rebranding. It’s completely disrespectful. It’s the equivalent of sitting someone down and saying: “look, I know it’ll probably take me 30 seconds to learn how to say your name, but I really just can’t be bothered.”  My name is fairly phonetic and pretty easy to pronounce if you try, but regardless of how complicated the name — however many consecutive vowels or fancy diacritical marks — making the effort to get someone’s name right should be a basic form of common courtesy. Difficult names tend to be ethnic, and botching a name steeped in culture and history can be offensive on an entirely different level. And asking to call that person something else strips her of her identity altogether. The media got into a lot of trouble for this at last year’s Oscars. Reporters flocked to Quvenzhané Wallis, the 10-year-old actress who was nominated for an Academy Award for her work in “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” However, instead of taking the time (all of three minutes, probably) to learn her name, as their jobs would require them to do, they asked her if they could call her “Little Q” or “Annie.” It’s understandable to be daunted by a name with 10 letters, a Q and an accent, and even more understandable to ask her to pronounce it for them so they can get a better hang of it, but to not even bother is rude. The thing is, glossing over ethnic names has become so commonplace in society that the reporters didn’t seem to think twice about it. If something is too foreign-sounding, change it. Whitewashing is a vast topic on its own, but nine times out of 10, that’s where the problem with renaming finds root. Names are so important, which is why people change names they don’t like and spend so much time thinking of what names they’ll give their kids. If it’ll take 30 seconds more to pay attention and get a name right, there’s no reason not to.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

58373|~|Editorial: Transparency regarding mental health forced withdrawals|~|   March 4 2014|~|Editorial | March 4 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|In February, The Daily Princetonian reported on a lawsuit filed by a student who was allegedly asked to withdraw from the University following a suicide attempt in 2012. Based on the complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, the ‘Prince’ reported, “Just as the student was leaving the hospital following the suicide attempt, he was informed that the University had evicted him from his dorm room, that he was prohibited from his classes and that he was banned from all areas of campus.” This story, along with recently published allegations of similar occurrences at Yale, has raised concerns among students that individuals experiencing mental health issues could be forced to withdraw from the University. In light of these allegations and the way concerns about forced withdrawal could prevent individuals with mental health issues from seeking treatment, the Editorial Board believes the University should make public and transparent the conditions under which it requires students with mental health issues to leave campus. In the cited article from the ‘Prince,’ University Spokesperson Martin Mbugua commented, “There is no specific process automatically implemented, because each case is handled individually.” Even if there is no single automatic process, without further comment from the University regarding the conditions under which students might be asked to leave, there is no transparency that might allow for rational debate and criticism of the way the University handles such cases. We, the student body, do not know when a student suffering from mental health issues might be forced to leave campus against his or her will. We do not know how the University weighs concerns like legal liability, the best interests of the student or, more controversially, its national reputation in deciding when to require withdrawal. Therefore, stories like those reported at Princeton and Yale raise a legitimate concern on the part of students with mental health issues that they may be forced to leave the University. Uncertainty, combined with a fear of being forced to leave campus engendered by the various accounts that have come to light, may cause students with mental health issues to hesitate or refrain from seeking help, even if that fear is ultimately unjustified. A student who has experienced suicidal thoughts may, in light of recent stories about the treatment of individuals who have attempted suicide, be more inclined to conceal that fact from University doctors or avoid seeking help at all. Thus, the University’s lack of transparency makes it more likely that students with mental health issues will not seek out or receive the treatment they need. Mental health issues already face an unfortunate social stigma, which may deter individuals from getting help. Princeton’s ongoing Mental Health Week attempts to improve this situation, but the University’s lack of transparency regarding forced mental health withdrawals exacerbates the problem. The Board would like to believe that the University and Counseling and Psychological Services generally act in the best interests of students facing mental health issues and that students are forced to withdraw only in the most dire circumstances. However, we cannot say whether this is the case without further public comment elaborating the way these cases are handled. In the interest of transparency and the well-being of students who may experience mental health issues but are deterred from seeking effective treatment by fear and uncertainty about University policy, the Board calls upon the University to make a public statement detailing, with as much specificity and clarity as possible, the conditions under which students with mental health issues may be forced to withdraw.|~|
58380|~|Midterms month|~|   March 4 2014|~|Column | March 4 |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|As spring break draws ever closer, many students on campus are increasingly filled with a sense of dread, an overbearing feeling of anxiety, for midterms week is fast approaching. Yet, for many students, midterms week is already here. And for others, midterms week won’t take place until after spring break. Even though the Princeton academic calendar designates the week of March 10-14 as “midterms week,” many professors opt to give midterms the week before or the week following the break, rather than during midterms week itself. Their rationale is perfectly legitimate — some professors want to break up a single midterm exam into two tests, one on either side of spring break, which serves to lessen the weight that a single midterm exam can have on a student’s overall final grade. According to economics professor Ulrich Mueller, who teaches ECO 202: Statistics and Data Analysis for Economics, “More exams average out randomness, giving me a better sense of students’ abilities. And I also think that some students underestimate the material, so the first midterm sometimes serves as a useful wake-up call.” For other professors, midterms week simply does not occur at a convenient time, and it simply makes more sense to break up the content of some classes in ways besides an even 50-50 split (half before midterms week, half after). However, delineating course matter into logical sections (for instance, 60-40) may not necessarily result in a class schedule that conforms to the dates established by midterms week. There are also midterm projects to consider — a project is significantly different from an exam in that it requires greater time outside of class to complete, and to make it due during midterms week would mean that it would have to be assigned much further in advance. Instead, classes with projects often assign such assignments right around midterms week and make them due within a week or so afterward, providing students with sufficient time to apply all the material they learned during the past six weeks to the project itself. With all these considerations, the demarcation of a specific midterms week, though well-intentioned, is ultimately a poorly designed policy. For starters, in order to be maximally effective, every single class on campus would have to adhere to the same test-scheduling procedures, but instead, situations arise in which some classes host midterms during that week while others do not. In the end, the fact that many courses deviate from the pattern renders midterms week effectively meaningless. As it stands, the month of March might as well be labeled “midterms month.” However, there is no way to verify how many classes actually administer tests during midterms week and how many don’t, because there is no codified calendar of midterm exam dates, which may be the start of the problem. Unlike with the finals week schedule (which the Office of the Registrar has already released for the spring 2014 semester), midterm exam dates are not universally compiled, and it is largely up to individual professors of each class to tell students when and where a midterm will be taking place. This would be a good place to begin in working to clear midterms week of some of its stress and uncertainty. The administration should encourage professors to notify the Registrar early in the semester when and where the midterm(s) for their courses will be held and then allow the Registrar’s office to provide this information to students equally early on, as is currently done with the final exams schedule. If it should be the case that enough exams are being given outside of the five days that comprise the official “midterms week,” then the school might want to consider doing away with “midterms week” altogether. Rather than designate a specific frame of five days for classes to hold exams, it would be preferable to instead allow each professor to decide a test schedule for his or her individual course, a schedule that is unique to the pace and the needs of that class’s specific curriculum. In all likelihood, many professors will continue to give midterm exams during the sixth week of the semester anyways. But for other classes, it will provide some freedom, liberating them from the perception that midterms must be given during midterms week. Though it’s too late to change the policies governing this coming midterms week, gradual modifications will allow the process of midterm examinations to become much more straightforward and, hopefully, a less stressful experience.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

To put it into perspective, WhatsApp is now worth 10 percent more than Sony’s market cap and more than Southwest Airlines or Marriott International. For $19 billion dollars, each WhatsApp user is worth $42, even though the app is free and only generated revenues of around $20 million last year, a hundredth of Facebook paid to acquire it. But the acquisition of WhatsApp is just the latest in a series of deals by big tech companies, including Yahoo!’s acquisition of Tumblr, and Facebook’s Instagram purchase. Although the other deals were valued around $1 billion, a much cheaper price than WhatsApp, they all represent a precarious trend that these Internet tech companies have to maintain high growth just to survive. All of these deals are not purchases of products, but purchases of customers. Since these companies rely on an advertising model to monetize, they constantly need fresh users to replenish their audience for ads. They also need to battle every flash-in-the-pan app that starts gaining users quickly, because those startups could be taking customers. Unlike other companies mentioned, such as Southwest Airlines or Sony, Internet companies have extraordinarily low barriers to entry, sometimes requiring just a college kid with a laptop and a dream. This means that every small startup could be a competitor. While product companies sit comfortably on their large market shares, companies like Facebook have to be constantly vigilant. These big Internet companies fill this need for users and stave off the competition by periodic acquisitions. In essence, Facebook saw purchasing WhatsApp as a way to simply survive. Unfortunately, the costs of these acquisitions show that this strategy is unsustainable in the long term. WhatsApp’s acquisition is more than just a pricey Facebook buy, it may also signal that Silicon Valley is in a tech bubble that is bound to pop. Advertising is a fickle monetary strategy, relying on users to keep using the product at all times. Although product sales can rely on repeat buys (think household products, which also have more brand loyalty), people are less inclined to switch haphazardly from one brand to another, while any small dissatisfactions can uproot teenage social media users to seek another platform. If the only revenue stream for a company is in advertising, that is a problem. The companies that survive are the ones that will diversify from that revenue model. Google, for example, does a great job of doing this. Even though the lion’s share of their current revenue comes from advertisements, other areas of their revenue are also growing, namely in the Google Play store and in their hardware developments. Google has expanded its business from a simple search engine and Internet services like email to include increasingly popular Chromebooks, the Google Play store (now the biggest app store) and other projects like Google Glass. It has also acquired a series of robotics companies like Nest Labs, maker of automated home thermostats, Boston Dynamics, maker of robots for military uses, and SCHAFT Inc., creator of disaster-relief robots. This expansion into hardware shows a diversification strategy into areas of tech that benefit people in concrete ways and doesn’t rely on teenagers’ clicks. Many of these companies are the ones heavily recruiting Princeton graduates, building strong reputations with heavy campus involvement and hard interview processes, but a good reputation doesn’t always translate to longevity. Students have to recognize that glamour and publicity don’t mean success, but instead are something to watch out for in the future, especially in the tech field.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

58249|~|A model of constructive discussion|~|   March 3 2014|~|Column | March 3 |~|Katherine Zhao|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Last weekend, I took a break from the Orange Bubble and went to the East Coast Asian American Student Union conference, which was held at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. ECAASU is a nonprofit whose mission is to “inspire, educate and empower those interested in Asian-American and Pacific Islander issues.” Every year for the past 36 years, ECAASU has had an annual conference dedicated to bringing together Asian-American college students to discuss issues that are relevant to us in a series of workshops, as well as to create a forum for Asian-American students to share and discuss their experiences. On Friday afternoon, some Princeton students and I squeezed into two rented vans and made the four-hour drive down to D.C. The conference effectively brought together students from different schools with different experiences to discuss relevant Asian-American issues, spreading ideas and inspiring each other. The topics that were brought up for discussion were also topics that are usually brushed over, ideas that go through our heads at some point but are too big to bring up and talk about during our stressful daily lives at Princeton. The workshops introduced topics such as self-identity, Asian-American feminism and leadership. The first workshop I went to, “How Far Have We Come?” addressed the presence of Asian-American studies departments at various universities. This workshop consisted of a panel of students from different universities who were all involved in either pushing for an Asian-American studies program at their respective universities, or were a student in the Asian-American studies program that already existed at their school. Evan Kratzer ’16, current copresident of the Asian-American Student Association at Princeton, was a panelist in this workshop as one of AASA’s main missions is to create such a program at Princeton. Princeton currently has no Asian-American studies program studies within the American Studies program, and the creation of the program is in the preliminary stages of planning. At a conference like this, ideas are spread when student leaders get together and share their experiences about creating Asian-American studies programs at their schools, and because the development of Princeton’s own Asian-American studies program is currently in the works, such discussion is especially constructive. At Princeton, it’s hard to discuss big topics like these in everyday conversation, especially when the student body is so diverse and has so many different interests. A conference like ECAASU is effective and productive because it brings together people who share similar goals and thoughts in a setting to discuss important political issues that are often under-discussed. The second workshop that I went to was called “#notyourasiansidekick,” and the speaker was an Asian-American feminist. We talked about stereotypes of Asian-Americans in the media: Asian-American women are portrayed as either the Dragon Lady or the delicate china doll, and Asian-American men are similarly portrayed as either the martial artist or the nerd. These binaries that are so prevalent in the media in turn create images of us that the public holds, and these stereotypes prevent us from achieving individuality. We talked about issues like misrepresentation and underrepresentation of Asian-Americans in the media; the appearances of Asian-Americans in Hollywood are often limited to small roles of foreigners, requiring them to speak foreign languages when in fact, the actors and actresses are born and raised in America and speak perfect English. In other places, discussions like these are rarely held because they are only relevant to the Asian-American community. Being able to hear the thoughts of Asian-American women from different areas of the East Coast was especially enlightening. This highlights the importance of gaining new perspectives from as many angles as possible, something we rarely give a second thought to. The conference was especially effective in that it brought together Asian-American students from up and down the East Coast, and it created a space to discuss specific Asian-American issues. By both bringing a number of diverse perspectives together and creating a concentrated forum for discussion of specific issues, the ECAASU conference provided a unique opportunity for what might be the most effective type of discourse possible. In the future, student organizations at Princeton should strive to promote this sort of discourse on any and all important issues.|~|Katherine Zhao is a freshman from East Brunswick, N.J.

58152|~|“What’s wrong with you?”|~|   March 3 2014|~|Column | March 3 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Just one of the many texts and missed calls I received when I woke up last fall after my friend, as a light-hearted prank, had changed my Facebook status to “Leaving for the semester, can’t wait to see you guys next year!” While I quickly resolved the confusion, informing my very worried mother and my less concerned friends that I was in fact not leaving for the next semester (probably to the dismay of my more vocal and critical readers), the response from those close to me left a lasting impression. Instead of being a potential for alternative growth or creativity, the idea of leaving was considered a rash judgment. To them, my announcement was not just simply a change in location but conjured up words such as “giving up,” “failure” and “wasted potential.”  The initial treatment I received were questions over what went wrong, as if the mere idea of leaving in and of itself were irrational. And who can blame them? Respected role models like former President Bill Clinton, saying the “main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit,” or businessman Ted Turner, suggesting that winners never quit, leaves a long-lasting impression. To leave is to give up — a public admittance of defeat. This is especially true at Princeton, where our obsession with achieving success, getting good grades and obtaining internships consumes many of our peers. College is not just a place for intellectual enhancement on an individual level but also an opportunity to improve oneself relatively before pitting ourselves against each other in a limited and sluggish job market. We acknowledge the competition and place the benchmark of four years in our head as the norm, seeing any deviation from that as a sign of something gone awry and the beginning of the path towards failure. Princeton is especially strong in promoting the four-year course. From its strict policy of not admitting transfer students to its residential college system, Princeton goes to great lengths to tie our identity to the four-year mentality. This differs from larger state universities, which are much more flexible with the time it takes to graduate, allowing for early graduation for some and offering five-year plans for others. And in the process we make ourselves conform to a pre-determined standard. Even though my Facebook status was simply over a simple break, a deviation from the norm, it was viewed as sacrilegious. While many acknowledge that academic stress can often be hard and for some even unbearable, the option of quitting as a legitimate choice seems to escape the minds of many. When news spreads that someone takes time off or even leaves entirely, questions arise over why the person would risk their degree. The assumption quickly forms around the idea that the decision may be rash or not fully thought out. We have failed to empathize, and in doing so, we have marginalized those who “quit.” Through collective dismissal, we have delegitimized what to many may be a reasonable or even preferable option. To leave Princeton for a semester to work or try something new almost never crosses the minds of our peers. We are programmed to follow the four-year course. In the process, we kill potential innovation. From the well-known dropouts, such as Harvard’s Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, to one of Princeton’s own dropouts, Seth Priebatsch, who would have been in the class of 2007 and now owns SCVNGR, a mobile game start up, many who have “quit” in the past have found success in unconventional ways. Yet when we repeatedly create this societal expectation that we need to finish college to be successful, we disincentivize those who may be able to better improve themselves outside the collegiate system. But what if that is not the case? Maybe it is time to redefine what quitting means. After all, some of the most successful leaders and innovators have quit in their past — either for the purposes of taking a break or to explore alternatives. For many, quitting is not equivalent to failure but rather an attempt to find one’s calling or to try something new. Now is a time for exploration and growth. Especially when the pressures of trying to pay rent and living day-to-day are much less of a concern, it is better than ever to experiment and take risks. Maybe this concept of quitting as inherently negative is an endemic part of our culture that we may never be able to remove. However, history has shown there are multiple paths to success. We should realize quitting may not always be the end, but can, for some, also be the beginning.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu.

57902|~|Social segmentation|~|   March 2 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|No one would argue that the Princeton social scene isn’t very centralized.  The majority of parties happen on the Street or in someone’s dorm as a pregame before some eating club event.  Because of the limited capacities of eating clubs, on most nights, you need be on a list in order to enter certain clubs. As an independent student, I have tried to scope out other options to have fun on campus. But unfortunately, I have found the same type of model being duplicated in other places as well. This system of excessive gatekeeping needs to end. Princeton is a relatively small campus in a quaint, central New Jersey town. Unlike Yale, Harvard or Columbia, there aren’t many options in town where upperclassmen can enjoy themselves. The result is that many students turn inward (i.e. the University) because there is no place else to look for entertainment. How many of your friends go into Manhattan or Philadelphia to go out? Not to mention that even though Rider and Rutgers are extremely close by, we have virtually no contact with them. This only lends more credence to us calling Princeton the Orange Bubble. The same sort of song-and-dance you go through with the eating clubs even happens at the residential colleges, of all places. There should be no reason why if Whitman College has a wine and cheese night, I have to have someone from Whitman to stand as my supervisor in order for me to enter the event. I’m 21 years old. Shouldn’t my ID be enough? The safeguards are younger than the attendants at times. I, and many other upperclassmen, just want to meet people we perhaps didn’t have the chance to meet the three or four years we’ve been here. It’s kind of like a last hurrah. If you are 21, you should be able to go to any wine and cheese night at any residential college that hosts one. These events are great alternatives to the Street but the system is still the same: because you technically do not belong there, someone else has to vouch for you. The same entrance restrictions apply to the D-Bar at the Graduate College as well. You need a graduate student to sign you in even if you are over 21 years of age. Undergraduates and graduate students already have a scant enough connection with one another as it is, limited mostly to preceptor-student exchanges and brief interactions while standing in line at Small World Coffee or Chancellor Green Café. Such additional barriers are unnecessary and harmful to the overall social cohesion at this school. It’s almost as if any effort you make to tap into another social space on campus ends in rejection. We are all Princeton students. Yes, we all have different interests and hobbies but we are all here for the same purpose: to learn not only from our studies but also from our peers. It is understandable to not allow underclassmen to certain events that have alcohol, but what about the upperclassmen, especially those who aren’t in eating clubs? The social options are scarce without having someone to endorse you. There should be more of an effort to allow students to roam around in diverse spaces in order to maximize their chances of meeting people with whom they can connect.|~|Morgan Jerkins is a comparative literature major from Williamstown, N.J.

57850|~|Editorial: Improve Young Alumni Trustee selection process|~|   March 2 2014|~|Editorial | March 2 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Since 1969, one senior from each year’s graduating class has been elected as a Young Alumni Trustee — a position conferring the same rights and responsibilities as a fully installed member of the University’s Board of Trustees. In that capacity, they sit on Board committees, aid in setting the University’s annual operating budget and contribute to the development of Princeton’s long-term strategic vision. Their role is an important one. As current undergraduates are largely removed from the affairs of University governance, the Young Alumni Trustees represent the Board’s principal means of engaging with the pragmatic realities of student life. Informed by an intimate and contemporaneous familiarity with the campus experience, they provide a critical and necessary source of advice. The majority of our peer schools offer no parallel initiatives, leaving their high-level governance to a board of trustees lacking insight into the unique needs and interests of undergraduate students. The Editorial Board commends the University for this institutionalized and substantive means of engaging Princeton’s youngest constituency in important decision making processes. What is problematic, however, is the set of policies prohibiting both issue-based and “organized” campaigning in the Young Alumni Trustee elections. Presently, election policy dictates that “trustees who arrive on the board having already staked out positions on issues without access to full information can undermine both the workings of the board and their own effectiveness.” As such, candidates are prohibited from running campaigns that focus on particular issues. While the Editorial Board is sensitive to this risk, it is also reminded of times when Young Alumni Trustees ran on platforms of especially pressing concern — for example, their positions concerning the controversial policy of University divestment from apartheid South Africa. Where such polarizing and significant matters exist, it is important that potential trustees can publicly declare their stance. Even without such salient examples, however, it is the position of this Board that issue-based campaigning will not necessarily compromise the integrity of a trustee’s participation in governance deliberations. We are convinced that the adoption of a particular campaign issue does not in any way inhibit a trustee’s ability to offer fair and sober considerations of Board matters during their tenure. Indeed, though Young Alumni Trustees do not represent constituencies, their very value to the Board lies in the consistency and representativeness of their beliefs vis-à-vis those of the undergraduate body. By permitting issue-based campaigning, the electorate will democratically and naturally select the candidate best suited to this role. The second element of the electoral restrictions prohibits “organized” campaigning, recognizing the rigors of senior year independent work. The Editorial Board, however, believes that a reasonable balance can be struck. By providing each candidate with a nominal budget to prepare and publicly disseminate a single statement (as has historically been the case), the University can allow the electorate to familiarize itself with the ballot without placing undue additional stress on the candidates. Such a policy would maintain the level playing field of these elections, while also furnishing voters with a more robust means of evaluating potential trustees. Reconsidering both of these present restrictions on campaigning will permit an election process that is more open, better-informed and ultimately, most conducive to electing the best qualified candidates.|~|
57907|~|Letter to the Editor: March 2, 2014|~|   March 2 2014|~|Letter to the Editor | March 2 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|In its Feb. 25 editorial “Enhance Tiger Tuesdays,” The Daily Princetonian writes that the Office of Admission’s Tiger Tuesday program does not effectively sell the University to early admitted students. The editorial suggests that the program should present more opportunities for interaction between admitted students and undergraduates, and that the roster of events generally should be expanded. We agree that providing interaction between admitted students and undergraduates is a worthy goal, and we believe that Tiger Tuesday does indeed provide plenty of these opportunities. The events and activities outlined in the editorial, however, would effectively create a second Princeton Preview, which was never the intention of the admission office. Rather, Tiger Tuesday was implemented to give early admitted students the opportunity for a quick visit, to visit a class, to keep them focused on Princeton as they consider their admission options and, most importantly, to whet their appetite for Princeton Preview, not to present a substitute for it. A little history and a description of the program are perhaps in order. The Office of Admission implemented the February Tiger Tuesday program in 2012, the academic year we reinstated early action, so admitted students who wished to visit campus before the April Princeton Preview events would have the chance to do so. The program is a one-day event with opportunities for visiting students to go to class, have lunch with an undergraduate, mingle with other undergraduates, explore campus, chat with professors and meet their potential classmates. Students are invited to bring their parents or guardians. This year, as in past years, admitted students had many options to engage with University students. More than 50 undergraduate volunteers, most of whom were previous Princeton Preview hosts, conversed with the admitted students over breakfast and throughout the morning. These students, as well as our student bloggers, were invited to take an admitted student to lunch in one of the residential colleges or the Center for Jewish Life. We offered tours of the library, museum and campus, among other activities. Students interested in the BSE program toured the Engineering Quadrangle and went to classes. In the afternoon, we held a reception for students and families with many campus representatives, including ROTC, the LGBT Center and USG leadership.  In addition, we encouraged all admitted students to enrich their interactions by participating in the admitted student website and our new admission blog, “Speaking of Princeton.” The program is not, as the editorial states, Northeast-biased. This year, almost 100 students and their families came from 16 states, including California, Georgia, Illinois and Texas, plus Ontario, Canada. In previous years, students came from as far away as Louisiana, Oregon and Wisconsin, as well as Japan, Korea and the U.K. And, if an early-admitted student indicates that he or she cannot attend Princeton Preview, and we designate that student for travel assistance, we will fly the student in for Tiger Tuesday at our expense. Given the demands of advanced placement courses, leadership and service of the admitted students in their senior year in high school, Tiger Tuesday gives students an introduction to Princeton, while being mindful of their busy schedules and respecting the high school curriculum.|~|Janet L.

57738|~|On controversial guest speakers |~|   February 27 2014|~|Column | Feb. 27 |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|On a gut level, international law and practice professor emeritus Richard Falk’s recent University-sanctioned lecture invitation was troubling. I disagree with him on his Middle Eastern policy views, and I even think his understanding of objective fact is misguided. Importantly, these tensions usually enhance my desire to be exposed to a person. I enjoy good debate. I enjoy good academic friction — that is, after all, how strong defensible opinions are formed. Perhaps I was upset that Falk was invited given his anti-Semitism, a separate, though related, sentiment to anti-Israelism. But why should that be a barrier to his speaking? He doesn’t need to like or respect Jewish people in order to have legitimate views. Many great thinkers were and are anti-Semitic, and I still care about their knowledge, wisdom and opinions. For a moment, I thought the University was in some way endorsing his views, but that is clearly not the case — Princeton doesn’t have “an opinion.” Rather, it facilitates discourse such that we, the University community, can form opinions. I reasoned that it could be the job of student organizations, not the University, to bring controversial speakers to campus, but why should that be the case? It took me a moment to understand that the University was not sanctioning Falk’s views, only his right to express them (and my right to hear them). I exhausted the reasons I might be opposed to this speech, and came to the conclusion that I am for it, and every such speech. This episode brought to mind the controversy surrounding Columbia’s bringing in Mahmud Ahmadinejad to speak back in 2007. Ahmadinejad, too, is an anti-Semite and an anti-gay figure as well. Equally important, he is a world leader. He and I don’t agree socially or politically, but that is no reason for me not to hear what he has to say as a global political figure, a powerful man, a shaper of policy. My knowledge and understanding of the world is greater for having heard (or read transcripts of) both Ahmadinejad and Falk. I don’t think anti-Semitism, or any specific ideology, should bar universities from hosting discussions with interesting thinkers. It is true one can argue the invitation of a prestigious institution gives these socially and morally subversive thinkers legitimacy, but I would argue that they are already legitimate. Falk was a professor at Princeton who held United Nations posts, and Ahmadinejad was the president of a country. Sure, they can return home with a reinforced sense of legitimacy, but I think that is worth giving students exposure to more of the world. Universities are not trying to incite controversy or give every opinion — no matter how marginal — a legitimate platform. They are just exposing students to new perspectives. These individuals are already accepted as some form of leader, they have power, and they have followings. How could a university ignore them? It is almost the duty of a university to introduce these types of people to its student body. While these figures do not necessarily raise the level of discourse, as bigoted opinions seldom do, they both introduce a diversity of opinion that is healthy for a student body to be aware of. It would obviously be ideal if these speeches were accompanied by a real-time fact-checking expert (to correct known falsehoods like Iran has no gays, the Palestinians suffer Nazism at the hands of Israelis, etc.), but they are not. Given the reality that these figures will speak unchecked, students should understand that their views are on the margin but important to understand. Ultimately, I would feel uncomfortable if the University were to rescind Falk’s invitation. As he was, he should have been allowed to speak, and students have should have heartily attended the lecture, as they did. This is how good conversation happens, this is how people reaffirm of their views (or not), and this is how people know that uncomfortable opinions exist. Opinions should be expressed, and I was wrong for thinking one should be barred because it does not specifically like my individual brand of personhood.  |~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif.

57736|~|Reforming small talk |~|   February 27 2014|~|Column | Feb. 27 |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|Humans are odd creatures. We’ve excelled as a species because of our ability to communicate and work together. We’ve ridden our social cohesion straight to the top of the food chain. And yet, despite such a masterful grasp of communication and social interaction, much of the time, we are surprisingly terrible at actually saying anything at all. Most people who know me will agree that I generally like to speak my mind. I don’t mean this in a confrontational sort of way. I simply mean that given the chance to have a conversation, I relish in the opportunity to honestly speak to someone, to say what’s on my mind, and to hear how other people think and feel. As a result, I often find that people are surprised by my sincerity. If someone asks how I am, I won’t hesitate to say if I’m having an awful day. This is in stark contrast to the automated answering machines that we put on in our day-to-day conversations, the mind-numbingly repetitive and utterly superficial ritual that is small talk. The first week on campus freshman year, you inevitably learn more names than you could ever hope to remember. Each name comes with a five-minute halfhearted attempt at conversation, each question followed by a completely trivial answer. How are your classes? Good. How’s your room?  Nice. As a result, almost instantaneously, your brain throws away the information and the name that goes with it. Why save space for it? You never actually learned anything important, just heard the standard list of courtesies and handed back the list of your own. In some sense, especially in situations like this, small talk is a necessary evil. With so many people and so much information, nobody can remember it all, so saying anything worthwhile is futile. Unfortunately, this ritual of simultaneously saying something and nothing at the same time doesn’t go away. We grow accustomed to it and use it in place of conversation that could really mean something. And what is the result of our concerted effort to hide how we’re truly feeling?  It’s exactly that. Each of us walks away from a conversation with completely inaccurate information about each other. Why is it such a problem that so many people do not feel adequate enough to be here?  It’s because nobody ever says how they truly feel. This idea has been noted before, that students here feel the need to pretend they are perfectly fine. But I think it goes deeper than our competitive natures. How can we really come to understand anyone else if we are too busy commenting on the weather or remarking how far Forbes College is from everything else? OK, maybe I’m being a bit unrealistic with my expectations. Small talk does have its use for some people. After a long day, a tough test and tons of homework, it’s understandable to not want to commit yourself to a serious conversation. But personally, I find small talk exhausting and not particularly useful. Don’t feel obligated to say something, especially just for the sake of saying something. Going through the motions of superficially responding to questions just feels pointless. I’d much rather hear what you really think. What better way to unwind?  You don’t need to argue with me about geopolitical feuds in the Middle East to have a meaningful conversation. In many ways it’s considered rude or taboo to say what’s on your mind, especially to strangers. Please. Don’t let the fact that we have no prior social interaction be a barrier to being honest about your thoughts or feelings. In fact, there is so much more to say considering how little we know about each other. Why waste time talking about the trivial when we have so much to learn? If you don’t feel like talking at the moment, then don’t. I won’t be offended. But hey, as long as we’re talking, why don’t you tell me what’s really on your mind?  |~|Christian Wawrzonek is a sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pa. He can be reached at cjw5@princeton.edu. 
57688|~|What's in a name?|~|   February 27 2014|~|Column | Feb. 27 |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|Despite the stereotype afforded to English majors, I am not terrible at math. I cannot say I enjoy the subject nor that its more complicated aspects come naturally, but I am certainly capable of basic understanding and usage. I am, though, afraid of math — at least as it is defined within the Princeton community. The fast-paced, competitive nature of math courses, many of which are requirements for engineers and others with quantitative leanings, paired with the tyrannical hand of grade deflation has deterred me from taking these courses. Nonetheless, this semester proved the best time to take my quantitative reasoning distribution requirement and thus explains my current enrollment in the poorly named Math Alive. Taking the class should have been a fairly easy decision, seeing as it fit into my schedule and the course description seemed on par with my academic goals. The class focuses more on the application and explanation of mathematical functions within society rather than on complex equations, which is well-suited to humanities majors looking for an approachable engagement with Princeton mathematics. There was only one true deterrent — the course title. Math Alive sounds more like an educational children’s song about numbers than it does a legitimate Princeton lecture despite the fact that it truly is an interesting and insightful course taught by a fantastic professor. A potential employer looking at my transcript sees only that title — not the course description — and therein lies my concern. The legitimacy of the course, and furthermore the work involved, is undermined by its witty title. Math Alive could just as simply be called Practical Mathematics — an alternative noted by the professor himself — and, were this the case, I would feel my work was being more fairly and justly represented. My desire is by no means to obscure the relative ease of this class when compared to others in this field. I understand that a class such as Math Alive cannot be, and should not be, named so as to be on par with MAT 330: Complex Analysis with Applications or anything of the like. But the course title should fairly and seriously reflect the subject, keeping in mind the larger context in which it is being offered. I would prefer it not appear I took the class because there was a catchy title when really it is the subject matter that is most interesting to me as a largely qualitative thinker. Fortunately, I found myself with fewer examples of this issue when scouring past course offerings than I expected. But there are certainly a couple each semester that undermine their own legitimacy in the same fashion. I cannot help but point to fall 2012’s FRS 177: Bad A$$ Asians: Crime, Vice, and Morality in East Asia as a title I would prefer not to have on my own transcript, particularly if I were applying to formal jobs within Asia. And even I was skeptical of FRS 165: Work, as the name suggests a study hall more than as it does a literary exploration into the changing nature of the job market. From a professor’s point of view, though, these titles do serve a purpose. Jeff Nunokawa, English professor and master of Rockefeller College, admits that choosing the title of a course is an “effort to be faithful to the content” but also “a little bit of public relations.” A casual reader is certainly more likely to read the description of a course titled “Bad A$$ Asians” than he is “Crime, Vice, and Morality in East Asia” on its own. However, professors must recognize the implications of such titles as students continue to graduate into a saturated and limited job market, particularly for humanities majors. Each line of the transcript bears an unprecedented weight and those riddled with what appear to be, but truthfully are not, “joke” courses could very well be a detriment to success. Nonetheless, as students nationwide move away from the humanities, I do worry that there will be an increasing tendency towards these creative names — professors attempting to combat this shift by titling their courses with clever puns and pop culture references that unfairly suggest the “all fun” nature of classes targeted to humanities students. However, it should not be the mistakenly perceived ease of these courses that attracts students but rather the challenge of creative and analytical thinking. Thus, honest and informative course titles, without gimmicks or pandering, will continue to attract the type of dedicated students both professors and employers should want while ensuring that students who do explore other fields at introductory levels are not penalized for stepping outside their fields of expertise.|~|Chelsea Jones is an English major from Ridgefield, Conn.

57493|~|In the service of the nation's students|~|   February 26 2014|~|Column | Feb. 26 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|This column is the first in a series about socioeconomic diversity and low-income students at the University. While we were holed up in dorms and libraries studying for finals, University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 was out and about, visiting the home of Princeton alumna, one Michelle Obama ’85. I can’t feel too bitter about him running around in Washington, D.C., though, since he was acting in the educational interests of students at Princeton and elsewhere. Eisgruber was attending a summit on college opportunities for low-income students, where he floated important initiatives to improve access to Princeton education for lower-income students. Such initiatives are key to national economic mobility, but do not go far enough in ensuring that excellent education is available to all students, regardless of income. Incremental initiatives The summit was capped by the First Lady speaking about the opportunities her time at Princeton had afforded her. As Mrs. Obama said, education at a school like Princeton has a powerful effect on low-income students, due not only to the quality of education at such a school but also to the connections with other thinkers, movers and shakers that students make during our time here. The Ivy League schools, and their admissions offices especially, are thus gatekeepers to economic and professional success. Princeton especially, with the largest per-student endowment of the Ivies, has the resources to make a marked difference in the lives of students. The policies the University and its peers take toward recruiting, preparing and educating low-income students, then, have the potential to shape the socioeconomic realities of American life as much as any government policy. University policy can be more farsighted than government policy too. In contrast to the simplest and largest government measures to reduce inequality — progressive taxation and entitlements targeting basic necessities, such as food and medical care — access to elite education ensures that all students are given the opportunity to educate themselves. On the individual level, a student who obtains an elite education is less likely to need these entitlement programs, but the benefits go beyond the student; a Princeton-educated student is a citizen who can contribute more — economically and intellectually — to society than otherwise. At the White House summit, President Eisgruber released a statement outlining new commitments to expanding opportunity for low-income students. This included three laudable initiatives — developing a STEM module to the Freshman Scholars Institute, expanding Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America and continuing efforts to recruit low-income students. FSI is a valuable resource, preparing dozens of students for Princeton’s classes during the summer before freshman year, and adding an option for students interested in STEM careers will benefit these students — and, by extension, their future innovations, colleagues and fields. LEDA’s goal to bring students to Princeton to draw them to a selective education is creditable and dovetails with current efforts to encourage these students to apply by working with their counselors and waiving their application fees. But these incremental initiatives are not enough. Failing the litmus test The lowest income used by Princeton admissions and financial aid offices — a bracket which includes as low as 15.8 percent of Princeton students — is a household income of less than $60,000 annually. As a measure for information on the University’s generous financial aid program, this is sensible — most students below this cutoff are granted full tuition, room and board, while fewer students above it are. But this is not a sensible definition of low-income in measuring economic diversity. In 2012, the annual median income for U.S. families was $51,371. This means the lowest-earning half of American families contributes as little as 15.8 percent of Princeton students. Meanwhile, in 2012 around one third of Princeton students responding to the Committee on Background and Opportunity III report reported their household incomes to be $200,000 or greater, representing a mere 3.8 percent of American households in the 2010 Census. Lower and middle-income students are woefully underrepresented at elite institutions, particularly Princeton. U.S. News and World Report measures economic diversity of a campus by the proportion of students who are Pell Grant recipients, and Princeton measures at 12 percent – the third lowest among top-25-ranked colleges. Though Princeton has become more diverse since the 1950s, when Jewish and Asian students were rarities and all students were male, it is still severely lacking in meaningful economic diversity. In the face of these disparities, the University’s incremental efforts to improve economic diversity are nearly trivial. What we need is another paradigm shift the size of our groundbreaking no-loan financial aid program, which began for the Class of 2002. Since 2003, in the wake of this program, the University has increased its enrollment of Pell Grant students by 50 percent. Unfortunately, since then, the University’s priorities have not been on increasing access to a wide range of low-income students. In its report last September, the Trustee Ad Hoc Committee on Diversity failed to include any discussion of Princeton’s current, historical or desired economic diversity in its report, focusing instead on race and gender. This despite recognizing that “Princeton and its peers do not come close to looking like America today” and maintaining that “[i]f equality of opportunity is the bedrock on which the United States was built, diversity is the litmus test of whether this equality is being truly achieved.” The University’s ultimate goal, then, should be to have student income distribution mirror that of our nation as a whole. Of course, Princeton cannot achieve this goal alone; by the time students even begin applying for college, there is already a dismaying achievement gap along economic lines. Because of this, until we as a nation realize groundbreaking changes in primary and secondary education, Princeton will likely only be able to approach an equitable and representative income distribution. But this does not mean we cannot make significant strides. The higher proportion of students receiving Pell grants at our peer institutions such as Columbia (30 percent), Harvard (20 percent) and MIT (20 percent) indicates that there is no lack of talented and deserving students among this demographic. In order to reach this demographic makeup, though, the Office of Admission must be proactive throughout the admissions process, not only encouraging these students to apply but also making it more likely that they get in. Affirmative Action Yes, I’m advocating for affirmative action. The Office of Admission should set and actively work towards a target proportion of low-income admits. Like the 35 percent which defines grade deflation, this need not be a strict quota, but should weigh heavily in admissions decisions, individually and as a group. Last year’s affirmative action case “Fisher v. University of Texas” illustrates in a number of ways the need for this sort of affirmative action. Consider first, rather than the arguments in the case or the plaintiff and defendant, one of the arbiters, one of three Princeton alumni on the Supreme Court. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor ’76 has made it well known that affirmative action likely played a part in her admission to Princeton and is unapologetic — with good reason. On campus, Sotomayor struggled to adapt to Princeton’s rigors but soon became a campus leader in Latino issues, often consulted directly by then-President Bowen GS ’58. As a result of her efforts, the University expanded not only its Latino student population, but also committed to hiring Puerto Rican and Latino professors and administrators, and started running a seminar on Puerto Rican political history. Princeton benefited from Sotomayor’s presence at the same time that she benefited from its educational offerings. Princeton, thanks to the efforts of Sotomayor and those like her, is now more diverse and more welcoming to diversity — and the University understands the importance of race-based affirmative action in this diversity. When “Fisher v. University of Texas” reached the Supreme Court last year, Princeton joined many of its peer institutions in filing an amicus brief, arguing that race-based affirmative action was still a useful tool in building diversity in the student body. But race-based affirmative action is no longer on its own sufficient for ensuring holistic diversity within the student body. Although unfortunately race and income are still correlated in this country, many racial minorities have a significant number of successful members. As a result, strictly racial affirmative action does not target all the students it should, and some who have no need for the leg up it provides. Taken as a part of a holistic admissions policy, though, it still has a place, especially if the admissions office uses it and information gleaned from students’ personal stories to reach other underrepresented demographics — namely, the bottom half, by income, of Americans. Yes, the University currently has a holistic admissions process, and yes, lower-income students who have overcome long odds or have compelling perspectives are already considered stronger applicants. But in light of lackluster lower-income enrollment, Princeton must make public its target enrollment numbers, and take good faith measures in making admissions decisions to reach those numbers. If currently, a little over 15 percent of Princeton students come from the lower half of American income, it should not be too much to aim for a third of all those enrolled coming from this income bracket. We may fall short, but we can make great strides nonetheless. Paying it Forward Here, a fair question arises: How can Princeton expect to double the enrollment of students in the bracket which gets a full grant? In light of this year’s gross tuition increase, it would be unfair to place the burden squarely on the shoulders of those who can afford to pay every cent of their way through. Some of the money could, perhaps, be made up of alumni donations galvanized by Princeton’s newfound commitment to education for Americans from all classes. Fortunately, a model for expansive free education is already being advanced in the Oregon public university system. Under the Oregon “Pay it Forward” plan, whose planning the state legislature approved last summer, students would pay no tuition whatsoever, instead dedicating a small percentage of all future income to the state university system. If the University were to give students who could not otherwise afford it the option to enter a program similar to this one, full tuition and fees need not be covered by grants — they can be covered in the future by the students themselves. Thus Princeton would literally make an investment by educating its students, and allow more lower-income students admission while staying on the forefront of financial aid. Such a program would clearly be more complicated than I can put forward right now, but it is important to understand that money should not be a problem to a creative financial aid office. Leading the way from here The best part of publicly aiming to admit more lower-income students? Princeton will be seen as an accessible option for the highest achievers who might not otherwise have given the Ivy League — bastion of wealth that it is — a second thought. When more talented students apply, the expanded room for such students fills itself. And if one school succeeds, other schools will follow. With enough effort, elite intuitions need no longer be elitist institutions, and can instead be ladders by which the Sonia Sotomayor’s and Michelle Obama’s of the future — driven students of all colors, genders, and identities – can enter the ranks of our leaders. Thus, Princeton acting in the service of students allows the University to act in the service of this nation and all nations, while individual students are each given the opportunity they deserve to succeed.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a sophomore from Littleton, Colo.

57318|~|Make independent work optional|~|   February 25 2014|~|Column | Feb. 25 |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|The Princeton University Library system holds almost 60,000 theses, written by senior students from 1926 to 2013. But, other than living trapped in Mudd Library, where do these theses ever really go? Your words or calculations will represent a space of the world that has previously gone unexplored. Your thesis will entail collaboration with sleepless nights, extraordinary professors  and, most likely, a great deal of funding. But the bulky senior thesis, with its unnerving deadlines and demands, might not be the best way to get the most out of our education or prepare us for our future careers, whether we find ourselves thrust into the workforce or tethered to another academic institution. For some students, the senior thesis represents a long-term research project that produces a piece of scholarly work that can be presented to future employers, equipping students with a supplement to the curriculum vitae, honors, recommendation letters and transcript. Through the thesis-writing process, students find themselves knee-deep in records, libraries and advanced research, in close contact with professors and experts of the field, and in service of whatever academic community they one day hope to be a part of.  However, despite these positive aspects of the thesis, the thesis wouldn’t necessarily benefit every student’s Princeton career. Senior and junior independent work should be optional. These projects require a great magnitude of effort over a long period of time, on top of our other requirements during our junior and senior years. At the busiest and most important time in our academic careers, when we’re turning in work for higher level departmental courses and applying for graduate schools or jobs, the senior thesis could be a burden whose benefits aren’t comparable to its added pressure and stress. In these cases, having an optional thesis would allow for greater flexibility in students’ schedules, allowing them to allot time for other opportunities that could better contribute to their goals. For some students, a study abroad program might seem most suitable during their senior year, due to department and certificate requirements that must be completed during their first three years. In these cases, the senior thesis might hamper students’ chances of exploring their field outside of Princeton’s campus. To help students decide if they want to begin a longer independent project, it would make sense to set up a preparatory or exploratory program of seminars for students as soon as they are required to choose their majors. As an ecology and evolutionary biology major hopeful, I’d certainly prefer it if I could take a survey seminar that sampled a variety of topics, based on many different professors’ research, before I had to choose an adviser. An optional system would also give students greater flexibility in choosing advisers. Currently, students generally choose an adviser on the basis of the professor’s research, necessitating them to find thesis advisers before they’ve become well acquainted with the professor, the professor’s research or the process of writing a thesis as a whole. Getting to know more potential advisers could also give some students the ability to work on multiple shorter independent projects. For many students, a portfolio format might be preferable to the long-form independent projects. To create such a portfolio, students could complete smaller intensive projects such as those they would be assigned to complete in an actual work setting. For each of these smaller projects, students could have the option to stay with one adviser or explore the department’s faculty, allowing them to leave with a greater sense of what that field really has to offer. An optional thesis or series of independent work would also better complement the University’s grading policy. Currently, students are given letter grades on junior independent work and theses, in the same manner as they would be given letter grades for classes. However, I question whether the practice of assigning letter grades fulfills the goals of innovation and creativity that I would hope a senior thesis would try to accomplish. Theses should be reviewed for accuracy and edited for excellence. However, once revision is complete, it should not be necessary to rank different projects according to a formal academic scale, especially a quantitative scale. Departments at Princeton currently honor certain exceptional theses, providing those students with distinction based on “grades received by the student in departmental studies in the sophomore, junior, and senior years (including junior independent work, the senior thesis, and, for students in the A.B. program, the senior departmental examination).” As a student who’s admittedly terrified of producing a flop, but nonetheless interested and inspired by out-of-the-box ideas and unexplored topics, I’d find myself hard-pressed to take the easy route and follow the institution’s perception of excellence — of what a “good thesis” is. Under a different system, I could be encouraged to pursue a less conventional topic that I’d want to explore in my future career or academic pursuits, risk or no risk.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.

57309|~|Respecting the office|~|   February 25 2014|~|Column | Feb. 25 |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|This past Friday, Ted Nugent issued a half-hearted, half-assed (though existent) apology for calling President Obama a “subhuman mongrel” while at a rally for Greg Abbott, attorney general of Texas and candidate for governor. This incident made me remember something I hadn’t thought of in a while: the flagrant and pervasive disrespect for the office of the presidency that has existed on an unprecedented level in the political sphere since, say, Jan. 20, 2009 (what a coincidence). Since the president has taken office, we’ve seen Ted Nugent publicly say the president should “suck my machine gun,” Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer wagging her finger in his face while yelling at him, as though scolding a child, Congressman Joe Wilson yelling “you lie” during a State of the Union and Daily Caller reporter Neil Munro interrupting a Rose Garden speech to heckle the elected leader of the free world. These incidents, however, only scratch the surface of the attitude of disrespect toward the current occupant of the most powerful office anyone can hold. I’m not saying no president has ever been disrespected before, nor am I saying it’s unacceptable to disagree with and revile the policies enacted by a president’s administration. But the attacks against the current president seem to be more frequent, more radical and more likely to come from people in positions of actual authority or influence. This begs the question of why now. I tend to buy the obvious answer that such disrespect for the office is derived from a racist belief that its current holder is not “one of us,” isn’t American, isn’t Christian, is a communist. It’s much easier to rationalize calling someone who commands an army of four million a “subhuman mongrel” when you don’t believe he’s the legitimate leader of your country, of your people. But the choice of the phrase “subhuman” is particularly of note, and it’s why I’ve chosen to write this column now. I believe, more than any other of these events, the most recent Nugent scandal reveals unquestionably the racial element in all this. In the psyche of some, it is abundantly clear, there is still something unsettling about a biracial man with a “foreign-sounding” name being their president. The “otherization” that is so often inherent in modern, less overt racism has been playing itself out on the grand stage of American politics for over five years. Generations of dehumanization, from slavery onward, are called to mind when we hear the phrase “subhuman mongrel.” It expressly and intentionally makes us see the president as an illegitimate non-person, and why therefore would we need to respect him? It is not a coincidence that such dehumanization began with the election of the first non-fully white man to the presidency. But people are hesitant to say so because it ruins the image we as a society like to construct, that a black man reaching the Oval Office symbolizes the end of centuries of racial oppression. It confirms that people, even those calculating and savvy enough to get elected to a governor’s mansion, still, in 2014, fear the “other.” It means that the work of those seeking real racial equality is still far from finished, which everyone involved already knew, but which is often swept under the rug in service of a revised historical narrative that sounds much more palatable. If we’re actually to become a society with racial equality, we have to acknowledge inequality wherever it exists and in whatever form. We can’t sweep such ridiculous, disrespectful behavior under the rug, and we can’t ignore the fact that the gravitas of the presidency is currently being allowed to flounder, all in the name of saving face and keeping up images of a well-integrated, equal society. The standing of the office matters too much for that to continue to happen, for our country’s reputation around the world and for the ability of any president to use the “bully pulpit” and to get things done.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

57312|~|Editorial: Enhance Tiger Tuesdays|~|   February 25 2014|~|Editorial | Feb. 25 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|In 2011, the University instituted a single-choice early action application round, allowing high school seniors to receive an offer of acceptance as early as mid-December. In tandem with this new opportunity to attract and enroll prospective students, the Office of Admission created its Tiger Tuesdays program, which designates certain Tuesdays in February for early-admitted students to visit campus and hopefully decide to matriculate at Princeton. The Board believes that Tiger Tuesdays fail to live up to their full potential, and we call for a revamping of the program to further attract prospective students. Due to various structural problems, the Tiger Tuesdays program as it stands now fails to effectively sell the University to admitted students. The day program is naturally biased toward students in the Northeast area: There is little incentive for a student across the globe to travel and spend only one morning and afternoon on Princeton’s campus. Perhaps the trip would be worthwhile if the day’s events were diverse and interesting; yet another fault of the Tiger Tuesdays program is its shortage of events. Lacking any extracurricular activities, Tiger Tuesdays solely consist of a lunch with a current undergraduate and the ability to take a campus tour, listen to a standard admission information session or attend class, all of which lack worthwhile interaction with undergraduates. The program is also poorly advertised on campus. While students will find posters or mass emails constantly reminding them of the upcoming Princeton Preview weekends, perhaps the only indicators of a Tiger Tuesday are those on the day-of: the multitudes of seemingly lost high school students carrying the same plastic orange bag and staring at the same brochures or campus maps. Because of frequent and well-organized reminders, undergraduates can become excited to connect with the prefrosh during Princeton Preview; the same cannot be said for Tiger Tuesdays. Increasing opportunities for prefrosh to interact with undergraduates would greatly improve Tiger Tuesdays. In terms of a timeline, the Board advocates for Tiger Tuesdays to become an overnight program. Similar to during Preview, all students would have the option of staying one night in an undergraduate host’s dorm. Upon establishing this overnight option, the Office of Admission should also pay for students’ travel expenses if they will be receiving financial aid. Enabling an overnight option to all students also allows for a host of activities. Instead of the traditional dry panels or info sessions (as during Preview), an informal meet-and-greet between prefrosh and current undergraduates (for example, residential college advisers or student group leaders) would serve as a great, low-stress opportunity for facilitating this interaction. In addition, the Office of Admission could compile a list of student groups who have regularly scheduled activities (e.g., choral groups with Tuesday night rehearsals) for prefrosh to attend and immerse themselves in Princeton’s vibrant extracurricular community. Since admitted students would be staying overnight, undergraduates could also host dinners, especially at the eating clubs, so that students can briefly experience the vital social atmosphere of the Street. The Board recognizes that expanding the Tiger Tuesdays program could potentially separate the freshman class between those who were accepted early and consequently were “privileged” to Tiger Tuesdays and those who were accepted during the regular round. However, we feel that this exclusion tends to evaporate anyway due to the structure of freshman week and advisee groups, which do an excellent job of integrating all freshmen into their own diverse community. Overall, the Board recognizes the importance of the Tiger Tuesdays program in the admission process. The Board believes that through increasing prospective students’ interaction with undergraduates, Tiger Tuesdays can become more successful and become a perfect way to get prospective admits excited about coming to Princeton.|~|

57101|~|Ice queen |~|   February 24 2014|~|Column | Feb. 24 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I dashed up two flights of stairs to the Frist Campus Center television lounge after having endured the mandatory 15-minute post-meningitis vaccine waiting period. Yuna Kim was about to skate for the long program portion of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics figure skating competition, and I was desperate to watch. Twenty or so Korean American Student Association members already dominated the first two rows. They collectively gasped and reached for each other when Yuna stepped onto the ice. Even as I chuckled at their antics, my heart started to beat ever-so-slightly faster. Some may marvel at the intensity and persistence of Yuna Kim’s native fans. From an outsider’s point of view, it is hard to understand why many South Koreans regard Yuna Kim as so much more than just an astounding athlete. Nationally, Yuna Kim has transcended the title of national athlete and achieved unprecedented celebrity status. Lean, long-limbed and delicate, Yuna Kim is the physical ideal and has starred in countless campaigns and commercials. She has also surprised her fans with her lovely singing voice, showcasing a lesser-known talent. Having trained extensively in Toronto, Kim speaks decent English with only a slight accent — a feat admired by Koreans, who often view good English as a means of achieving success. Her English-speaking ability, her fame and her air of dignity and poise are thought to have played a crucial part in the election of Pyeongchang, South Korea as the next host city for the Winter Olympics. Even her somewhat icy disposition is perceived positively, adding to her title “Ice Queen.” Yuna Kim’s success was consistent and long-lasting. Since her senior career began in 2006, she has never once failed to reach the podium at any competition. Her comeback performances after her hiatuses — which were due to injuries and possible retirement — were always stellar. My father once said, “Kim Yuna does all the work, and Korea’s just taking a free ride on her success.” Indeed, it seemed as though South Korea’s Ice Queen never failed to deliver, regardless of the increasing pressure from and expectations of her country. Until her seemingly sudden emergence as a formidable figure skater, South Korea had not ever been represented so prominently and outstandingly in any sport. As a rising nation with a rapidly growing economy, South Korea was bolstered by a name they could proudly present to the major arena of world sports. So, the reaction of fans in South Korea — and here at Princeton — to Adelina Sotnikova’s upset victory last Thursday is understandable. Fellow Princeton Korean students groaned in protest and disappointment when they saw Kim’s scores: They were exceptional, but not enough to beat Sotnikova’s even more outstanding overall score. My Facebook feed — and the Internet — immediately blew up with angry statuses and accusations of rigging. Politics and controversy aside, I was somewhat disappointed by the reactions of my peers. I understand just as well as anyone the joyous satisfaction of a national athlete’s victory and the bitter disappointment of a loss. However, we are all aware of the dangers of jingoism and excessive nationalism that comes hand-in-hand with the Olympics. As Princeton students, we operate under the unofficial motto, “In the Nation’s Service and in the Service of All Nations.” We would do well to remember that we have a responsibility to act as informed, reasonable global citizens, especially in a time when most of the world is engaged in an event as controversial and heated as the Olympic Games. We should encourage the world to dismiss the notion that a nation’s performance in the Olympics defines how great that nation is, instead of corroborating it ourselves. To enraged Princeton fans of Yuna Kim: I am certain that most spectators of figure skating will agree there has not been, and probably never will be, a skater like Yuna Kim. It may even be true that there have been competitions in which her victory was irrefutable. However, the act of judging a figure skating competition is inherently subjective. Kim’s performance on Thursday was deserving of the gold, but deserving is never a guarantee. Kim herself has said that what she wanted from the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics was not a medal but an end to her figure skating career that would make her proud. She is eager to leave behind a successful career, to rest, and to start a new life. We may care about the difference between silver and gold, but I’ll venture to say that in the grand scheme of things, Yuna Kim doesn’t.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan. She can be reached at ljkim@princeton.edu. 
57136|~|Patton's error: The how, not the who|~|   February 24 2014|~|Column | Feb. 24 |~|Lauren Davis|~|   Columnist     |~|You, as well as I, have probably grown tired of hearing the same critiques of the matchmakerly advice given by Susan Patton ’77 — that she entrenches antifeminist ideas or is closed-mindedly elitist and gender normative. So, as a change of pace, rather than dealing with any of her points specifically, I’d like to offer a different argument: that, on the macro level, Patton is simply missing the point. In the question of marital satisfaction, she focuses entirely upon the who and not the how of lifelong relationships. Patton’s discussion focuses on the end goal of nabbing a life partner, but not the skills — developing self-knowledge, the capacity to love and the communication skills — which lead to finding a healthy relationship that can flourish long after marriage vows have been made. Fulfilling relationships are not up to luck or fate or aggressively strategizing your romantic life while in college. Rather, they are based fundamentally on knowledge of yourself, your strengths and vulnerabilities and your ability to communicate to and accept these things in another person. These are skills that must be learned, practiced and honed over a lifetime. I have no issue with the importance Patton places on finding a suitable husband or wife — of course, this is something that a statistical majority of us want, and it will hugely impact the course of our lives and happiness. And she is right that many do not give it the attention it deserves. But Patton frames the issue of lifelong marital satisfaction as yet another hoop to jump through: a box to check off, like our next internship application or homework assignment. As much as we type A, high-achieving Princeton students don’t want to hear this, not everything can be accomplished through striving and working hard — except, perhaps when those intentions are turned inward, upon yourself. Instead of telling us to treat the search for a significant other like yet another item on our to-do list, Patton should instead be encouraging introspection, the nourishment of our passions and the development of close friendships, romantic or not. These are the kinds of valuable pursuits that will form the foundation of the people we want to become — not a process of constantly looking outside ourselves and waiting for the universe to drop happiness and a husband into our laps. Happiness must be cultivated from within, not captured from without. Perhaps better advice, for those of us interested, would be to take a class like “Marriage 101,” which has been offered by Northwestern University for the past 14 years. The class aims to help its students to “develop the skills necessary to build loving and lasting partnerships and marriages” by offering biology, psychology and sociology in its teaching of topics such as “Getting to Know Yourself,” “Sexual Intimacy,” “Managing Conflict and Fighting Fair” and “Common Problems of Marriage.” As I’ve written before, a holistic education of the mind — learning the skills of self-awareness, emotional regulation, and developing a set of inner directives or values — is something that is not at all addressed by formal education, but should be. I’ve only recently had a chance to begin formally developing these skills after starting individual psychotherapy, but I could have easily learned many of the basics in a classroom setting. Alexandra Solomon, the head professor of Marriage 101 and licensed clinical family psychologist, said in The Atlantic that developmentally, college is when we are supposed to be grappling with and developing these kinds of emotional and, for lack of a better word, spiritual skills. “Students are thinking about who they are as people, how they love, who they love, and who they want as a partner,” Solomon said. If an education of our persons, not just our intellects, were incorporated into the college, or even high school curriculum, perhaps we would all be tending to our emotional wellbeing more actively than we do now — a solution that could likely please both Patton and her detractors. An awareness of what contentment entails for each of us, as unique individuals with different needs and talents, would encompass our capacity to make all kinds of decisions about our lives: friendships and careers, as well as significant others. It’s cheesy, but as the old adage goes, how can we know and love someone else if we don’t first know and love ourselves?|~|Lauren Davis is a philosophy major from London, England.

57103|~|Activities? How about everything?|~|   February 24 2014|~|Column | Feb. 24 |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|It’s no secret that Princeton students like to be involved. Admittedly, the number of student groups on campus is impressive given the size of the student body. There are 38 varsity sports, 35 club sports and over 350 student-led groups for a student body of just over 5,000. This demonstrates great commitment from such a dedicated and goal-oriented student body. At least, that’s what I thought. It’s hard to believe that students can be so involved because in reality, they are not. In reality, looking deeper into many of the groups on campus reveals that many are poorly organized and have no real value beyond resume building. I am not trying to pick on extracurricular activities. Many groups on campus, especially the performance groups, produce and do amazing things. But if you love doing something, devoting time to it isn’t a chore. And for every legitimate group on campus, there are a handful of duds operating with little to no purpose other than to give students something to do. Have a great idea that would look impressive on a resume for medical school or that dream job you want? Great. Reserve a room in Frist, gather a handful of freshmen, meet once a week, and proceed to get absolutely nothing done. I’ve scouted my fair share of volunteer organizations only to find they are inefficiently run and little gets done. The members do the bare minimum of going to meetings, but the plans almost never come to fruition. Then again, who could expect anything more? It’s simply unreasonable to expect students to be able to devote a productive amount of time to five or six different organizations on top of academics. Luckily, you don’t have to be productive. There is little to no accountability for maintaining productivity. Unless you are seriously invested in the productivity of the group, what is your motivation for contributing? This is not a job. There is no money at stake. There is nobody looking over your shoulder or checking up on your progress, and the result is apathy. I’m not entirely sure if outside accountability is even possible. That is the definition of volunteering: You contribute what you want to contribute. Ideally, you care enough about what you are doing to want to make a significant impact. In the real world, organizations that matter, the ones that truly make a difference, are huge endeavors that require the time, effort and perseverance of full-time jobs. No matter what you set out to do, commit yourself to it, or don’t bother doing it at all. Wendy Kopp ’89 did not start Teach for America as an afterthought, thinking it would land her a job at Goldman Sachs. She poured her life into a vision she believed would change the world. Unfortunately, like most things at the University, volunteer organizations have become a competition. But because there is no way to gauge your value to an organization, the motivation isn’t to make a real contribution. Instead, it’s a game of participation. Devoting yourself to one cause that you personally support just isn’t enough. “You mean you’re only helping to teach kids in India how to read? But what about saving the African rainforests?” When you stretch your already limited time across as many things as you can think of, the actual value you offer to each individual group shrinks. At 3 a.m., when you find yourself split between a chemistry test the next day and a presentation on a project you care little about, what do you suppose is going to win in the end? I would love to see a change in the dynamic of student participation. If there is a cause that you feel passionate about and want to pursue, I fully support it. In fact, I encourage it. Given enough effort, you have the ability to change the world if you are truly passionate. Who knows? Maybe it will even get you into Harvard Medical School.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pa. He can be reached at cjw5@princeton.edu.

56995|~|Naming the ironmakers|~|   February 23 2014|~|Column | Feb. 23 |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|According to Major E.C. Lewis, president of the Louisville and Nashville Terminal Company, James Robertson was 5’9” with a heavy build, slender body and private demeanor. Along with being the bearer of my surname, he had many prominent features, including a “square, full forehead” and the “quiet consciousness of power” fit for kings. He achieved fame as an explorer and pioneer in the South alongside Daniel Boone, the American folklore hero and founder of Kentucky. From onlookers he acquired great esteem, not unlike that rewarded to celebrities. Although he could not boast of a titled heritage, his repute was so fabled as to earn him the moniker, “Father of Middle Tennessee” (an appropriate title for a founder of Nashville). If you are confused as to how an African-American could have labored so fruitfully in the late 19th century, your skepticism is well-founded. But James Robertson, unlike me, had blue eyes. If you asked me why I am here at Princeton, I would say, “To learn who I am.” If you then asked me what that meant, I would tell you, “It means learning what it is to be black.” If you told me such an objective was short-sighted and limited, I might agree. Or, I would argue that bound to the condition of my “blackness” are questions of regionalism and spirituality. This became clear to me only within the last few months, and these discoveries prompted me to join the Black Student Union. I recently attended a discussion sponsored by the Black Student Union entitled, “50 Shades of Black: A Discussion on Black Identity.” Early in the conversation, one student who identified as African-American (as opposed to African, Afro-Caribbean, etc.) observed that while many people of African heritage may be able to identify their predecessors with relative ease, most African-Americans have been divested of that luxury. Although I was aware of this before, her remark confirmed that the growth of my racial consciousness has coincided with a burgeoning interest in my own ancestry. This was the first BSU discussion I attended, and already I realized how much I might have sacrificed by not becoming involved with the group in the fall. My experience with BSU, of course, is idiosyncratic. More importantly, I think, is the acknowledgement of resources at Princeton — culturally-oriented groups, for example — that allow one to connect with the past. It is with this newly-acknowledged vigor that I conducted a search for something — anything — illuminating. There was no purpose to this search except to learn of unfamiliar people: aunts or uncles, first- or second-cousins or perhaps the unfortunately rare gem of a great-great grandparent. I had heard tales of James Robertson before, but never did I bother to understand the whole narrative. You can imagine my surprise when I read that a small community just north of Charlotte, Tenn. called Promise Land was settled by freedmen who had once worked for Robertson as slaves on farms and workers in the iron yards of Cumberland Furnace. Promise Land. It was where my Papa smoked and hunted, and where my Granny prayed and laughed. I was beginning to understand that the most precious inheritance is that of a name, even if it comes from the quenching of my own past. With James Robertson, my history both begins and ends. I can only imagine who may have come before Jerry Robertson, born 1898, the first black man to whom my lineage can be traced, so far as I know. I come from the anonymous blacksmiths, housekeepers, farmhands, cooks, nursemaids and colliers of the South. Fortunately, you and I are in a position that allows us to extend our own names as far as we would have them go. It is so easy to lose the past while we are trying to determine the shape of our future. I write this if only to remind you that our origins do matter, even if we cannot all easily identify them. Our pasts do not have to be abstractions that are irrelevant to our present day. If we choose to integrate history more directly into our lives, however — by writing an account of a grandparent, researching a medical condition that is common in one’s family, etc. — we may begin to see how the hand of the past can enhance a community of skilled and unique individuals. In my last article, I alluded to the undercurrent of fear that accompanies a life of nondistinction (i.e. having many good traits and skills, but none that distinguish you as excellent, according to societal standards). But I believe our personal histories are the clearest mediums through which we can claim to be truly exceptional. By leaving Princeton with a greater understanding of your historical background and finding ways to apply it to your life, you will have accomplished something no one else could. It is that claim to something which is irrevocably yours that makes this such a valuable pursuit.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich. He can be reached at aaroncr@princeton.edu. 
56969|~|Controversial views must be debated, not boycotted|~|   February 23 2014|~|Column | Feb. 23 |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|I’ll discuss pretty much any topic with anyone, including a complete stranger. I just really enjoy hearing other people’s views and offering my own — a large part of why I am an opinion columnist. But there is one topic I avoid talking about with other students, my best friend and even my family. I just won’t discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with people.  Every time I do, tensions run high, sparks fly and people end up extremely upset. The discussion rarely gets anywhere before the other person gets so upset she or he storms off — and I’m referring to people who normally can hold civilized debates even when we argue extremely different opinions. The Israel-Palestine debate is an incredibly complex situation that strikes a very personal chord with a lot of people both here and overseas. I suppose it’s because of these strong feelings that constructive debate often appears impossible to achieve. With excellent points on both sides, many people are just too emotionally invested in their own opinion to listen calmly to opposing views and criticisms. Too often we allow these emotions to get in the way of being willing to listen respectfully and discuss the entire conflict and possible solutions with others. Often I’m guilty of this myself. Nevertheless, I think it’s essential that people, especially students who might just be the key to finding a peaceful solution over the next decade or sooner, try to open themselves up and at least be receptive to listening to others’ points of view, even if they disagree with yours. The recent controversy surrounding Richard Falk’s self-acknowledged contentious lecture last week on campus highlights the importance of listening to others and having informed debates on the issue, rather than merely retreating to the comfort of silence, activism or merely discussing the crisis with those who agree with you. I don’t think any of these actions are bad, per se; I completely support people standing up for what they believe. It’s when these things are the only course of action and no attempts at cross-aisle discussions are made that these actions can impede finding a solution. Don’t get me wrong — I am proud of much of the debate and activism that occurred around campus before and during the event. I think the letter to the editor from a few members of the English department was a great way to open debate on the issue. The letter did not proclaim that Falk not speak nor that people not attend, it just stated that the authors disassociated themselves from the department’s co-sponsorship of  the lecture. I also support the lecture attendees who asked tough questions either in support or in opposition of Falk’s views during the Q&A period at the end. And I applaud those handing out flyers with their beliefs. I do believe a respectful discussion is even more beneficial than dissenting activism, like people handing out posters or other related actions, in moving forward toward a solution or at the very least understanding those with opposing views. But these protests do keep the conversation going and introduce various opinions together in one forum, even if they are not yet in conversation. What worries me is some people who oppose Falk’s opinions were discouraging students from attending. And while I understand this is one way of voicing your opinion, the key difference is that by not even listening to the other side, you automatically stifle debate. This abstention fails to bring us any closer to a viable and sustainable solution. I don’t care if you don’t agree and won’t be persuaded — there is still inherent value in listening to others and at least trying to understand the motivation behind their perspective. The emotions and strongly held personal beliefs certainly make any Israel/Palestine discussion contentious, but that also holds true for other topics. I know I get worked up when capital punishment issues come up, but somehow I can still discuss this issue with others. Yet both on campus and beyond, even the idea of a dialogue regarding Israel and Palestine is often seen as acceptance of the legitimacy of the other groups’ opinions. That preconception needs to change, and it can only do so through creating channels of dialogue. You can talk with others, and even recognize some truth to their arguments, without agreeing with their stance. We do so with other issues, and it’s time we engage in civilized discussions about difficult topics like the Israel/Palestine conflict with those who hold different opinions, whether this is around the dinner table or in a more formal setting. The groundwork is already being laid — members of student activist groups have been holding regular meetings together to discuss this issue. Hopefully the rest of the student body can follow their lead and from that we can effect broader change to the tone of the discussion throughout Princeton and beyond.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C.

56958|~|Editorial: Improving job and internship recruitment |~|   February 23 2014|~|Editorial | Feb. 23 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Twice a year, anxious juniors and seniors head to Career Services to attempt to find jobs or internships for the next summer or for the following year. For these students, the season consists of attending information sessions, meeting alumni, going to interviews and hopefully getting the job they want. For the most part, Career Services has made this process as easy as possible for us students. Princeton’s status as an elite university has allowed it to require companies to accommodate the needs of students, which makes going through the process remarkably easy and straightforward.  However, when it comes to junior year recruiting season the board would like to suggest Career Services work with companies to make the process more compatible with the academic schedule and demands of students. For many companies, especially those in finance and consulting, interviews for juniors occur in the first two weeks of school. For those applying to multiple opportunities, this can make it difficult to effectively shop classes and consolidate a schedule, do coursework and attend class. Some students report that they attend one or two classes over the entire first week back. In some ways this is ideal, since the first week of class is often lower on work. However, as a result, juniors participating in the process may be unable to effectively shop classes. In addition to being behind on work, they may also find themselves in classes they do not want to take as a product of not being able to attend introductory lectures to determine whether the material and the professor teaching it are a good fit for them. While some of this is inevitable, we feel that improvements can be made. The Board suggests that Career Services ask companies to consider using the weekends for some interviews. While this might not work with certain corporate schedules, we feel that companies, anxious to recruit at Princeton, would be willing to accommodate this change in the schedule. This would allow students to spread out their interviews and also schedule some of them on non-class days, allowing them to attend more of their classes and better attend to their classwork. We recognize that some companies must do their recruiting during the workweek. To deal with this issue we could allow them to schedule interviews during the week of Intersession to accommodate this need while still spreading out the calendar. While this would alter the plans of some students, we think that this change would better accommodate the needs of the juniors participating in recruiting as a whole and that most students would welcome the opportunity to focus on interviews at a time with few other demands.  Since our peer schools such as Harvard and Yale have earlier exam schedules, recruiting starts earlier on their campuses.  This means that their students attend earlier “super” or “final” days, interviews usually held at the company’s headquarters from which offers are extended, causing a possible disadvantage to Princeton students.  Beginning recruitment over Intersession would address this as well. Ultimately, students that participate in recruiting for certain companies will have to make sacrifices to be part of the process. However, the Board thinks that we should explore every way possible to make sure those sacrifices do not include academics. Exploring the movement of interviews to Intersession and weekends is a good place to start.|~|

56743|~|Letter to the Editor: Feb. 20, 2014|~|   February 20 2014|~|Letter to the Editor | Feb. 20 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|I write in response to the article of Feb. 19, “New TI membership almost 60 percent male,” by Ruby Shao. I commend The Daily Princetonian for paying attention to the important issue of gender dynamics in the eating clubs, which play a significant role in the social lives of most students. However, the article indirectly quotes the Cap & Gown president as describing “Cap as the first club to open up to women.” It should be corrected that Cap was not in fact the first club to admit women. While Cap played an important role in gender equality on the Street, its efforts were not as significant as those of the truly progressive clubs when it came to the early coeducation. The most progressive club was Colonial Club, and to a lesser extent, Terrace Club. Campus Club and Charter Club were also among the leaders in embracing gender equality. In its article of Dec. 4, 1970, “Five Clubs to Admit Women” by Al Campi, The Daily Princetonian published that while a number of other clubs already had female members, Cap, despite support for coeducation among its members, had not yet admitted women. The late 1960s were a turbulent time on the Street, and it is important to remember how much the eating clubs have changed since then. Today gender equality is a goal of every eating club, but I hope your readers will recognize that some clubs were on the leading edge much more than others. Yours sincerely, Julian Dean ’13 New York, NY The article referenced in this Letter to the Editor originally said that Cap was ”the first club to open up to women in 1972″ and attributed this information to outgoing club president Justin Perez ’14. Although Perez did say that Cap was the first club to open up to women, he did not provide the 1972 date, and this information should not have been attributed to him. The 1972 date could not be independently verified. According to a timeline prepared by the Task Force on Relationships between the University and the Eating Clubs, Cap admitted women starting in 1970.|~|Clarification from the editor 
56732|~|America the beautiful|~|   February 20 2014|~|Column | Feb. 20 |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I, like many students here, spent my final afternoon before classes squeezed onto a couch to watch the Super Bowl. Besides marking the culmination of the National Football League season, the Super Bowl also doubles as a celebration of American culture that is second only to the Fourth of July. Game-day parties serve all-American Buffalo wings as hors d’oeuvres and all-American burgers as entrées while attendees enjoy the all-American sport of football. It is therefore unsurprising that many of the hit Super Bowl commercials have a subtle, patriotic undertone meant to tickle our egos, making us nod and think, “that’s right, this is America, and we’re still on top.” And so as a Coca-Cola commercial flicked through scenes of different aspects of American society as a multilingual rendition of “America the Beautiful” played, I considered it an obvious attempt to celebrate the United States’ diversity while still reminding viewers that we are always united by our flag and, of course, by Coke. The next day, however, I realized not everyone shared my same sentiment towards Coca-Cola’s advertisement. I was shocked to discover that since the commercial had aired, social media had exploded with attacks on the soda company and the hashtag “SpeakAmerican” was soon trending on Twitter. Somehow Coca-Cola’s celebration of the “melting pot” population of America had been warped into a misguided hate campaign. The hashtag “SpeakAmerican” and similar responses to the commercial call into question the validity of United States citizenship for any individuals who lack European ancestry or whose primary language is anything other than English. Since citizenship — for many — goes beyond de jure implications and instead becomes an integrated part of one’s identity, such homogenizing attacks create a dangerous identity crisis for America’s distinct populations. The episode disturbed me, but what I found even more disconcerting was the lack of conversation about it on campus; instead the discussions I overheard were more focused on bicker season and other events only immediately pertinent to Princeton students. I hope the silence was due to the fact that the open minds of Princeton’s students saw no issues with the content of the ad and dismissed it as I had. Yet the general disinterest in the ensuing dramatics — however removed as they may have been from Princeton student’s own sentiments — reflects a similar apathy in the student body for issues beyond the Fitz-Randolph Gates. National activism, unlike on the campuses of Georgetown or University of Southern California — which are among the top ten most politically active universities in the country according to the Princeton Review — takes a backseat in the routines of most students at Princeton. News from outside campus seems to be diffused as it enters the Orange Bubble, causing a slight hiccup of a reaction that quickly fizzles out. It’s not that we do not have opinions about national and global news (we are a driven student population), we simply do not have the passion to manifest our opinions into any sort of campaign or movement. While we are a highly involved campus in terms of student activities, I have yet to see a campus protest or greater community campaign organized by Princeton students. As citizens or residents of the United States, our campus should be more involved in national debates whether they relate to daily campus life or not as some of my fellow columnists have pointed out in the past. University students have historically been critical mechanisms for political change, protesting and demonstrating on national stages to advance their cause. Such passion and involvement is unusually absent on a campus so poised to produce the nation’s future leaders and decision makers. Simply because debates such as the Coca-Cola commercial may be less disputed among Princeton students does not mean we should take the position of contented complacency while the world outside the Orange Bubble condones such xenophobia.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

56718|~|Class or crass?|~|   February 20 2014|~|Column | Feb. 20 |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|When Princeton students try to show their school spirit to non-Princeton students, it seems the line between engaging in genuine school appreciation and inter-university comparisons isn’t always clear. School appreciation isn’t reliant on what another university has — it is more centered on liking Princeton for Princeton’s sake, while inter-university comparisons often seem to make reference to Princeton being better than other institutions. For some of us, appreciation for and pride in our institution started the moment we ripped open the envelopes to our admission acceptance letters. For others, it could go back as far as past generations — to parents and grandparents who in their earlier years also proudly donned the orange and black. Inter-university comparisons, however, don’t always carry that same purity in its symbolism. They don’t carry that feeling of connection to a group of exceptional students that extends beyond our class year. While inter-university comparison and competition certainly has its place in athletics (after all, we do need a little rah-rah at football games), it shouldn’t change the way we view our university or the way we represent it to others. After the Harvard Crimson published a story around early December 2013 on the persistence of grade inflation at Harvard, many non-university-based news organizations followed suit, including CNN, The Boston Globe and The Washington Post. After all of the attention it gathered, students of other Ivy League institutions also began to take an interest in these stories on Harvard and to participate in the debate through social media. However, this “debating” wasn’t always the type of debate we would expect from Princeton students; it often devolved into petty insults and harsh remarks. Could it be that we’ve gone too far with the social network jibes — to the point of disparaging Harvard’s students who had no influence over their university’s grading system and could only do their best to excel despite what their system arbitrated? I can understand the indignation of Princeton students who have been subjected to grade deflation. On the other hand, does that really justify bad-mouthing or making condescending remarks in Facebook statuses and tweets for everyone to see? At some point, these remarks no longer seem to only express an opinion about another institution’s method of assessing its students’ quality of work. They seem like a somewhat childish and unprofessional attempt of elevating one’s university above another. In his Nov. 24, 2013 article, “Before Princeton bonfires, a debate over effigies and political correctness,” Andrew Steele discusses the decision not to burn an effigy of John Harvard or a Yale bulldog in celebration of the Princeton football team’s victory. Steele writes, “Olivia Adechi ’16 said … the bonfire has the potential to create school spirit and solidarity but that burning effigies is not appropriate. … ‘You can’t find an intellectual or justifiable explanation behind it.’ ” Reanalyzing the validity of past practices and redefining how far we’re willing to let our inter-school competitiveness go shouldn’t be limited to sports. Consider that one day we will graduate and Princeton won’t be our entire world. We’ll be thrown into the workplace, most likely along with our peers from universities such as Harvard and Yale. When this happens, I certainly hope we’re humble and respectful enough to accept and appreciate our colleagues as well as the new ideas they will bring to the table. Our lives do not stop at whatever institution we’re enrolled in or whatever team we find ourselves currently rooting for. So whenever students makes what they think are clever comments about another institution, I wonder what it would feel like if they said those comments to a coworker or collaborator who came from that institution, twenty years from now. Would we still find that behavior appropriate? When we become a part of an institution — whether it is a student organization, a university or a workplace — we essentially represent the “face” of that institution. And in this case, it’s Princeton we’re representing. It seems most college students have a real knack for screening what pictures they post on Facebook in case job interviewers ever stumble upon their profiles. Instead of just monitoring how we’re represented in the cyber-world or real world, we should also check our behaviors as we represent our universities. This might even mean skipping out on the opportunity to make a comment that someday might not seem so innocent or clever.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.

56553|~|The premed mindset is self-destructive |~|   February 19 2014|~|Column | Feb. 19 |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|As a molecular biology major, after every name/hometown/department introduction, I inevitably get asked, “Oh, so are you premed?” To be honest, I don’t know too many MOL majors who aren’t premed. There’s so much overlap between the departmental requirements for the former and the suggested coursework for the latter that a Venn diagram comparing the two would be very close to a circle. That being said, I never quite understood the stigma associated with being premed. We’re called cutthroat and vicious, GPA-obsessed and perennially on edge. Facets of these are something I’ve observed from the Princeton undergraduate population as a whole, particularly after finals week when you can’t walk 50 feet without hearing someone complain about his grades on SCORE, so why the premeds were pinned with the entirety of the responsibility was beyond me. That is, until this year, when I began taking more departmental classes and realized that we premeds are, in fact, exactly as bad as others say we are. I’m not sure what it is about the sciences that brings out the most competitive and, frankly, irritating side of people. I’ve heard kids list out the mind-numbing minutiae of their resumes to their lab partners, who have no choice but to listen quietly until their DNA sample finishes its hour-long incubation. I’ve seen freshmen with MCAT prep books worn and open on their desks, barely a year after they closed their big blue SAT ones for the last time. I’ve gotten rejection emails that cited the “competitive nature of medical internships” specifically, as though premeds being ultra-competitive was a hard fact. There are so many other preprofessional tracks that should be just as competitive — prelaw, for instance — that aren’t. Maybe it’s the precise courses premeds have to take, which put us all together in the same environment, so we know exactly whom we’ll be competing against senior year. Maybe it’s the reputation these classes have for having a larger time commitment or harsher curve. Regardless, the premed mindset is self-destructive. After hearing one of those friend-of-a-friend tales that’s passed down the department like a campfire horror story — this one about a girl with a solid GPA who couldn’t get into a single medical school in America — I sat in a shell-shocked panic all day. Maybe the premed mindset is in place for a reason, a sort of Darwinian trait that helps the fittest survive longest. That evening, I bookmarked every spreadsheet and bell curve Princeton publishes about medical school admissions and resolved to get on a first name basis with the director of Health Professions Advising. It took me a day to realize that the premed mindset is very strongly reminiscent of something all of us have gone through already. It’s the same mindset that got everyone one of us into Princeton in the first place — whether or not we’ll readily admit it. We studied for the SAT and made sure we were in the good books of those who would write our recommendations. We planned “rewarding and valuable” summer exploits and always knew what was up with the Forbes annual list of top colleges. The thing is, we had 12 whole years to prepare for the college application process, and I’ll be the first to admit it was an excessively stressful process. To have to launch back into it seven months after receiving an acceptance letter just isn’t healthy. There’s no grace period, no significant stretch of time to recoup before having to worry about resumes and recommendations all over again. What’s worse is that the past 18 years have been wiped clean. You’re starting over in the eyes of any member of a post-secondary education admissions committee. The easy answer is that we should just stop being so stressed, but that’s much easier said than done. The premed mindset isn’t going away. It’s a natural byproduct of the school we go to and the futures these students envision for themselves. However, it can be very toxic, and it’s important to remember that. It creates an environment of competition and pressure that isn’t good for anyone who has to partake in it. The worst-case scenario of premed culture is that you burn out — lose all motivation to keep working hard and shrink into crushing existentialism. It’s not a great endgame, and premeds should take all the competition with a tablespoon of salt. It’s not worth the stress if it’s going to cause a meltdown. It’s important to remember that for every horror story, there are at least four success stories. Princeton’s grade deflation policy sucks, but despite it, the University still boasts a medical school admission rate a good 40 percentage points above the national average. It’s easy to get caught up in premed culture — the comparisons and the competition — but we did all get into Princeton for a reason, and if we make a conscious effort not to place the utmost importance on any one facet of our educational careers, we’ll be just fine.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

56551|~|Comparing academic fields |~|   February 19 2014|~|Column | Feb. 19 |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|As first semester drew to a close and final grades came out, I was reminded of a common sentiment that I had heard from many of my engineering friends — that being an engineering major is “hard.” In and of itself, such a subjective statement isn’t really anything I can argue against. But then, of course, comes the catch — a B.S.E. degree isn’t just difficult, it’s more difficult than the alternative, an A.B. degree. Being an A.B. major myself (and finding it plenty difficult enough), I, of course, couldn’t let such claims slide. Undoubtedly, any subject at Princeton should, by virtue of the level of academic merit at our top-ranked institution, be challenging, and engineering classes are certainly no exception. But to claim that they are more arduous than other courses is simply an unfair argument. First and foremost, the active grade deflation policy applies evenly to all departments, regardless of affiliation with an engineering or a humanities subject, and thus, the distribution of grades received by students of both degree types would be roughly similar. Of course, grade distribution isn’t by itself a good measure of relative difficulty. After all, I could have very well gotten an A in one class by doing nothing more than simply attending lectures, and have gotten a B in a class that I pulled all-nighters studying for. To reconcile this contradiction, the claim that B.S.E. courses are harder often revolves not only on grading policy but also on the workload. In particular, engineers often (reasonably) grumble about the fact that the subject matter is often highly technical and requires a precise understanding of specific concepts, the lab sessions often exceed their supposed three-hour benchmark, and the homework assignments are notorious for consisting of lengthy problem sets replete with questions requiring ridiculous amounts of work. But these facts do not in any way justify the claim that engineering courses are more difficult than humanities subjects. Admittedly, most humanities classes do not assign weekly problem sets for homework, nor do they involve lab sessions. But what they lack in direct homework and labs, they make up for with large amounts of reading, as well as intensive discussion sessions during precept. The readings can be quite lengthy, as noted in previous Daily Princetonian Opinion columns — upwards of hundreds of pages per week, often consisting of rather archaic primary sources or highly detailed analyses. And the precepts can host heated debates about complicated issues — just because the topics of discussion don’t involve numbers or scientific principles doesn’t make them any easier! Now, if you really wanted a hard line-in-the-sand quantification, I suppose that a good place to start would be to gather information from a random sampling of representative engineering classes and humanities classes, then compare the distributions of the times that it took students to complete the work for each of those two categories of classes as a good measure of the time-intensiveness of each field. But these figures would be effectively meaningless with regards to measuring actual class difficulty, because to compare B.S.E. classes and A.B. classes is to compare two intrinsically different things. They teach, test for and require different skills; they enforce different methods of thinking, and ultimately, students’ propensities for one or the other will hinge on their unique individual academic dispositions. In the end, trying to say that either a B.S.E. degree or an A.B. degree is harder than the other is akin to comparing a crossword puzzle to a Rubik’s cube — both can be seen as difficult or challenging from certain angles, both can require lots of work to solve; different types of people will naturally find one to be simpler than (or perhaps preferable to) the other. Outside of college, there seems to be a rising perception that technical engineering-based jobs are more difficult than comparable non-scientific occupations; perhaps this can be attributed in part to the fact that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, all 10 of the top 10 highest-paying jobs in 2012 involved the medical field or related technologies involved in the medical field. (Chief executives were a close 11th, but didn’t make it to the top 10.) It seems that many assume that wage correlates with degree of job difficulty, and while such a fact may hold true if you compare the jobs of, say, a McDonald’s employee and a neurosurgeon, in the upper echelons of the income tier, the distinction becomes less clear. Who can say that an anesthesiologist’s job is any more difficult than a financial analyst’s, that a software engineer has a harder job than a lawyer? Instead of complaining about how difficult a field may be perceived to be relative to another, students should revel in the learning process and know that, ultimately, we are never alone in having difficulties.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

56543|~|What would Aretha Franklin do?|~|   February 19 2014|~|Column | Feb. 19 |~|Kinnari Shah|~|   Columnist     |~|“Last night, she said: ‘Oh, baby, I feel so down.  Oh it turns me off,  When I feel left out.’ ”  - The Strokes Last Saturday night: upstairs, in the bathroom stall of my own eating club. I hear a member of another club. Mine is called “alright.” But hers, in hers they “handpick the best members of every race.” I am aghast. Did I hear wrong? Did I mistake playfulness for pride? Others confirm the story though. They have heard the same sentiment touted at different times, in different locations. I didn’t even have to finish the story before a friend told me she knew exactly how it ended. I’ve never heard anything like that before. Stories, yes. But I’ve never heard such explicit and completely unabashed social engineering, not to this level. Perhaps I have taken the quotation out of context. Then again, I can’t imagine in which context it belongs. Two and a half years ago: reading “This Side of Paradise.” How cliché. I can’t say I generally like Fitzgerald’s characters. There is one chapter though, “Narcissus Off Duty,” in which a number of his fictitious junior Princetonians are considering leaving their clubs, banding together in protest. It’s an interesting thought. Fitzgerald calls eating clubs “an orgy of sociability.” I wonder if he is being hypocritical with that tone. I then wonder, just on a whim, if our sophomores or juniors would ever band together and protest the club system. I doubt it; they have no Burne Holiday. And he wasn’t even that great. Earlier this month: Bicker season. Everyone is complaining. Girls are standing around in the bathroom discussing other people as I brush my teeth. I don’t necessarily mind at this point, but many find it incessant. “They all hate it,” someone claims later at lunch. “But they’re too chicken to do anything about it, to stop doing it.” I don’t completely agree. I doubt that most of them truly hate it, and I think that, for most of the year, the rest of us don’t think about it all too much. At least, nobody ever does anything about it. It’s just for some of us, and it’s not for others. The trouble is that you don’t necessarily know which one you are, and you’re too scared to go it alone for a little while. That’s a real shame. Two years ago: full disclosure to the reader — hosed. Ouch. One year and eleven months ago: it doesn’t take too long for things to seem right back where they belong. We are rather resilient. We can find a place if we are open to being in some place unexpected. Two weekends ago, i.e. post-Bicker: out on the Street. People pull out their phones and read a text or email. Many of them cry. They’re out and they’re crying. What a visceral and public display of emotion that can’t be helped. This could have probably been handled differently. Whether the system stays or goes, continues unperturbed or changes, I don’t know. I do know that I have enjoyed my two years as a member of an eating club. The only thing for which I think we are all (to varying degrees) culpable is a lack of respect. Respect for other clubs and their members and their houses. Respect for bickerees. Respect for the person who gets hosed. You have to really mean it though. Just because we are divided by clubs, by membership and non-membership, doesn’t mean we should be divided. Through this perspective of mine you’ve just read, I come to one last thought that maybe people say but don’t mean enough: Don’t be afraid of things not working out at first. Have the courage to do something different from your friends if you know it’s what you really want. It will be alright. Don’t waste any of your time.|~|Kinnari Shah is a chemical and biological engineering major from Washington, N.J. She can be reached at kmshah@princeton.edu. 
56436|~|Editorial: Emphasize bystander intervention|~|   February 18 2014|~|Editorial | Feb. 18 |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|One in nine people are victims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking, defined by Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising Resources & Education as Power-Based Personal Violence, each year. The Board believes that in order to prevent PBPV on campus, assault prevention programs must emphasize “bystander intervention” to overcome the bystander effect. The bystander effect is the phenomenon of individuals not offering help to a victim when others are present. In fact, the probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders. Bystander intervention training aims to combat the bystander effect by giving students specific tools to act and prevent potential and occurring instances of sexual assault. In addition to being particularly useful in combating PBPV, bystander intervention training can also involve students, such as males, who have previously resisted involvement in PBPV issues on campus due to the perception that they are not potential victims. Since “bystander intervention” opens up the conversation to all students, the Board supports and encourages the presence of “bystander intervention” programs on campus. Beginning this past fall, freshmen were required to complete “Unless There’s Consent,” an online training module which promotes a shared understanding about unhealthy interactions and PBPV. “Unless There’s Consent” aims to give incoming students the tools to recognize potential cases of PBPV but has less of an emphasis on bystander intervention. SHARE believes RCAs are better equipped to provide guidance to help student victims and survivors in this domain. The Board recommends an increased “bystander intervention” component to the current online training module as well as preparing and requiring all RCAs to lead interactive bystander intervention trainings to their freshman advisees. Current intervention efforts are typically targeted at women. The “bystander intervention” approach, however, recognizes the importance of involving men in the effort. It is easier for an outsider (bystander) than a victim to stop potential or occurring assault, so it is important to ensure that every Princeton student has the training to know how and when to intervene. Because of the sense of shared responsibility this approach encourages, the Board believes this is the most effective avenue for combating PBPV on campus. One of SHARE’s efforts in increasing bystander intervention awareness is “Agent of Change,” a pilot online bystander intervention training program endorsed by the Graduate Inter-Club Council. The optional one-hour training was sent to all eating club members and strongly recommended by SHARE and Eating Club Officers. According to SHARE director Jacqueline Deitch-Stackhouse, the program encourages students to use bystander intervention tools to prevent acts of PBPV. The program was directly targeted at current upperclassmen to expand upon the limited training they received during freshman orientation. SHARE found that students who choose to participate in the program (as opposed to participating out of obligation) are more inclined to use what they learn, suggesting that a compulsory online training program is not the solution. In addition to “Agent of Change,” SHARE offers a small bystander intervention program “StandUP,” which provides workshops to various student groups on campus, including eating clubs and athletic teams to promote and teach bystander intervention methods. The Board supports the efforts of “Agent of Change” and “StandUp,” but believes that the reach of bystander intervention efforts should be augmented. Potential approaches include an awareness week specific to bystander intervention, modeled off of the current VIP week and expanding “StandUP” to providing more accessible and regular student-guided workshops.  While the Board agrees that compulsory training is not the most effective way to prevent sexual assault, the Board recommends using a portion of the SHARE funding recommend by the 2014 Priority Committee to expand the bystander intervention component of the already compulsory freshman training, increasing bystander awareness on campus and continuing the expansion of the availability of bystander intervention training.|~|Brandon Holt is recused due to his position as a SHARE peer. 
56314|~|Outside the Bubble: Double standards|~|   February 18 2014|~|Column | Feb. 18 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Two weeks ago, famed Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman — known for his roles in major films like Capote, The Ides of March and The Hunger Games — was found dead in his apartment of apparent heroin overdose. The 46-year-old actor, lauded by The New York Times as “perhaps the most ambitious and widely admired American actor of his generation,” had a history of drug abuse during college. Although he remained clean for more than 20 years, last year he fell off the wagon, checking himself into rehab. In light of this, his sudden death was a sobering and shocking surprise; many had thought he was completely clean. However, despite the loss of an amazing actor, many are conflating his cinematic talents with the acceptability of hard drugs like heroin. In the United States, there is a strong culture against hard drugs, with 86 percent opposing legalization of heroin in a recent Huffington Post/YouGov poll. Only the day before his death, NPR put out a piece on how 22 people in Pennsylvania overdosed the week and a half before because of a tainted batch of heroin. The public reaction was much less sympathetic. One commenter, writing before the news of Hoffman’s death was public, wrote: “I am not sympathetic to the plight of the addicts. Everyone knows it can and will eventually kill you. So when I hear about the ODs, my only regret is that we end up paying for their medical costs or funerals.” Another commented, “That’s one way to reduce the number of users.” Yet, in the case of Philip Seymour Hoffman, there were no chides against him or his activities, simply shock and sadness. I’m not saying that his death is not a tragic loss. It undoubtedly is. However, we need to realize the double standards we are perpetuating. Drug abuse is a growing national problem. For example, from 2002-12 alone, the number of heroin users in the United States jumped from around 400,000 to 700,000, and those numbers don’t even consider all of the other types of drugs that are abused. Yet, we continually think that most people who participate are not worthy of our help, let alone our sympathy. At the same time, on campus, drugs definitely are present. From the well-known story of former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, who was caught with “enough marijuana in his room to fill two size-12 shoe boxes,” LSD and prescription pills, to the several student arrests in the past school year alone, those who are found with drugs rarely face serious punishment. In Daniels’ case, he was charged a $350 fine for “maintaining a common nuisance.” I’ll admit that marijuana is no way even close to heroin in terms of its potency and danger. Yet, while Princeton students are getting a slap on the wrist, according to American journalist Eric Schlosser (best known for Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal), some people are “getting life without parole for a joint or for less than a joint.” As he notes, “by and large, the poor and working class people” are the ones who are getting imprisoned. In a period of great national divisions, evident with the rise of groups such as the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, it is easy to see why people are getting into a fuss. How are we, as a nation, supposed to move forward when we hold the well-educated, rich and famous to completely different standards than the poor and working class, who make up most of the population? By turning a blind eye to abuse and law-breaking from those at the top, we cement the idea in the head of the privileged who get away that their special treatment is not only acceptable, but also the norm. This not only makes most drug laws fail completely as a deterrent but also solidifies an elitist mindset. Once again, I’m not saying that Philip Seymour Hoffman should not be mourned. But when we dismiss his drug abuse in light of his other accomplishments, while continuing to deride thousands of ordinary Americans who deal with similar issues, we are only exacerbating the problem and creating more division. There are obviously numerous ways that one might potentially resolve this, from decriminalization to legalization or even stricter punishments. Regardless, it is clear that holding different parts of society to different standards of justice is the wrong answer. Hoffman will be remembered as a terrific actor and a lovable person, but even the greatest of men have flaws. We shouldn’t let his success or status blind us. All men are created equal should mean more to us than just a catchy slogan.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu.

56311|~|Nonprofit career fair should be an alternative, not an afterthought |~|   February 18 2014|~|Column | Feb. 18 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Each fall, hundreds of students venture over to the career fairs in Dillon Gymnasium, and this year, for the first time, I was among them. I spoke with some interesting representatives about interesting jobs, but the majority of the options presented there were not in line with my interests in arts, environmental advocacy and education reform. Many of the programs that were related to my interests were either Princeton programs (Princeton in Asia, Princeton in Africa, Project 55) or founded by Princeton alums (Teach for America). These are wonderful programs, with inspiring missions, and they offer opportunities to do great work. But it would be interesting to hear from organizations without this special connection to campus. After the career fair I attended, I started asking around and searching online, and I learned that a nonprofit career fair would be held separately, which perhaps explained the relative lack of diversity represented at the fall career fair. Unfortunately, the nonprofit career fair is held in February. By February, countless deadlines have passed, and seniors are getting anxious about next year, not to mention impending thesis deadlines. Granted, there are plenty of other ways to hear about interesting organizations and apply to jobs outside of Princeton-sponsored career fairs. Plus, the application deadlines for nonprofit jobs are often later, while recruiting for finance and consulting jobs happens early in the fall. Still, if Career Services is going to put in the effort of offering a nonprofit career fair, it should be presented as an alternative, not an afterthought. Or maybe, nonprofit careers should be better represented at the general career fairs, which would not necessitate a separate event. Last Friday, I went to check out the nonprofit career fair, which was held simultaneously with the summer internship fair. The Career Services website speaks of the two fairs in the plural, to indicate that these are separate events (which just happen to occur in the same place, at the same time). As soon as I set foot in the gym, a friend muttered to me ironically, “I wonder which side is which.” At the nonprofit side to our right, there were rows of tables covered in plastic tablecloths, each with a paper sign marking the organization situated there. Several of them were unoccupied, with signs but no representatives, perhaps because of the lousy weather. Students were milling about and talking with representatives or reading colorful pamphlets, while some of the representatives were eating lunch or observing the scene. To our left, the internship fair was a buzzing hive of activity. Students in dark suits, with resume folders and firm handshakes were intently engaged in conversation or else waiting in line for their turn. Tables were piled high with awesome freebies: T-shirts, travel mugs, candy, pens. Behind the tables were tall, flashy posters with bold logos. I couldn’t read the names of some of the companies because there were so many students crowded around the tables. The free gear on the internship side of the room seemed to say, “At these jobs you will be rewarded, in material and tangible ways.” The allure is irresistible. The free gear also creates a visible imbalance between the two events. Presenting internships and nonprofit careers side-by-side sends a message: Working at a nonprofit, like interning at a corporation, is a step on the way to something more legitimate, and probably higher paying. The implication is that nonprofit and civic service jobs, like internships, are not long-term options. The nonprofit fair also confirmed my fear that February is too late. I spoke at length with the representative for an environmental fellowship program, only to learn that its application deadline was that very day. People often imagine nonprofits as disorganized, bureaucratic and inefficient. This may be true for some small nonprofits, just as it can be true for any small company, but there are also brilliant, effective nonprofits of varying scales, from local to international. Some of them have no affiliation with Princeton but might be thrilled to hire talented and enthusiastic Princeton graduates. I want to see more representation from major aid organizations, advocacy groups and NGOs, like Oxfam International or Partners in Health, especially when the world leaders in technology, finance and consulting are so well-represented at these campus events. If the nonprofit career fair is going to continue as a separate event from the general career fair, it deserves its own time and place and should include an array of organizations with the influence and effectiveness that Princeton students look for in future employers. I’m not the first person to make remarks like these. Just last month, Azza Cohen ’16 and Kemy Lin ’15 wrote an interesting opinion piece in the ‘Prince’ about the dearth of opportunities advertised on campus for careers in the arts. Career Services can do better. Though perhaps an oversimplification, it is easy to see the career fairs as manifestations of Princeton’s priorities. Certainly there are other areas for change, but the career fairs are a good place to start.|~|Anna Nilles is an art and archaeology major from Wellesley, Mass.

56182|~|Outside the Bubble: Hacked!|~|   February 17 2014|~|Column | Feb. 17 |~|Katherine Zhao|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Shortly after New Year’s celebrations ended and the confetti in Times Square settled, something insidious slithered into the news: On the night of Dec. 31, a hacker posted 4.6 million Snapchat usernames and telephone numbers. The information was posted on a website called SnapchatDB.info by a hacker going by the alias “Lightcontact.” The site is now disabled, and programmers have created tools such as Snapcheck and GS Lookup that enable people to check if their information has been leaked. The consequences were not too severe and only telephone numbers and usernames were leaked. But what’s more unsettling than the security breach is the fact that it could have been prevented. In August, a computer security research firm, Gibson Security, which is a non-partisan group, warned Snapchat that sensitive information was vulnerable to a hack attack. When its warning was largely ignored by the mass Snapchatters and Snapchat headquarters, Gibson Security published another warning, this time in the form of a blog post. Ignored yet again, just days before the leak, an interview was released in which the firm spoke about Snapchat’s vulnerabilities again. Fortunately, only usernames and telephone numbers were revealed, and not vital information. When Target was hacked during the Black Friday period, 40 million credit and debit cards’ data were stolen and used to purchase goods in the stores. An app as widely used as Snapchat is very likely to be targeted by hackers who hone in on websites and apps with large user followings to obtain large sets of data. A fast-growing app with such a large following should have taken more steps to protect its users’ security. When a company, more focused on marketing and spreading the app to more customers, skimps on investment for data security, it may pay back even more for the negative press and reactions it will get after a successful hacking. Customers who use the app may be dissatisfied and close their accounts, resulting in lost revenue for the company. Many of my friends are on Snapchat. When the leak was exposed, my friends discussed the options of deleting their accounts or keeping them. One friend, who didn’t delete hers, said “I’m questioning it, but I think I’ll keep it for now and just keep an eye out for updates. If it doesn’t seem like Snapchat is going to anything security wise, I’ll reconsider getting rid of it.” One friend deleted her account, noting that she “didn’t want to take the risk, frankly,” and she also has Facebook, email and text messaging, which she can use to send pictures instead of Snapchat. The hacking of Snapchat, which affects so many of us, is perhaps a sign of something more sinister in our society. When Snapchat was hacked, it was a cause for concern because so many of my friends and peers had shared personal data with the app. In the age of information, where personal data are stored by these websites and apps, our data are vulnerable to hackers when we share our data with developers who don’t invest enough in security. We as consumers have a responsibility to be proactive about with whom we share our information. When information is so easily obtained through digital means, we also share in the responsibility of protecting our information. The Snapchat leak is something of a minor scale incident because relatively harmless information was revealed, but it could easily be a harbinger of more evil things to come. A “good hacker,” one that probes websites for weaknesses in their security systems, reported in early December 2013 that there was no security at all built in the entire website Healthcare.gov, the information hub of Obamacare until several weeks later. The Obamacare Data Hub, the part of the website that collects information from people who purchase Obamacare, was vulnerable to hacking by criminals and foreigners. Very sensitive information is stored in this site, including names, social security numbers, credit card data and tax information. When credit card information is exposed, people are highly vulnerable to identity theft. There seems to be a trend. Website developers focus on production and marketing of the website, with data security being an afterthought. But the consequences for neglecting to protect data are much harder to recover from than the effort it takes to prevent hacking before it happens.|~|Katherine Zhao is a freshman from East Brunswick, N.J.

56134|~|Meeting the sponsor|~|   February 17 2014|~|Column | Feb. 17 |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|As it stands, over 60 percent of the University’s undergraduates receive financial aid and the University’s no-loan program has been an incredible success over the years. Our $17 billion endowment can attest to that. But the monetary gifts that make such a substantial endowment possible start with the help of the alumni who feel the need to give back. And soon, we will be leading the way for Tigers after us to benefit from the fruits of our labor. Each year, the Office of Stewardship sends an email to financial aid recipients in order to encourage them to send thank you letters to their sponsors. But in order to bridge the gap between old and new Princetonians, I suggest having a personal meet and greet with individual sponsors and leaders of certain funds rather than merely sending a letter. The rationale for sending a letter is very simple: it is not time-consuming. Students can quickly draft a letter thanking their sponsors and send it off in a matter of minutes. But a meet and greet would be more beneficial because alumni would be able to actually see whose education their donations are funding. Alumni who attend would be able to link their money to a particular student whose academic aspirations and goals probably would not have been possible had it not been for their generosity. Getting students to meet with their benefactors could be quite a daunting task to accomplish due to scheduling conflicts among the countless alumni and hundreds of students who receive financial aid. This event would have to span at least a day, perhaps as an extension of Alumni Day. Alumni Day is already the closest analogue to this potential event. Students have the opportunity to reconnect with alumni through a series of lectures, dinners, symposiums, networking and other events. But during these events, the alumni are meeting countless students in very short spans of time. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the alumni are unable to establish any personal connection with current students. Establishing a meet and greet as part of Alumni Day celebrations, maybe in Prospect House or Dillon Gymnasium, would allow alumni to meet the students with whom they share a small part of Princetonian history — the cycle of annual giving. We as Princeton students should think more about the factors that allow us to be here. Often we look at the results of our own actions without thinking about who or what has helped us achieve all that we have in the first place. We spend so much time connecting with alumni for networking and fun during Reunions but not much time simply sharing their company in order to reflect on their charity. Personal interactions with those who have either directly or indirectly helped you gain success in life should be encouraged more. They give you an intimate story to tell to other Princetonians so that they in turn will be inspired to contribute. These bonds of shared experiences and charity are what strengthen any family, and we should be doing all that we can to make sure that no “relative” gets neglected. Actually meeting the people who help to make our education possible would be a nice place to start.|~|Morgan Jerkins is a comparative literature major from Williamstown, N.J.

56107|~|Susan Patton ’77 is unfair to men |~|   February 17 2014|~|Column | Feb. 17 |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|Around this time last year, an unnatural force stormed The Daily Princetonian website, campus and news networks everywhere. I speak, of course, of Susan Patton ’77, alumna of Old Nassau and self-proclaimed advisor to all Princeton women. In her letter to the editor, she advised female students to start the hunt for a husband immediately, for a number of reasons — the desirability of a woman decreases from her freshman to senior year, there is an amazing concentration of eligible bachelors here, and furthermore, our prospects decrease after college as we encounter less worthy men and begin to focus on our careers to the extent that romance takes the backseat in our life. In a nutshell, she says that women become less desirable the older they get, and men get less desirable the farther away women are from the Orange Bubble. Why might I be bringing this thoroughly annoying piece back to light? Recently, Patton wrote another letter in honor of Valentine’s Day, this time to the Wall Street Journal, mocking the single ladies who are “ordering in sushi for one and mooning over ‘Downton Abbey’ reruns.” First, both sushi and ‘Downton’ are great. But primarily, the article is a lot of the same drivel from her original piece. I know I should feel offended for women everywhere. Though she has a tiny disclaimer saying the married life is not for everyone, she essentially puts us all in a tiny box where husbands, babies and white picket fences are the most coveted prizes. The heteronormativity is off the charts. And frankly, anyone who says “you should be spending far more time planning for your husband than for your career” is not someone I want advice from as a 21st-century woman. Yet, I am hardly moved by this aspect of her piece. Societal constructs have been imprinting the same ideas that Patton is attempting to for centuries. At this point, I am most annoyed with her treatment of men. The greatest assumption of Patton’s argument is that we, as women, will never be surrounded by such a large number of amazing men and achieves a lot with a little. In short, she both fetishizes and puts male students of prestigious universities on a pedestal, one that women should be eager to scale in order to reach the prize of their love and commitment. There is a hint of merit in this notion — all students here are intelligent and exceptionally talented in whatever they pursue. Yet the name of your university does not tell me what your values are. It doesn’t hint at what your character is. And it most certainly does not tell me if you’re the type of person I can cozy up with to watch ‘Downton’ reruns while chowing down on California rolls. Patton still insists we catch a Princeton man as if he is a Pokémon. And if we are able to capture one, we can’t become physically intimate too quickly. Everyone knows the only way we can incentivize commitment for men is if sex is attached to the relationship. There is no other reason these base creatures would ever want to be monogamous, so we must sweeten the deal. Women cannot treat sex as a gratifying act of physical intimacy. Rather, it is a tool we can use in a larger power play of manipulating and maintaining a man. Still, the worst part about Patton’s analysis of men is the way she completely disparages those who are not from Princeton or a similar institution. Simply put, “Once you’re living off campus and in the real world, you’ll be stunned by how smart the men are not.” You can’t marry someone who is not your intellectual equal, and of course the only place you can find your intellectual equal is at a place like Princeton. Never mind that only 7 percent out of an enormous, competitive applicant pool is admitted every year. Never mind that there are other universities that nurture truly great minds. Never mind that someone who is not college-educated at all can still be an intelligent individual and that someone who does not attend Princeton can have greater insight on reality than some of us, living in such an insular, quasi-village. Patton wonders how we will survive if our significant others can’t discuss the merits of Henrik Ibsen or the Bayeux Tapestry. Well, I suppose the first half of my Princeton education has failed me, as I had to unashamedly Google both. Apparently even I can’t keep up with my ideal intellect. Personal happiness is important, and if having a romantic relationship is important for a female student, then she should pursue that interest. It is not fair to criticize anyone for wanting a relationship any more than it is for someone who does not. But to do so in the name of the romantic and sexual elitism Patton perpetuates is dangerous, foolish and unfair to men — Princetonian or not.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La.

55993|~|The Honor Code and the Dinky|~|   February 16 2014|~|Column | Feb. 16 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Anne Waldron Neumann More and more Princetonians complain about the University moving the Dinky station. Few of us do anything, however. That’s a pity because the University’s arts classrooms can be built without the move. Then the town and gown can guard a right-of-way that will soon let energy-saving light rail glide as far as Nassau Street. Since the University hasn’t undertaken any major construction yet, there’s still time, while a half-dozen legal challenges pend, to help stop the move. In fact, I’d like to call on some specific Princetonians to help stop the Dinky’s move by complaining. But let me start, perhaps surprisingly, with Kwame Appiah’s The Honor Code. Over the summer, University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 assigned it to all entering freshmen so it could be discussed throughout the year. And Appiah’s book can help stop the Dinky’s move. No, Appiah doesn’t mention the Dinky. He argues that changing ideas of honor rather than of morality, or of honor more than morality, or perhaps of both honor and morality, rapidly ended dueling and slavery in Britain and foot binding in China. Is Appiah’s historical account persuasive? Post hoc, ergo propter hoc? If some public-spirited Englishmen wrote about the national shame and immorality of African slavery in British territories, did changes in a widely-held honor code lead to abolition? I find Appiah more persuasive in his general arguments about the nature of honor. But I still conclude that Appiah’s book is mostly about men and power. Dueling reflected an honor code among gentlemen. Slavery supported male property rights. And bound feet, signifying social elevation, helped preserve female chastity and therefore male honor (and also became erotic for men). Test Appiah’s claims by considering American abolition. Two prominent 19th-century Americans thought the Civil War was caused by novels. Mark Twain wrote that Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe, an epic of knighthood, imbued Southern gentlemen with “medieval chivalry-silliness” and was “in great measure responsible for the war.” Abraham Lincoln, for his part, pointed to Uncle Tom’s Cabin. On meeting the author, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Lincoln reportedly said, “So you’re the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war!” That is, according to Twain and Lincoln, war resulted from distorted southern male honor, and abolition from a northern woman’s moral response to the Fugitive Slave Act. Or did war really start because powerful Northerners objected to southern states seceding in order to preserve their “peculiar” slave economy, thereby diminishing the national economy? Appiah is a moral philosopher, neither a historian nor an economist. And he does suggest to me how to save the Dinky and its right-of-way. The Princetonians I call on to complain publicly about moving the Dinky are the University’s tenured faculty, those professors most committed to living here and least dependent on their employer’s favor. Students could also complain, of course! Appiah suggests that people who share an honor code enforce that code by ostracizing those who break it. Honor helps drive human behavior because few of us can endure shame, because our happiness depends on our peers’ esteem. Princeton’s tenured faculty share both townspeople’s and Nassau Hall’s honor code. Tenured professors honor what we Princetonians honor: a walkable, energy-saving, civic-minded community, not one in which their wealthy employer sometimes acts unilaterally to serve its own interests. And, as Nassau Hall’s peers, professors can hold the University to a higher moral standard. We can all accord the University what Appiah calls “recognition respect,” recognizing its scholarship and power. But we can withhold our moral esteem until it meets our moral standards, until its scholars help bend its power toward responsible development. How might honor help when morality alone cannot, according to Appiah? We can act morally all by ourselves. But it takes a sense of honor to drive us beyond doing what is right: “It takes a sense of honor to feel implicated by the acts of others,” Appiah writes. Honor makes us insist that something be done when others do wrong. Please ask any tenured faculty members you know to take time from their scholarship and complain about moving the Dinky. Then complain to them if they don’t.|~|Anne Waldron Neumann is a resident of Princeton, NJ. She is also a member of Save the Dinky.  
55933|~|Editorial: Defining a University marijuana policy |~|   February 16 2014|~|Editorial | Feb. 16 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Recently, The Daily Princetonian reported on the arrest of a University student for the possession of less than 50 grams of marijuana and three Ritalin pills. Almost every year, a small number of University students have the misfortune of being caught with a small amount of marijuana. Given the legal status of the drug, these students immediately face strict University punishments as well as possible legal repercussions. However, when underage students are caught illicitly using alcohol, the University often only issues warnings and generally does not compel students to face the criminal justice system. Given this inequity as well as national trends surrounding marijuana, the Editorial Board believes that the University should modify its current policy and lower the level of punishment for marijuana possession to that of alcohol violations. While marijuana is illegal to all and alcohol only to those below the legal age, this fact alone should not merit a higher level of punishment to those who use the former. The ill effects of alcohol are well-established and range from short-term intoxication to long-term addiction and even death. In contrast, marijuana does not carry with it the same risk of dependency or overdose, despite resulting in similar levels of intoxication. However, despite the relative safety of marijuana compared to alcohol, offenses of possessing the former have a greater negative impact on students. The first marijuana offense involves probation as well as a permanent mark in a student’s record, whereas the first alcohol offense simply results in a dean’s warning. Further, the drug policy tells students to expect a suspension after the third drug offense, regardless of how small the offense, while a similar outcome results only after three of the most egregious of alcohol offenses. Finally, students with drug violations may be subject to mandatory state penalties while those with alcohol violations are usually only punished in the context of the University setting. For example, according to Public Safety, from 2010 to 2012, there were no arrests due to liquor law violations on campus but 15 for drug violations, of which nine were in residential facilities. While it is possible that not all of these were exclusively marijuana-related, like the most recent case, the fact remains that drugs receive far more severe treatment than alcohol. While the Board understands that some drugs should be punished severely, we maintain that this punishment differential de jure is unfair in the case of marijuana and should be amended to reflect scientific understanding of its effects. An initial objection to changing the University policy on marijuana might be that such a change would result in backlash against the University. However, this consideration is flawed on two fronts. First, the University’s alteration of its policy would be based in concern for the welfare of the students as well as in scientific fact. If the University’s aim is to promote safety, then it should not make use of alcohol, a more dangerous substance, a less risky proposition than the use of marijuana. Further, the University’s policy change is not without precedent. Over the past year, successful legalization efforts in Colorado and Washington have led other states to question the sensibility of a marijuana ban. State-level marijuana industries have even received sanction from the Obama administration, and the president himself has equated the danger of marijuana to that of alcohol. A change in University policy would come on the heels of a growing national movement, one that is likely to pick up speed in the coming years. The Board understands that there are other reasons why the use of marijuana would be undesirable besides its legal status. Smoking constitutes a fire hazard, and the smell of the smoke spreads throughout hallways. However, these minor inconveniences hardly justify legal action. Though the law still applies on campus, the University should not blindly abide by an unfair policy, especially as states throughout the nation are starting to overturn it. Dissent The Editorial Board validly observes a “punishment differential” according to University regulations between disciplines in cases of alcohol use and those of marijuana use not reflective of the disparity in health risks between the two substances.  Yet the majority comes to a peculiar conclusion.  If the ill effects of alcohol are indeed more serious than those of marijuana, why suggest similar leniency in discipline for marijuana use instead of proposing that alcohol be treated more seriously? It is curious to decry the current “inequity” and propose another in its stead. If the University were to alter its policy based on the “welfare of the students as well as scientific fact,” it would make alcohol infractions more serious than those for marijuana. We agree with the Board’s recognition that the law applies on campus; so why not follow it? As inconvenient as it might be for our social lives, the law does restrict the usage of these potentially harmful substances. If a student deems the risk worthwhile, he or she is free to act as his or her prudence dictates but with full knowledge of possible legal consequences. It is in the best interest of the University, if it is to serve any nation, to promote among its students a respect for the legitimate laws of the land as long as they are in effect. That two of the 50 states (neither of which is New Jersey) have recently legalized marijuana is not grounds for a change in University policy.|~|Signed by Sergio Leos ’17 and Zach Horton ’15  
55981|~|Asian-American identity: The Princeton perspective|~|   February 16 2014|~|Column | Feb. 16 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Andrew Hahm  In 2012, the Pew Research Center published a report on Asian-American demographic trends, proclaiming that “Asian Americans are the highest-income, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the United States.” The report, entitled “The Rise of Asian Americans,” points to an incredible growth in the visibility of the Asian-American community in recent years. More Asian-American politicians across the political spectrum, from Republican Nikki Haley in South Carolina to Democrat Grace Meng in New York to socialist Kshama Sawant in Seattle, have been elected to public office than ever before. Culturally, Asian-Americans have been finding a greater voice in film, comedy, music and literature, through both traditional media and new online platforms. Asian-American commentators such as Amy Chua and Wesley Yang have been garnering national attention for their views on what Asian America entails. Yet, as the supposed spotlight shines on the Asian-American community, it also uncovers a latent uncertainty and debate over what it means to be an Asian-American. Historically, Asian-American identity has fluctuated with the greater state of race relations in America. For example, Asian-American stereotypes have changed erratically over the years. At one extreme Asian-Americans are unassimilable, hypersexualized and economically-threatening. At another, they are the emasculated and docile “model minority”. The ethnic groups that constitute Asian America are unclear and oft misidentified as well. Just last year, reports showed that officers of the New York Police Department were identifying Indian-Americans as “American Indians” in their police reports. Sikh Americans have been targeted in anti-Islam hate crimes following 9/11, while Chinese-American Vincent Chin was beaten to death in Detroit by laid-off white autoworkers who held deep resentments against Japanese automakers. What, then, makes one Asian-American? A recent survey conducted by Princeton’s Asian American Students Association may shed some light on the matter. The six-question email survey was sent to the University undergraduate population to determine how Princeton students perceived the Asian-American community. The survey asked respondents to rank the similarities among Asian-Americans in five different categories on a scale of one to seven. The final question asked respondents to select on a map the regions of Eurasia from which Asian-Americans may have ancestry. As to the latter question, almost all respondents believed that people of East Asian descent were Asian-American. However, around one-third of respondents did not believe that people of South Asian descent were Asian-American. Generally, the further west on the Asian continent the region was, the fewer people there were who claimed that a person with ancestry from the region could be considered Asian-American. In a way, this data seems to be indicative of the same mindset that caused the NYPD confusion when categorizing Americans of Indian heritage. The responses for the questions ranking similarity among Asian-Americans tended to indicate that Asian-Americans were “very different” from each other, pointing to the Princeton community’s view that Asian-Americans had little in common historically, economically and politically. Answers to the free-response question asking respondents to define Asian-Americans reflect this desire among Princeton students to be as accurate as possible in defining racial categories: some wrote apologetically of “straight black hair, small eyes, pale skin,” while others explained how “problematic [it is] to lump people into massive ethnic groups.” This survey could, perhaps, be representative of a greater liberal trend in America against stereotyping and sweeping generalizations. At the same time, it is crucial to acknowledge both the similarities that Asian-Americans share and the legacy that the term “Asian-American” carries. It would be misleading to say that Asian-Americans share no common narrative. Asian-American immigration patterns have been affected in similar ways by overgeneralized American immigration policy in the past two centuries, and the majority of Asian-Americans of all ethnic groups tend to vote for the Democratic Party. It would also be inappropriate to conclude from the heterogeneity of the Asian-American population that Asian-Americans of different ethnic groups should dissociate from each other. For instance, academics such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak write of a “strategic essentialism” to a unified identity, necessary particularly for the political gains Asian-Americans seek. In other words, it is important to recognize the power of identity politics and its importance in achieving representation for all Asian-Americans. Although this survey revealed disagreements on what constitutes Asian America, it will hopefully spur an open dialogue about Asian-American identity beyond mindless stereotypes. The hegemonically imposed Asian-American identity is one that still has currency in society today. It is necessary to confront the problems it poses, not ignore them. Such a dialogue will help the Asian-American community to better identify and fight for shared interests while celebrating acknowledged differences. Princeton is ahead of the curve in its view of Asian America, but in an institution in which one in five students identify as Asian-American, this is not enough. A coherent identity is needed, and that begins with conversations on our campus.|~|Andrew Hahm is a freshman from Ramsey, N.J. He is a member of the AASA Asian American Studies Committee.

55738|~|Students first, staffers second|~|   February 13 2014|~|Column | Feb. 13 |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|Newspapers fulfill a unique niche in whatever community they serve, whether that is the campus, city, nation or the world at large, as they are one of the few sources providing concise and clear factual information in the time honored objective of traditional journalists. This exclusive role is especially prevalent on college campuses, where the only other source of information about campus issues is the University itself and thus could be biased. In addition to providing campus news, these university newspapers grant those students involved with the paper an incredible opportunity to serve the student body and hone professional skills. The Opinion section of The Daily Princetonian provides a forum for columnists and the general University community to enact changes by publicizing pertinent issues, especially when traditional media aimed at creating change fail, which is why I choose to join the section. (And given that applications are now out for second semester columnists, it is something you too can do if you also want a forum to generate change.) However, the student newspaper system here isn’t flawless. The new editor-in-chief recently published the ‘Prince’ code of ethics, in alignment with the policy of most newspapers, to render the newspaper more accountable to the campus population. Laudably, the code of ethics emphasizes that staffers are professionals and should be held “to the highest levels of ethical conduct and integrity.” The goal of maintaining a professional atmosphere is admirable, as it serves both the writers looking for a real-world experience and the readers who want reliable information. Nevertheless, the reality that we are students first, not journalists, makes me question some policies within the code of ethics, policies that if modified slightly wouldn’t diminish the reading experience for our audience, but would enhance the experience for the many student journalists who work for the ‘Prince.’ Specifically, I question the policy that writers for the Opinion section and those students involved in the business of publishing the newspaper cannot be part of any other section. The rationale is that Opinion columnists have publicly displayed biases in their columns whereas every other section — from News to Copy to Design — is publicly unbiased. Thus, even if an Opinion writer can be unbiased in another role, the mere “appearance” of bias prohibits a crossover role to another section. The problem is, it is irrational to assume that the opinion columnist is any more biased than the average copy editor, designer or editor who also has some control over page layout. Everyone has a perspective that can bias how they copy edit an article or how they choose to lay out the articles. It is naïve to assume otherwise. Thus, the notion that the bias doesn’t matter — while the mere the appearance of a bias is important — is ridiculous. The primary rationale behind preventing this section crossover might be that this appearance of bias would ruin the newspaper’s reputation and credibility to its readers. But if this is actually a nonissue to the reasonable reader, the separation doesn’t seem legitimate. Staffers when writing, editing or laying out the news should all be held to a high standard of objectivity. An Opinion columnist is not any less likely than any other newspaper staffer to be objective in dealing with news articles. It might be true that in some cases the likelihood of introducing bias into a role is so large that it merits this separation. For example, it might be reasonable to assume that news and opinion writers shouldn’t cross over. But surely Copy and Design face fewer situations in which bias would intervene. It is naïve to assume that a sports writer will not copy edit in a slightly biased way like an opinion writer might be inclined to do, as they are both students with varied perspectives. Furthermore, these restrictions also apply to guest columnists who only wrote one opinion column, even without their realization. No matter what section one chooses, being a student journalist comes with its sacrifices, as a newspaper is nothing without its reputation for objectivity. I myself was accepted to both News and Opinion this past fall and decided to join Opinion largely because I felt the restrictions on news staffers were so intrusive that they would hinder my ability to have the well-rounded student experience. According to the code of ethics, news writers and even sports reporters cannot even sign a USG candidate’s petition to run — merely a statement that you support the candidate having the opportunity to run — much less publicly support a USG candidate. Though I understand that some sacrifices are necessary as a journalist, I didn’t feel that these were fair, as they take the goal of avoiding the appearance of bias too far. The ‘Prince’ should strive to attain the highest ethical standards in order to maintain its reputation and fulfill its duty to the community. The publication of the code of ethics is proof that this year’s editorial board is off to a great start. Yet we must also recognize that the ‘Prince’ is a student newspaper and still has a responsibility to provide a well-rounded apprenticeship experience to its student journalists.|~|
55718|~|Picking classes|~|   February 13 2014|~|Column | |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|Senior year brings an amalgam of intense feelings, confusions and apprehensions. It is a year of transition where independent work becomes significantly more serious and the prospect of leaving the academy for the first time is daunting. These fears and anxieties are normal, unavoidable and important to moving on — natural growing pains. One consistent and far more avoidable senior-concern is the pangs of regret associated with doubting class selection choices.  There are more than a thousand class options per semester — a student will take around 35 in his 8 semesters. It is impossible to play out in one’s mind what could have been. There are steps, however, that can be taken to minimize this sense of doubt, and ensure that one is confident in one’s choices. The most important and perhaps overstated item of advice given is that the quality of a professor makes or breaks a class. The degree to which this is true makes it worth taking a class by a stellar professor, even in a subject only moderately interesting. Knowing which professors fit this bill is discovered by reputation and consultation with other professors who themselves wish they could audit their colleagues classes. Also, course reviews and Youtube clips of previous classes can be useful tools. For example, in my experience taking Caryl Emerson’s COM 415: Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace, and the Tasks of Literature is less about understanding Tolstoy than it is about learning how to approach an author from Caryl Emerson. If a student exposes herself to the great minds living at this institution she can better access the dead ones codified in the pages of our texts. In order to take full advantage of the tremendous professors available at the University, it is also important to balance the type of work one takes on in a given semester. Even in a world where a student chooses all the “right” classes, one cannot extract all the wisdom available if there is an imbalance in class work requirements. Too many essays and an 80 page Dean’s Date or too many problem sets and back-to-back-to-back finals doesn’t allow a student to maximize his attention allocation. A little planning allows for a healthy mixture. In balancing different types of course work, one also encourages well-roundedness. Interesting people can and should participate in many forms of cultural and scientific literacy. It is of course important to be passionate about something and achieve a level of expertise, but that should not come at the cost of exposure to diverse disciplines. The most stimulating people are computer science majors who understand biblical allusions in literature, or comparative literature majors who have confronted questions of impending computer singularity (the point at which computers surpass human intelligence). It is important to build the ability to approach life with the varied tools necessary. Taking liberal arts seriously also allows students to continue studying interesting things on their own, after their formal schooling has concluded. Amassing analytic tools also allows for one to grow into new interests. We are constantly becoming aware of new interesting intellectual pursuits. We can indulge these curiosities thoroughly if we expose ourselves to different modes of thinking. Simultaneously important to acquiring a varied set of analytic tools is also developing functional skills necessary to be an asset in a “real-world” working environment. Many work skills can be learned quickly and on the spot, while others require the careful guidance of a professor. A robust statistics course is important for many jobs, and while statistics is seldom anyone’s favorite class, it is undeniably helpful and not taking it could be a source of eventual regret. Ultimately, I believe it is important to not get bogged down in the future. Selecting courses to check boxes of what one ought to know for a potential job is a major source of regret. So too is treating the course title numbers as existing in a progression — as in one should take a 300-level course only after having done a 200-level version. These numbers should mostly be viewed as easing cataloguing for the office of the registrar. The titles of courses is important — the corresponding digits are not. Choosing classes is about a little research, a little intuition, a little luck and little disregard for what one “ought to do.”|~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif.

55707|~|Let yourself go (abroad)|~|   February 13 2014|~|Column | Feb. 13 |~|Chelsea Jones|~|None|~|In imagining what can only be the dramatic origins of a certain Princeton mantra, I like to think that one day a Princetonian on the cusp of graduation looked up at Blair Arch, its stones basked in a special sort of afternoon sun, and in a fit of nostalgia placed his hand on the shoulder of a passing freshman and warned, “You only get eight semesters here.” The freshman then thought of the very short eight semesters ahead of him and was struck with unease. He repeated the words, now with the cadence of a proverb, to those around him: “You only get eight semesters here.” And the phrase was picked up and passed on and was swept up into the collective consciousness of the Princeton student so that however many years later as I, a restless sophomore, filled out my application to study abroad the following fall it made me wonder if I was making a terrible mistake. Anyone who disproved of my going, or who did not want to go themselves, said those string of words as if no other advice was necessary. Why would I want to give up one of my precious eight semesters? Until the moment I landed at Heathrow Airport in London, I was wondering the same thing. I was afraid that I would miss some quintessential Princeton moment. I absolutely needed to live out all eight semesters on this campus, within these gates, to really get the “college experience” that adults always seem to reference, as if we’ve all had the same one. I feared missing my friends, the nights out, the inside jokes that I wouldn’t be a part of when I returned. I worried about the academic and career opportunities — classes rarely offered or information sessions for future internships — that would pass by while I was gone. And I did, in fact, miss some things while I was abroad. I missed the break up of three couples and the start of one other. I was not here for Princetoween or formals or the bonfire. Four good friends threw various birthday pregames I could not attend and I never networked at the Morgan Stanley information session. I was not here at the moment when others got over the novelty of eating in a club and I will have to wait until next fall to take THR 205: Introductory Playwriting. So, yes, I missed things. But the important things — my friends, my extracurriculars, my professors, even my unsolved problems — were all waiting, untouched and unchanged, when I came back. In the end, I missed a semester that was not all that different from the others. After a semester abroad, the mantra I’m professing is, “You have seven semesters at Princeton. And only one abroad. Why would you not go?”  Never in your life will you have the opportunity, flexibility and the financial assistance to spend three or four or five months in a different country and actually be expected, even encouraged, to expend energy enjoying yourself. I explored London and cities throughout Europe  and found hidden — and not so hidden — places to love in each of them. I met incredible people to get lost with, to laugh with and even to cry with once or twice. I had one of those cliché coming of age moments when some sound perspective — on what matters and what makes me happy — replaced, in retrospect, a rather naïve one. I love that it happened and hate that I have no less corny way to say it — I had the time of my not-so-long life. I would readily give up another semester to do it all again. Do not let anyone — even yourself — talk you out of going abroad if that is what you want to do. This is your chance and it pains me to hear students say, “I want to go abroad but … ” There are very few endings to that sentence that should be enough for you to stay. I promise Princeton will be here, FitzRandolph gates still thrown open, when you return. And in a way it will all seem more wonderful — the campus more beautiful than you remembered, the relative familiarity of the faces more comforting, the Street not so mundane, the free laundry more luxurious. Nevertheless, I am not so ignorant as to suggest that every single person should or must go abroad. There are those that simply have no desire and to them I say do enjoy each and every moment of your time here — Princeton can be its own sort of adventure if you take risks and seize opportunities within its bounds. But if for even a moment you considered going abroad, do not let any excuse dissuade you. In the scheme of things, missing a semester was a blink, a snap, a twitch — I was there and then suddenly I was back. That is the opportunity I encourage you to grasp, because it is fleeting and brilliant and there is only one, not eight, of these chances before you.|~|Chelsea Jones is an English major from Ridgefield, Conn.

55545|~|The basic necessities|~|   February 12 2014|~|Column | Feb. 12 |~|Katherine Zhao|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Over intersession, I spent three days in the living room of a cozy barn house on a retreat with the Princeton’s Women’s Mentorship Program. Sixteen Princeton women got on a bus to Chauncey Conference Center ten minutes away from the University, with the purpose of going outside the Orange Bubble and discussing and reflecting on issues important to us. The leadership team of the Women’s Mentorship Program noted that the goal of the intercession retreat “was to create a safe space for women to reflect upon their time at Princeton thus far and development as women leaders.” Tara Woodard-Lehman, the Presbyterian chaplain, facilitated the discussions and activities, creating a feeling of camaraderie among the women, sitting in a circle on the floor. But the retreat was not limited to a closed discussion: outside speakers came in and spoke to us about issues such as mindful eating, and the dangers of “effortless perfection.” We were made to understand the basic necessities that we had begun to neglect due to the stresses of school and other activities. Dr. Robin Boudette from the University Health Center spoke to us about mindful eating, beginning by asking us survey questions such as “Do you eat out of habit or choice?” and “Do you eat for reasons other than nutrition?” My own answers to the survey surprised me; I realized that I had been pushing aside the basic necessities that my body required, attending instead to the pressing matters of the day. Many of us reported eating food mindlessly, whether it was forcing down a granola bar or yogurt on the way to class. We hurriedly finish lunch while completing our class readings. And when we focus so much on getting through the grind of everyday life, we sacrifice the little things that are important to our health, like mindful eating. We fail to acknowledge the fact that meeting the needs of our bodies and keeping ourselves healthy is just as important as maintaining our grades or extracurricular responsibilities. These little things are something I feel everyone on campus should keep in mind. Students at Princeton seem to put on an air of being effortlessly perfect, in looks, grades, and social activities. Dr. Alexis Andres, another retreat presenter and the Butler College Director of Student Life, told us about a student who went so far as to hide in the library to study, so his roommate wouldn’t see him studying. The danger comes when everyone pretends to be perfect, that the act becomes too real, and students begin to believe that they are inferior, when they themselves are each contributors to the problem. At the retreat, we sat in a circle, shared our stories and vulnerabilities, and healed the bruises to our self-esteem that the creeping pestilence of effortless perfection had caused. My takeaway from the retreat — and what I want to share with the rest of the Princeton community — is to realize that nobody’s life is as perfect as it may seem. When we sat in a circle and shared our stories, we learned that everyone experienced difficulties and, that behind the perfectly constructed façade of a polished Princeton student, there is a fellow human being struggling with all the struggles that come with growing up. The first time we introduced ourselves on this trip we also told the group why we chose to attend. The reason that consistently came up was reflection. This experience was an opportunity to take a break from the rushed life at Princeton during the semester, and to think about each other not as competitors, but as friends and mentors. As Carolyn Yang, copresident of the Women’s Mentorship Program said, “There is something extraordinarily powerful about women coming together and bonding over self-discovery and shared experiences outside of their immediate friend circles and campus affiliations.” And I agree. It was an experience that allowed me to empathize and share stories with a circle of women, and reminded me of basic necessities that many Princeton students, too caught up in getting ahead, forget.|~|Katherine Zhao is a freshman from East Brunswick, N.J.

55503|~|The role that rivalries play|~|   February 12 2014|~|Column | Feb. 12 |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|My brother recently sent me a photo of a bathroom stall at his school, the University of California at Berkeley, and over the toilet seat dispenser, someone had attached a sign that read “Stanford diplomas, take one.” Naturally, I was tempted to replicate the idea at Princeton, replacing the school name of Stanford with the name Harvard, of course. Yet at the same time, I questioned the ultimate role that rivalries play in academia. Some of the more famous ones, of course, include the intra-Ivy League triumvirate of Harvard, Princeton and Yale, but there is also the UC Berkeley — Stanford face-off (next time you have the chance, visit stanfordrejects.com), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill – Duke University, University of California at Los Angeles — University of Southern California, Boston College – University of Notre Dame, University of Arizona – Arizona State University and countless others. The rivalries, understandably, most often hinge on sports, and as long as they stay confined to the field, they can be good fun between neighboring or distant universities. However, when taken too far, rivalries can have demoralizing effects on the overall student population and in extreme cases can incite violence or else intense animosity. At USC and UCLA for instance, students will organize squads to camp out in front of their two statues — Tommy Trojan and the UCLA bear, respectively — in order to ensure that no one from the opposite school has the opportunity to vandalize the mascots, particularly around game days. And at Princeton, the cannon buried in Cannon Green was the prize in a veritable game of tug-of-war between Princeton and Rutgers during the mid-1800s — it was finally implanted indelibly in the center of campus within a block of concrete to prevent any further thefts and counter thefts in 1875. Of course, those students have the right to spend their time as they wish, but it does come across as a waste — students choose to spend their time acting as vigilantes working to prevent vandalism. This vandalism, besides being illegal, is just downright disrespectful and costly to the damaged school. Even worse than expending huge amounts of energy and inciting unnecessary tension, though, are cases in which students physically seek to injure students of opposite schools, whether athletes or fans. As far back as Roman times, riots would often erupt over the results of chariot races. More recently, in 1972 at a basketball game between Ohio State University and the University of Minnesota, an Ohio State player was violently assaulted on the field when an opposing player punched him in the face and kicked him. Then, another player stepped on his head. What’s more, rivalries, when taken too far, only harm the schools’ own images, portraying the schools’ students as people who are aggressive, sore losers and perhaps even a tad unstable — after all, who in their right mind would beat up an opposing player because of the urge to win a rivalry? As college students at reputable higher education institutions, it is our responsibility, and indeed our obligation, to hold ourselves to higher standards — the standards of our school. The question then becomes: To what ends do such rivalries serve? After all, at their base, rivalries stem innately from a sense of competition or a need to compare ourselves with others. Hence, the school that we compare ourselves to effectively becomes a metric against which we measure ourselves. In this way, such comparisons affirm our prowess relative to others and thus elevates others to the standing that we have or higher — since a comparison is tantamount to saying that we can be “as good” as someone else. Rivalries have the potential to help bind together different institutions by introducing a common point of interest. Yet when taken too far, rivalries become sources of hatred and resentment and can even precipitate malevolent behavior or conflict. School pride is admirable, but rivalries should only be a source of camaraderie between peers — not a source of contention that breeds hate or fosters the need to feel better about ourselves at the expense of others nor a source of constant comparison in which competitors are reduced to perpetually one-upping each other.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

55514|~|The social effects of recruitment|~|   February 12 2014|~|Column | Feb. 12 |~|Rebecca Kreutter|~|None|~|If I told you I’m on a varsity team, you could probably guess that I spend almost equal amounts of time in class and in practice or that I stress more over big races than big exams. You might assume that my closest friends are on my team, that we attack the dining hall as a herd, that I meet up with them to study, go out with them on the weekends, maybe, even, that I room with them. If I added I rowed, you might assume I am in Cloister Inn, that I spend far too much time in spandex and that when my special rower beacon hones in on another of my kind I quickly devolve into minutiae about boats, ergs and technique. You would be right. I am, in many ways, a stereotypical athlete. I didn’t plan to be. I didn’t even expect to be. Before I arrived, I had never picked up an oar, let alone considered the most efficient way to propel eight other people through the water with one. Not that I regret joining the team, far from it. Being a non-recruited athlete has, however, given me the opportunity to observe what it means to be an athlete at Princeton from a middle ground, with one eye towards the non-athletic life I might have led and one to the recruited life of so many of my closest friends. A lot has already been said about the relative merits and detriments of recruiting athletes, in particular the potential effects on academics for non-athlete Princetonians. What interests me, instead, is the social effect that recruitment has on the athletes who become Tigers. Before walking on to the crew team, I had never considered that the opportunity of being recruited would be anything more than a relief in the crapshoot that is the admission process. I never considered how much it limits. When a non-athlete decides which college to go to, the choice comes down to some mix of academics, extracurriculars, location, size and the ever-vague “campus feel.” When athletes are recruited, they buy into not only a college but also a community. They arrive on campus with a set of built-in friends and a place to go everyday to get away from the daily grind of schoolwork. It sounds great and, more often than not, teams do become close from spending so much time together. I’m left wondering what happens when someone feels like they don’t fit into the team culture. While non-athletes can naturally self-select into friend groups over the course of freshman year, athletes run the risk of committing to four years spent with non-compatible personalities. It is not that athletes can’t, or don’t, make friends outside of their sport, but an athlete’s schedule makes it all too easy to restrict one’s circle to one’s team.  I’ve seen teammates end up in tears when it becomes too taxing to spend hours every day with the same few people, particularly if they may all be competing for the same spots on the top squad. I’ve seen teams turn on one particular member and heard athletes who spend most of their time bickering about each other. I don’t pretend to know the dynamics of every or any team on campus, and I don’t deny that non-athlete groups of friends have their moments too. What I do know is that I’ve always told myself if I didn’t like the environment on my team, I would walk away. Many recruited athletes don’t feel they are free to make that decision. I’ve had several athletes tell me, almost guiltily, that they wouldn’t have been accepted to Princeton if not for playing a sport. Others confess they don’t enjoy the sport anymore but feel as if they owe four years to the team. Being recruited comes with the understanding that although college is a time to try new things, practice comes first. Rare is it to find an athlete who does more than two or three extracurriculars. What happens if athletes decide to quit? There is no part-time varsity athlete, no way to cut back hours or lighten the load. With the sport goes the community. It is rarely a function of meanness so much as fixed schedules. Out of sight, out of mind. Those who remain too easily forget that our team used to have more people. I hope that I am wrong, that I am reading too much into a situation with which I am not personally familiar. For many recruited athletes, the built-in social group of a team creates some amazing friendships. I fear that some end up doubting, instead, their place on the team that once actively recruited them to join their community.|~|Rebecca Kreutter is a Wilson School major from Singapore, Singapore.

55359|~|Zombies|~|   February 11 2014|~|Column | Feb. 11 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“It occurred to me why they call it eye contact.” Hazel, the protagonist of John Green’s novel The Fault in Our Stars, aptly notes that more than one of our five senses is at play when two pairs of eyes meet. Through eye contact, we not only connect visually, but we also touch — figuratively, perhaps, but also in the most physical, literal sense of the word. It is fitting, then, that deliberate eye contact is often touted as an effective tool of communication and speech. It is commonly known that eye contact conveys confidence and sincerity. We connect not only through verbal communication, but also through physical unity. And Princeton students are great at utilizing this tool to exude confidence and demonstrate active participation in precepts, during presentations and even in large lectures. There is, however, a different kind of eye contact, a kind that is not consciously initiated but rather a natural consequence of sharing an environment with other people. Outside of the classroom, we view this kind of eye contact as an undesirable accident we instinctively seek to rectify. We flit our gaze somewhere else. Even with people we know, eye contact of this form seems uncomfortable. I can’t count the number of times I’ve unintentionally made eye contact with a fellow classmate in precept, only to hastily glance away when I notice his gaze returning my own. This has happened in pathways, in Frist Campus Center, in the dining halls, in exam rooms for other courses and even in the hallway of my dorm, which I share with members of my advisee group. This may say something about the nature of student life at an academic institution like Princeton. The awkwardness of eye contact is universal. Yet, as Lea Trusty wrote in her column last April, there is something uniquely distancing about the avoidance of eye contact here at Princeton. As she says, we are incredibly focused on the endless sources of stress that abound for any college student: academics, social life and our plans for the future. Students seem distant because they’re closed in, too focused on their future to invest in the now. We contribute to this lonely distance by averting our eyes rather than looking up as we go about our day. However, I believe the discomfort we associate with eye contact speaks to a broader phenomenon that goes beyond the idiosyncrasies of Princeton life. It’s not just that students here are too caught up in themselves to engage with others around them: It is that they are afraid to. Modern society has stigmatized curiosity — the kind that leads an unrestrained child to stare unabashedly at whomever or whatever he finds interesting — in the name of preserving personal space and political correctness. We have become jaded; it is no longer friendly, but instead creepy, to lock eyes with someone you don’t know or don’t know well. So, we have resorted to constantly looking away, lest we accidentally offend. Eye contact, a natural and inevitable part of making our way around campus, now carries the risk of accidentally upsetting someone or coming across as suspicious or  judgmental. Keeping our heads down is a way of saving face. Despite common beliefs that attempt to explain this trend, I think Princetonians are less self-oriented than they are often portrayed to be. We are invested in our relationships with those immediately around us. Many of us care greatly about how we present ourselves and where we stand within the community. And in a campus where competition and hierarchy seem to stretch into every aspect of life, we’re trained to act as though we feel integrated and at ease with ourselves, even when we are not, because others seem to be doing the same. It may very well be the case that students appear too engrossed in their own lives because that’s exactly how they want to appear. We don’t look away because we have more important things to think about than the familiar faces we encounter. We look away because we’re afraid others will do so first. We fear not being acknowledged reciprocally or not being  memorable enough during a brief encounter. We don’t want to be perceived as creepy or overly interested. So, instead of looking up and acknowledging our peers, we gaze into the distance like zombies with a singular focus, secretly fearful.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan. She can be reached at ljkim@princeton.edu. 
55334|~|Surprisingly mild reaction to NSA surveillance|~|   February 11 2014|~|Column | Feb. 11 |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|One of the legacies 2013 will leave behind, as Andrea Peterson wrote recently in The Washington Post, is that it was “the year that proved your paranoid friend right.” Since January of last year, we’ve learned that the National Security Agency is collecting massive amounts of phone call metadata, emails, location information of cell phones and is even listening to Xbox Live. Shocking as this obviously was to me, as a citizen of the country of “We the People,” one founded on civil liberties, what was perhaps more shocking was how mild the reaction of many Americans was. While polls showed that a small majority of U.S. citizens opposed the NSA’s collection of phone and Internet usage data, after months of reassurances by the President that the programs would be reformed and used responsibly, the numbers seem to have changed (or at least, the story seems to be dying down). The problem here is that a story like this shouldn’t ever go away, not until the sought reforms are accomplished or at least until we as a society reach an informed consensus about the core issues at stake. Every day that we wait, every day that such programs are allowed to continue without public scrutiny or reform, is a day in which rights are unduly sacrificed without the informed consent of the public. Personally, I wouldn’t have found it as bad if these programs had existed in public. If there had been a public debate about their existence and a democratic way by which the NSA was given such authority over us, it could have been at least easier to swallow. What bothers me most about the whole NSA story is that, without Snowden and his large, repeated leaks to the press, we would never have known that all this is going on. The government never planned on telling anyone, and it was the intention of the administration to keep these programs completely secret from the American people, presumably forever. They were designed, on paper and in practice, to be secret programs run by a secretive organization with no transparency. The programs were approved by a secret court that represents only one side, has no way of independently verifying what that one side says, keeps decisions secret and only rejects .3 percent of all program proposals (although many requests are modified before being approved). That, almost more than the programs themselves, is what scares me. As Americans, we have a right to know, on a general level that doesn’t compromise operational security, what the government of the people is doing. I absolutely don’t need to know the names of the terrorists being targeted or the locations being monitored, but I have the right to know that the government is doing such things. Nothing is more important to a democracy than a well-informed citizenry, as Jefferson once said, and transparency is the most basic foundation of that ideal. Furthermore, once the cat was out of the bag, a series of lines was drawn in the sand. The NSA wasn’t paying attention to domestic calls or to Americans, we were told; the programs were limited in their application only to our enemies, not our allies; the government wasn’t listening to anyone’s phone, just getting metadata. But time and again, as if like clockwork, each and every one of these arbitrarily defined lines was crossed. We found out not only that the NSA was not only getting domestic phone call metadata but that it was also doing so for hundreds of millions of us. We found out that cell phone information was being batch-collected on hundreds of millions of people in the European Union. We found out that not only was the NSA listening to some phone calls abroad, but it was also listening to the Chancellor of Germany’s personal cell phone. Every time we were promised that this new revelation or that was the final one, that each new boundary was the real one they had meant all along, it was revealed to be a lie. Mutual trust between the republic and its citizens that is now so lacking is exactly what would be needed in excess for such programs to continue in the future. The biggest problem here, on a larger level than the existence of the NSA programs, is the lack of long-lasting, results-oriented debate over the merits and costs these programs have for our society. So if there’s one thing I’ll remember about 2013, it’s not only that the paranoid people were right but also that shockingly few of us cared.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

55325|~|Editorial: Increasing ROTC’s presence |~|   February 11 2014|~|Editorial | Feb. 11 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|In the fall of 1919, the Reserve Officers Training Corps was established at the University. Following on the heels of the “war to end all wars,” the new program struggled to gain enrollment, but, after a push by this very newspaper, The Daily Princetonian, and the University President, John Hibben, participation in ROTC surged. With the Vietnam War, however, student activists pressured the University into effectively banning ROTC from campus. Yet the ban was lifted within the year — well before other Ivy League universities followed suit. Army ROTC was swiftly reestablished in 1972. This past week, the University announced that Navy ROTC will finally return to campus next fall. We, the Board of the ‘Prince,’ once again support ROTC at Princeton and so laud the recent decision. Nevertheless, ROTC programs at Princeton could be better integrated with the University: First, by granting University course credit for ROTC classes, and second, by permitting non-ROTC University students to take those classes. Participating in ROTC at Princeton is a major time commitment. Unlike participation in a varsity sport, ROTC entails not only physical training but also coursework. All ROTC cadets must take Military Science and Leadership courses that, at present, bear no University course credit. This can prove challenging for cadets to balance these courses with the weight of ordinary classes and other extracurricular involvement. The simple and sensible solution would be to return University course credit to ROTC classes (as had been the case prior to 1969), assuming, of course, that University faculty deems the courses sufficiently rigorous as to warrant it. According to Lieutenant Colonel Peter Knight, director of the army officer education program, the University administration has been receptive to the idea of reinstating course credit, so long as there is a “support network for such courses” to ensure continuity; that is, the ROTC officials would teach the courses in conjunction with permanent Princeton faculty members. Such integration would maintain the consistency and rigor of these Military Science and Leadership courses over time so that the University could grant course credit. This would help ease the current burden on ROTC cadets. With official University course credit and instruction by permanent Princeton faculty, there would be no reason to exclude other non-ROTC Princeton students from enrolling in these classes; indeed, there is good reason for other students to consider taking them. Many Princeton students go on to serve the nation in policy-making capacities that have direct effects on the military (e.g., working in the Department of Defense). For this reason, students hoping to serve in such ways would do well to be educated about the American military establishment. Opening ROTC courses to ordinary Princeton students would further these ends. The University should encourage students seeking to offer their service to the nation by doing what it can to facilitate their education. Closer cooperation between ROTC and the University would make participation in ROTC more manageable and would allow non-ROTC students to become more familiar with our nation’s military. Indeed, the return of Navy ROTC to Princeton aligns well with the University’s unofficial motto: “Princeton in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations.” Knight put it better than we ever could: “At Princeton University, whose students dedicate themselves in a multitude of capacities ‘in the nation’s service, in the service of all nations,’ those students who seek to serve in the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force or Coast Guard do so by choice for a noble cause and not simply for a scholarship. At the end of the day, the people who are in ROTC are there because they want to be. Those are the kind of people we want. Here at Princeton, I am willing to bet that we have a healthy number of people who seek to contribute in some way to the noble calling to which we answer. Those students deserve to choose which branch of the Armed Forces they want to serve in and do so in a way in which they best serve our nation and the free world. I welcome our sister services back to Princeton and view this development as one that will greatly benefit Princeton University, our nation and, ultimately, the world.”  |~|
55107|~|Taking a course in experience|~|   February 10 2014|~|Column | Feb. 10 |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|During my internship at an HIV/AIDS research center in South Africa, a clinician recalled to me one of her earliest experiences with an HIV patient from a township in the Western Cape. The patient was a middle-aged woman who worked during the day and, when her children came home, took care of them and her husband. She was a provider, a mother and a wife — an entire support system within one individual. This woman had already completed a significant portion of the HIV treatment by the time she spoke to the clinician. However, during this particular meeting, the patient said quite simply that she wasn’t going to come back to finish the rest of the treatment. The clinician couldn’t understand it. Frankly, neither could I. Coming from a science and health background academically, I had learned about disparities in health care, health education and medicine among different regions around the world. I had learned for so long what made these societies different from the “privileged” lifestyle with which I had grown up; I consequently judged all of those communities for not jumping at a resource once it was finally made available to them. I was very wrong. In guest contributor Kyle Berlin’s Feb. 2 column, “Service is a bit like faith,” he masterfully navigated the institution of service by Princeton students in community development projects around the world, highlighting the sins behind the “savior syndrome” and the superiority complex. He cited four common misconceptions about service that we should understand and reject in order to avoid reducing “the dignity and autonomy and capability of those accepting help.” I applaud him for pointing out the misguided and condescending aspects of service. However, as a corollary to Berlin’s acknowledgement of another culture’s differences, we should also recognize that these differences might not be as big as we think. Each person we encounter formulates a logical argument for why he does what he does, based on his own cultural circumstances. Just because that person has not had the opportunity to a formal education, does not mean that he has not had an education. That education could have come through personal experience, interaction with people in his community or discipline at home. To that person, making a decision using an experience-based education could make as much — or even more — sense as another person’s decision making based on a formal academic education. For example, after the meningitis B outbreak scare, 91 percent of the University community trekked to the clinic in Frist Campus Center to receive the first dose of the vaccination. During this time, health officials informed these participants that the second dose of the vaccination, which would be administered in February, was needed for maximum — if not for complete — protection against meningitis. However, despite this notification, many students on campus have said to me during my involvement in the vaccination campaign with the Student Health Advisory Board that they may or may not go to get the second dose. They cited reasons such as the myth that the second shot would hurt more than the first, that there has not been enough research and clinical testing done on the vaccine to ensure minimal risk of complications, that one shot could give minimal protection, which is “enough for their purposes” and the like. In fact, I was one of these students wavering over whether or not to get this necessary vaccination. I found myself listing reasons that were not based on personal scientific research, but rather hearsay, a fear of dealing with a sore arm and, perhaps, even a laziness to go all the way to Frist. Now, don’t I seem foolish for judging that patient from South Africa? She had once told the clinician that her immediate priority was to spend time laboring to provide for her family — to keep them alive with food in their stomachs and money to purchase the bare essentials. She would not come back for the final stage of her treatment because her focus rested in her family’s immediate survival. I have no idea what that responsibility is like, regardless of the books I’ve read, the films I’ve watched and the stories I’ve heard. In this situation, my formal education had prevented me from even listening to her argument — an argument that had endured in spite of witnessing people in her community dying of AIDS. Now think back to when I made trivial, illogical arguments for rejecting the second dose of a vaccination. How could I have admonished her for making the difficult choice to refuse treatment and access to a health clinic when I, as well as others, remain idle with my health care benefits, my undergraduate education in biology and physicians right in my backyard? When participating in “development work,” the criticisms and judgments we make in our own societies shouldn’t be projected on a community whose culture and ideology are different from our own. Because, while we’re so busy trying to explain to others how wrong they are, we often forget that it’s we who don’t understand.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.

55105|~|Pick you up? No, thanks|~|   February 10 2014|~|Column | Feb. 10 |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|Recently, I think I’ve finally come to terms with the exclusive nature of just about every part of this campus. I will always have reservations about the highly competitive, highly selective nature of the Princeton community. But I’ve convinced myself not to hate this quality so passionately anymore because I can’t hate this without hating Princeton itself. Princeton is filled with extremely talented people, so it is understandable that most people will be exceptional at something. However, nobody is exceptional at everything, and everybody learns that one way or another. Unfortunately, this difficult process is often exacerbated by the pervasive ritual of publicly announcing others’ success through pick-ups. Obviously, this came to mind amid the ever so relevant Bicker process that has engulfed the sophomore class over the past few weeks, but really this extends beyond just the eating clubs. In fact, I remember first contemplating this ritual my first few weeks on campus. As a naïve freshman who had just experienced a week of being told I was special and welcome in Princeton, I skipped merrily (OK, maybe just walked) through the aisles of the activities fair, blissfully imagining myself doing all of the wonderful things that everyone assured me I would need no experience to audition for. I landed on a cappella. I sang in musicals before, so, of course, I had a leg up on all of those non-experienced freshmen. After being rejected by multiple groups (I really shouldn’t say how many), I felt ashamed of thinking that I was talented enough to audition for such amazing groups. While I was admittedly naïve, the worst part by far was seeing what seemed like all of my hallmates being publicly and loudly accepted into their exclusive groups while I turned up my music and pretended not to care. What is the purpose of pick-ups? Is it to make new members feel welcome? There are plenty of ways that already exist to assimilate new members that don’t include such overtly public displays. The purpose is clearly to announce to outsiders the fact that these individuals have made it through the process. They have survived the rigors of selection and have been deemed worthy, and everyone must know about it. Ironically, some non-selective groups such as sign-in clubs have pick-ups, but this isn’t how this tradition started. Nobody cares if your next-door neighbor signed up for the chess club (actually, that too is probably highly selective at Princeton). I’m beginning to sound cynical — probably because I am. Everyone is entitled to be proud of his accomplishments, but at what point does celebration cross the line and become just plain rude? Unfortunately, real life isn’t so unequivocal, and no referee is going to throw a yellow flag at Ivy Club’s door for excessive celebration while the members parade around campus. However, there is a clear distinction between wearing that Princeton T-shirt you love and literally screaming as loud as possible to announce your accomplishments to the world. Granted, it’s not you who’s screaming. It’s the other members who are accepting you, but that’s just an excuse to justify an obnoxious and often hurtful ritual — not to mention that it is disruptive to everyone within a five-mile radius. Admittedly, I’m biased in many ways aside from being personally hurt by this process. As a rower, I have spent many years now in a sport that is unusually antiquated in the way that it handles success and failure. After a race, when you and your teammates lie in agony with burning muscles and blurred vision, you find a way to ease over to your opponent, win or lose, and squeeze out a breath to say “good race.” Not that sportsmanship is absent from other sports, but rather celebration is much more frowned upon, almost taboo, in this sport. This view of sportsmanship has found its way into most things I do in life because I try to remember that my own success often comes at the expense of other’s failures. While I may be cynical, I know that learning to deal with rejection is essential for coming to terms with yourself and feeling happy and fulfilled. Nobody can be great at everything, and most people find themselves falling short at some point in their life. But asking people to deal with rejection by shoving everyone else’s success in their face is insensitive and rude. This administration openly acknowledges a very prevalent sense of inferiority that most people experience when they come to the University (impostor syndrome and all that jazz). They have devoted a ton of resources to promote mental health and reassure the student body that, yes, you do belong here, even if it is hard to realize that sometimes. Yet, somehow nobody has thought to question how we obnoxiously praise talented individuals at the expense of those of us who have fallen short. Oh, you got into diSiac Dance Company? Congratulations! I am honestly happy for you, but a little humility would be appreciated.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pa. He can be reached at cjw5@princeton.edu. 
55163|~|The perfect class|~|   February 10 2014|~|Column | Feb. 10 |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|One of the psychology classes I took last semester had a reputation for being a pass/D/fail hotspot that caters to half-asleep seniors trying to get their last Social Analysis distribution requirement done before graduation. I can’t be sure, but I’d wager a guess that somewhere around 40 percent of the class took it P/D/F. In general, when taking a class P/D/F, it seems to be common courtesy to care the minimum amount. It’s the rational thing to, after all. If something toiled and sweated over gets you the same amount of credit as a shoddy, last-minute C-grade piece of work, why put in any more effort than you need to? Why not stick it to the man and artificially skew the grade deflation bell curve to help a (non-P/D/F-ing) brother out? The thing is, this way of thinking pervades the mindsets of almost everyone who elects to P/D/F a P/D/F-elective course, but never in the P/D/F-only courses that I’ve taken thus far. There are 10 people in my creative writing seminar, a class that you cannot take for a grade even if you wanted to. The class is technically P/D/F, but I think you’d be hard-pressed to find any professor in the Lewis Center for the Arts who’s ever given out an F, or worse — a D. Logic and precedent would dictate that these classes are populated with slackers — people handing in the bare minimum because there’s no tangible repercussion for doing so. Surprisingly, this was not the case. During the fourth week of classes, our creative writing class had an assignment due with a suggested page limit of two pages. The average page count of the submitted pieces was four. During our elevator rides down from the sixth floor of New South Building, our class often breaks the fourth wall and discusses the weird phenomenon. The class is never going to impact our GPAs, but for many of us, it’s the class we expend the most effort for. We submit revisions — often multiple revisions — though we’ve never been asked to. We send in pieces late, not out of laziness, but because we’d never send in something of poor quality. Better to be thought tardy than untalented. Of all the classes I’ve taken at Princeton, my creative writing class seems to be the ideal of what those glossy brochures advertised to me all those years ago. We’re working closely with a decorated and influential professor. Everyone cares deeply about the work they put into the class, beyond any sort of graded value. Despite the lack of numerical feedback, the dedication to improving and presenting the highest quality work never seems to waver. All classes at Princeton should be taught like the P/D/F-only classes offered by the Lewis Center. This is obviously not possible. There’s no way that all 400 students in ECO 100: Introduction to Microeconomics can feel as attended to as the 10 in my creative writing class. It took me a while to figure out what it is about P/D/F-only classes that creates that environment. It isn’t the P/D/F status, as P/D/F-elective classes have a very clearly opposite effect. Was it the application process that made sure that everyone in these classes was completely invested? Is it just the very nature of arts classes? Is it the fact that it’s a small seminar? This is possible; some of the most raved-about classes here are capped at 20 students or so. The ability to get to know a professor really well can make any class exponentially better. However, smaller classes still have grade deflation, and grading starts to become more subjective when a professor knows he must give out a certain number of Bs in his class of 12. The fact that creative writing is also P/D/F-only and also has an application process creates a sort of trifecta of the perfect possible conditions. More classes should be taught in this style than just arts classes. Small seminars that are P/D/F-only or at least don’t have a strict enforcement of grade deflation allow students to focus on the material rather than worry about their GPA. Application-only classes ensure that everyone in the class really wants to be there and fosters the same sort of environment that Princeton likes to boast about to eager-eyed high school seniors. And I know for a fact that when I talk to one of them as an alumni interviewer someday in some warm corner of a Starbucks, these will be the classes I wax poetic about.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

54998|~|Join the Editorial Board!|~|   February 9 2014|~|Editorial | Feb. 9 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Over the past semester, the unsigned editorials featured on this page have discussed issues such as the creation of a university bike share program, reforming distribution requirements to reflect the growing importance of big data and President Obama’s higher education reforms. The Daily Princetonian Editorial Board, a group of 14 undergraduates, was collectively responsible for writing these pieces. The members of the Board are not the editors of the various sections of the ‘Prince.’ Instead, they constitute an independent group of undergraduate students who are charged with determining the position of the newspaper as a whole. Today, instead of taking a stance on an issue, we would like to explain the editorial process and invite interested freshmen, sophomores and juniors to apply to join the Board. The Board is the independent body responsible for determining the position of the ‘Prince’ on a range of matters that affect Princeton, its campus community and our generation. We meet twice a week to discuss campus issues, solicit input from potential stakeholders and ultimately determine the stance the ‘Prince’ will take on the issue at hand. We work closely with other sections of the newspaper to gather information about editorial topics, but we deliberate behind closed doors and independently determine our own positions to preserve objectivity. The Board answers only to its chair, Jillian Wilkowski ’15; the executive editor for opinion, Sarah Schwartz ’15; and the editor-in-chief, Marcelo Rochabrun ’15. While the Board strives for unanimity, editorial positions are determined by majority vote and members take turns writing editorials. The majority opinion is signed collectively by the Editorial Board rather than the individuals who concurred with the position of the majority. The minority can also publish a dissent that will bear the names of the individuals dissenting when it is particularly passionate about the issue. All majority opinions are the collective product of the Board and constitute an independent voice separate from other sections of the ‘Prince.’ Crucial to our mission is the ability to incorporate a variety of diverse perspectives into the editorials we produce. Current Board members come from across the globe and represent a wide variety of majors, political philosophies and academic and extracurricular interests. What unites us is an engagement in campus life and a commitment to investigating and discussing issues that pertain to the University community. We are committed to bringing compelling arguments and perspectives to this page, criticizing and praising in equal measure. We try to recommend specific policies or actions for the University that, in our opinion, are best for the community as a whole. For us, its members, the Board is one of the defining activities of our time at Princeton. From the (relative) comfort of our fourth-floor conference room, we engage in challenging, passionate and intellectually-stimulating debates that lead us to examine and confront the full range of issues that affect our lives at Princeton. It is especially exciting when our suggestions make a lasting contribution to broader campus discussions about an issue or when the University adopts them, such as the computer science department’s decision to keep the pass/D/fail option available for COS 126 and the Honor Committee’s decision to modify its punishment for students who take extra time on tests. Our aim is to inspire discussion and, ultimately, action. But this is impossible without students with unique perspectives — independent thinkers who are eager to debate and willing to engage with issues important to Princeton. We value writing ability, creativity and strength of thought much more than journalistic experience. If you are interested in joining us, we encourage you to fill out our application by midnight on Sunday, Feb. 23. Applicants will be interviewed shortly thereafter. We look forward to meeting you!|~|
54911|~|A mental health network|~|   February 9 2014|~|Column | Feb. 9 |~|Lauren Davis|~|   Columnist     |~|Since I took a year off, I openly tell my friends that I struggle with anxiety and depression, and talk without shame about my regular sessions with a therapist. The number of people who have approached and opened up to me as a result is astounding. I’ve now heard countless tales of struggles with obsessive fears and mood swings; of mental health issues hidden from family and close friends who might not understand; of wanting help but feeling afraid, cautious or skeptical of the options offered by the University. I do my best to listen, to offer my own experiences and to advise with the limited skills I have picked up from my therapy sessions. But I’ve received no formal training and am far from equipped to offer them a long-term solution, as much as I wish I could. This is where Counseling and Psychological Services should come in, but for a variety of reasons I feel reluctant to refer anyone there except in the case of absolute emergency. Many have told me that they have been to CPS and found it unhelpful, dismissive or discouraging. This is not a good sign. I can’t speak for everyone, but what I’ve heard, combined with my own experiences with CPS, leaves me with a medium-to-poor view of the current system. To someone foreign to any kind of therapy, CPS is intimidating. To get an appointment requires a large amount of foresight and stressful scheduling. There is no system for booking continuous therapy sessions, as you cannot book more than a few weeks in advance, and thus it is hard to develop the kind of personal bond with a single therapist that is so vital to successful treatment. As I know from personal experience, the last thing you want to do when you are struggling mentally is to have to face administrative challenges and fears about whether or not you can even get an appointment, and to feel as though you are simply being temporarily patched up and then asked to leave after your 30 minutes are up. This is not to say that there aren’t dedicated, skilled and compassionate counselors working at CPS. The problem of students suffering and yet not getting help cannot be entirely blamed on the University as an institution. We can’t expect the University to foot the bill for every individual student’s psychotherapy. But an integrated approach, starting at the student body level, is desperately needed to help a campus full of high-achieving developing adults as they face some of the most turbulent times in their lives. So here is what I propose: a focus on creating a mental health network, beginning with mental health peer advisers (trained and carefully selected, following the SHARE model), who act as the bridge to the CPS counselors and services. Then CPS, clear in stating the extent and limitations of the services it offers, will do what it can before facilitating and encouraging referrals to full time clinicians in the area who can offer the kind of regular and focused attention that so many people here need. Perhaps some people currently utilize the Peer Health Advisers, or their residential college advisers as a resource, but these systems are either not promoted enough or do not have specific enough mental health-related goals. After three years at this school, I didn’t even know that the PHA program existed until a week ago. We need an organization which specifically trains students in basic psychological counseling techniques, and has at hand accessible student “counselors” who can listen to those who want help, talk through their concerns and then connect them with a true professional. A peer mental health group could help to personalize CPS, perhaps by connecting certain mental health peers with each individual CPS counselor, and creating a referral system. “Oh, go chat with Jean at CPS — she’s great and specializes in …” Mental health peers — familiar faces from classes or social settings, who by virtue of publicly acknowledging their experiences with mental health would begin to alleviate stigma — could be the missing link that allows people to feel comfortable and safe enough to admit that they are struggling, and to seek help in an informal and less intimidating way. At the same time, CPS could change to accommodate the needs of students by getting constant feedback from mental health peers about the most common needs and thus the most useful resources to offer. Princeton is a highly stressful place, but mental health education and treatment needs to be more personalized, friendly and individual, not institutional. The system as it is does not help enough people, and short-term campaigns such as the USG’s Mental Health Week are great, but not sufficient. However it happens, the system needs to change. The idea of peer mental health advisers and a fundamental strengthening of Princeton’s network of mental health and well-being services, from students to CPS counselors to private clinicians in the area, is just one possible solution. But the next time a sophomore comes to me depressed, desperate and in tears, telling me she has no one to turn to and wants to leave school, I want to be able to tell her, with confidence, that I can help.|~|Lauren Davis is a philosophy major from London, England.

54828|~|The Llewyn Davis syndrome|~|   February 9 2014|~|Column | Feb. 9 |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|Look closely, and you will see how often things fail. Take, for example, the failing of tree boughs under snow. Or, perhaps in our tango with academia last semester we realized that sometimes he is not a very kind dancer. Recently, I was reminded that failure (in all its permutations) often unifies members of a community as much as success does. That many Princeton students represent the quintessence of any particular field is not surprising. The diffusion of success among Princetonians, however, sometimes distances me from a reality in which people often find themselves stumbling and struggling everyday. On Feb. 6, after a screening of Inside Llewyn Davis, creative writing professor Paul Muldoon joined filmmaker Ethan Coen ’79 to discuss the film in the context of his career. Eventually, Muldoon invited the audience to ask Coen questions. One student, a philosophy major, professed her uncertainty about a post-university career. She asked Coen (once a philosophy major himself) how he managed to establish a successful artistic career from the humble foundation of his humanistic studies. Coen confessed that his major factored minimally into his work as a director. In fact, he acquired many of his movie industry contacts through his brother, Joel, who studied film at NYU. Whether intentionally or not, Coen echoed some of the major themes of Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, namely that exceptional success is guaranteed for few, and there are some people to whom it comes more willingly. In the spirit of those outliers, Coen attributed most of his fortune to luck (his fans may argue that talent has more to do with it than he might admit). Following the dialogue, a woman who I had spoken with briefly before the screening joined me in line to take a picture with Coen. The woman, a young University employee, told me that she had once contemplated film school, but her hesitation prevented the fulfillment of this path. She said that Inside Llewyn Davis was especially poignant for her, since it told the story of a musician “who was good, but wasn’t great.” Or, at least, he hadn’t met the right person. The one producer he thought could launch his career had told him instead to regroup with his former bandmate (for those who have seen the film, you will understand the terrible irony of that moment; reforming the duo was no longer an option for Llewyn). That was it, I thought. That was why the film seemed to me a comic tragedy. Chances are that most people could find something of Llewyn’s story in their own lives. At some critical moment which requires us to somehow exceed ourselves, we may learn that our abilities are only admirable, as opposed to outstanding. It seemed sadder to be “the person who almost made it” than to be “the one who never learned how good (or bad) they really were.” Maybe the Princeton employee would’ve discovered that film was not her calling; conversely, perhaps she would have had a natural affinity for the craft. The ambivalence of missed opportunity creates a cushion of uncertainty where one can imagine either of the two alternatives playing out. But unfortunately for Llewyn, his career stalled on the cusp of Bob Dylan’s musical revolution. Considered more broadly, I wonder how resonant Llewyn’s tale would be for Princeton students. I can tell you that I often doubt my own future as an artist. I write this column from home, having recently attended the first production of a play I wrote. After the show, I received some of the kindest words I could ever hope to hear. One friend even told me that, out of the people he has known from our high school, I seem to be the one that others will one day remember. Talk about responsibility. I think this is the most flattering and intimidating remark someone can hear. Especially as a Princeton student, I’ve worked hard to temper that nasty, smooth-talking ego by reminding myself that, in all likelihood, there are students here who have already memorialized their names. These are people you read about in the morning paper. It will take time to understand what that means. How prevalent is the Llewyn Davis syndrome in a place where all students are good, but few will be great? I reminded the employee that she was young. She said that, despite her youth, she had a sense of some kind of plan coming together. Film school hadn’t worked, but she felt as though her life would organize itself into something great. She seemed to approach the film with an understanding that Llewyn was not to be pitied. He did what he loved, and although he wouldn’t become Bob Dylan, he knew that he was good enough to be Llewyn Davis. This discussion is not exclusive to the arts. The education of scientists and mathematicians, for example, has become increasingly important to the American government. Not only is there job competition between students of different countries, but there is also the implied academic tension between students on the same campus. The chances of failure should not be your focus; rather, you should be comforted knowing that this is a place where you can at least attempt to become exceptional at what you love.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich.

54660|~|On constructive criticism|~|   February 6 2014|~|Column | Feb. 6 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Jason Adleberg From the late-night U-Store shopping sprees to the angry Princetonian op-eds, it seems to be that time of year again: Bicker is clearly on our minds, and it seems to have been for a while. Search results for “Bicker” on the Daily Princetonian website show 12 op-ed pieces published within the last year directly grappling with the subject — many seem to consistently pop up during the month of February. Two articles this week, by Uchechi Kalu ’14 and Zach Ogle ’15 particularly caught my attention not only for their content but also for the relatively large amount of comments both received. Underneath their opposing arguments, though, lies a familiar thread that frustratingly seems to unite all of the 12 articles: not a single one of these articles proposes action steps towards fixing our seemingly collective woe over bicker. For a campus of supposed “leaders,” I believe that we are suspiciously inactive when it comes to solving the Princeton-specific problems we complain about over internet forums and late-night conversations. I don’t think it takes much effort to diagnose that the Bicker process makes a handful of students deeply unhappy. But as a second-semester senior, I’ve yet to hear anyone make a serious proposal towards a remedy for our supposedly imperfect system. Though I’m sure that some students have thought about it, there doesn’t seem to be a framework to distribute these thoughts past our more immediate ten-page essays and problem sets. In fact, I would posit that complaining about things on campus is something of an art form, a uniquely Princetonian performance: an assumption of the forms of seriousness and virtue, of constructiveness and righteousness while altogether lacking the initiative to actually get anything done. Occasionally an article appears criticizing Bicker, or the Greek ban or the bonfire effigies, but rarely do a bunch of students come together towards working out a solution. And why should we? Apathy is cool at Princeton because we understand that “leadership” is simply an interview question that can be twisted and molded, unlike a GPA or standardized test that we can’t embellish. I would like to here (very) briefly propose a number of action steps in which we could attempt to better the Bicker process, since it seems certain it is not a perfect process. And though I doubt that the imperfections are totally perfectible, who better than Princeton students to work on an unsolvable problem? Hopefully, such an approach could catalyze the development of a framework within which students can attempt to fix various problems on campus. At worst, such an approach could at least lead to more conversations over dining hall tables. Problem: Bicker promotes a culture of exclusivity. I think that the Bicker process is not so much a cause of exclusivity as much as a symptom; students will probably always find ways to form cliquish groups. There are certainly benefits to tight-knit, “exclusive”, friend groups as well, and the development of political skills is certainly crucial for navigating certain arenas after graduation (like… politics). The notion of exclusivity is such a hard problem to solve because it’s desirable for some and abhorrent for others. But here’s a thought experiment: let’s imagine that passes and lists are completely gone, and that parties are open always to anyone with a prox. What would happen here? Certainly the Street would be a bit irregular for a few weeks, but over time I bet that the demographics of parties would remain exactly the same. Tackling the intricacies of “exclusivity” is probably way beyond the space allotted for this article, but I suppose it would be constructive to debate what would happen under the conditions suggested above. Having certain nights in which all clubs were unconditionally open would certainly reduce angst over “exclusivity.” Problem: Getting hosed hurts people’s feelings. I think this is sort of two separate issues: (1) the necessity of some students getting hosed, and (2) some having hurt feelings about it. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem that there is much to be done about the former, as eating clubs have limited capacities to serve food to their members. However, the latter issue could likely be improved if: (1) those not “hosed” were genuinely empathetic towards those who were, not for the duration of a text message but rather a longer amount of time, (2) the social chairs of each bicker club sent heartfelt, multi-paragraph messages to all those not accepted, (3) room draw for sophomores was held before Bicker. The painful element of surprise could also possibly be mitigated if students were aware of their standings throughout the process. For some, Bicker is like taking a pass/D/fail without any mid-term progress reports or feedback on exams. Though the suggestions are brief, hopefully this manner of approaching the subject is more constructive than arguing over whether Bicker is wholly good or bad. Does anyone believe Bicker is a perfect system? Clearly not. Does anyone believe that as students we actually have the power to change the system? I’d like to suggest that we do.

54657|~|Backspace love |~|   February 6 2014|~|Column | Feb. 6 |~|Spencer Shen|~|None|~|You, the reader, will never see the litany of corrections that went into this article before it made its way to publication, because it was composed entirely upon a computer screen — I say “composed” instead of “written” because there is an important distinction to be made between “writing” and “typing.” Almost all essays and papers college students submit are now started and finished digitally — in many cases, one submits the paper by email and receives an electronically submitted grade in return, an exchange that occurs completely within the virtual realm. Perhaps in the days before Microsoft Word, there would have been a few complete, handwritten drafts of a paper before any attempts to type it out, since antiquated typewriters admit no margin for error. But the modern principles of convenience and speed have all but rendered obsolete the idea of handwritten intermediaries between the thought and its expression as the typed word — not the written word. At the most, some prewriting and brainstorming is performed with pencil and paper, but more often than not, the typical student has neither the time nor the patience to write out a single handwritten draft of a 10-page paper, let alone two or three. Writing by hand is still an essential skill because it forces us to slowly, deliberately choose our words and focus on what we are writing. Past psychology studies have shown that writing by hand helps students learn more effectively and express their ideas more clearly, yet we still increasingly choose the convenience of the keyboard. At the heart of the ubiquity of word processing is its ability to infinitely undo past mistakes and accidents, represented by the all-powerful backspace key. Typewriters had backspace keys as well, but they only performed the literal job of “backspacing,” in which the position of the carriage would move backwards by one space — no deletion or undoing occurred, and the word “backspace” contains no denotation of such an act. It is only with the advent of word processing that “backspace” came to mean “delete”. The act of total deletion — more than simply striking through unwanted words — previously involved anything from throwing one’s papers into a fire to scratching out a mistake with a pen, but now it is inexpensive and invisible. Deleting our mistakes is becoming increasingly faster and easier than avoiding them in the first place, and the result is a collective devaluing of precision and neatness. The ease of pressing backspace freed us from the dread of having to start over, but at the same time, it slowly conditioned us to start and finish our work without planning ahead clearly or even at all. Over the course of typing the previous two paragraphs, I pressed my backspace key over 100 times, and one can only imagine that keeping count made me more careful and prevented me from having to use it even more frequently. Had I been using a typewriter, I would have wasted a lot of time and ink, or white-out, trying to rectify mistakes that were easily avoidable. The number of backspaces could have been reduced down to 50, or 20 or even zero, had I done some planning before I launched headfirst into typing. But if the final product would have been the same regardless of how many times I pressed backspace or whether I used a pen or a keyboard, why does it matter that I essentially wrote an article by trial-and-error? If our addiction to the backspace key were solely limited to writing, it’s possible that we could say “no harm, no foul” and move on. Unfortunately, like all addictions, the backspace key’s influence has extended far beyond the scope of writing. It has enabled sloppy, half-baked writing, and the same acceptance of mediocrity has spread to other facets of our lives. For example, cell phones are cheap and fragile, so a cell phone company would rather send a customer a new device than fix an old one, because doing so is cheaper. Why bother to do it right the first time if fixing the mistake is easier? In the case of cell phones, cost is only one of many things we weigh against the quality of the product. However, when it comes to writing, quality is our main concern, and we care much less about how much it costs, in time or effort, to produce a piece of writing. Typing allows us to be indiscriminate and unfocused as we write, but writing by hand forces us to be aware of what we say. I challenge us all to differentiate between truly “writing” our ideas down on paper and merely “typing” words onto a screen. Perhaps the Writing Program could incorporate this goal into the writing seminars and thereby inject more rigor into the academic writing training that they purport to provide. Every Princeton student, at some point during their four years here, should try writing an essay completely by hand and only type it up at the conclusion of the actual writing. Otherwise, one might graduate from Princeton knowing how to type but not really how to write.|~|Spencer Shen is a sophomore from from Austin, Texas. He can be reached at szshen@princeton.edu. 
54653|~|Many people shouldn't go to college|~|   February 6 2014|~|Column | Feb. 6 |~|David Will|~|None|~|It’s time for a large number of Americans to hear what might seem like a harsh message: A degree from a four-year university might not be for you. Popular culture would cast this frank assessment as elitist. But that’s a toxic myth that needs to vanish because the stakes are too high. A new study by Young Invincibles, a think tank geared toward issues facing young Americans, estimates that high youth unemployment costs the government about $25 billion in lost tax revenue. All the while, there are three million jobs that employers can’t fill because too many workers lack the requisite skills. Policymakers and university administrators have admirably worked to expand access to college over the past several decades. In terms of enrollment rates, their efforts have been successful — matriculation increased by thirty seven percent between 2000 and 2010. So, the good news is that we’re getting young adults on campus. But we are profoundly failing them as a country after that; America’s graduation rate sits at an abysmal 53 percent, including community colleges. This disparity betrays a critical disconnect, one not discussed often enough — that a large swath of those lured to college should never have attended. Seemingly insurmountable odds work against the typical young American. A college graduate today has to contend with an average of nearly $30,000 in student loan debt. The overall jobless rate for those between sixteen and twenty four is fifteen percent, more than double the national average. That said, the reality is that a large number of college students have no business being at four year universities. American culture aggressively pushes the college experience and dismisses skeptics as snobs. Master plumbers, for example, make roughly between $50,000 — approximately the national average — and $80,000 a year. So why is it considered so wrong to encourage people to pursue the profession, or another like it, instead of a college degree? One path all but ensures a life in the middle class; for far too many, the other only guarantees crushing debt and no degree. Relentlessly playing up the importance of a degree from a four-year university perpetuates an ironic snobbery. Those who emphasize the importance of a four-year degree often do so to the detriment of other paths to a prosperous life. We blindly push people toward college without considering if it’s actually the best option for the individual student. Meanwhile, community colleges and vocational schools, two phenomenal avenues to the middle class, are ignored. Advocates of college for all have created a culture that shuns people’s choices to pursue anything else. These destructive cultural attitudes manifest in government policy. States simply do not prioritize community colleges. “Between 1999 and 2009, community college funding increased just one dollar per student, while per-student funding at private research universities jumped almost $14,000,” write Eduardo Padron and Anthony Marx in US News and World Report. Large universities will obviously require more money overall to function, but the disparity in need can’t be that great. Government investment in community colleges is a sound one; an associate’s degree is a low-cost, high-reward chance at higher education and a better life. Other countries have already figured out that pushing every citizen into a four-year university is unproductive. Germany’s youth unemployment rate is 7.8 percent, while 5.1 percent of Germans overall are out of work. A huge secret to Germany’s success lies in its emphasis on apprenticeships. Students there have the option to apply directly to employers for training contracts starting at 16 years old. The program harnesses free market demand to meet employers’ needs. There’s no ludicrous stigma surrounding the process because people have seen that it works. The country is Europe’s economic engine partially because of the program’s success. The disparity between U.S. college enrollment and graduation rates is too vast to ignore. The fact is that, for many, college just isn’t the best investment. Political correctness is toxic and indulgent. It’s self-righteous censorship that too often harms the people it claims to help. The perpetual fear to encourage millennials to pursue anything other than a four-year degree hurts those very young adults. This timidity prevents advocacy for critical issues like funding for apprenticeships and community colleges. In this seemingly jobless economic recovery, one thing I won’t tolerate is continuing to leave young Americans behind.|~|David Will is a religion major from Chevy Chase, Md.

54498|~|A defense of Bicker |~|   February 5 2014|~|Column | Feb. 5 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Zach Ogle  The Bicker system isn’t perfect. Sophomores know it. People who are hosed know it. The vocal minority that loudly proclaims its hatred for the process certainly knows it. But every single member of every single bicker club knows it too. Believe it or not, bicker club members do not sit around looking for people to hose, making snap judgments about who is or isn’t fit for entry. Every year, rather, there are members who are saddened by the ranks of great people who are missed by the system and left out. Bicker does exclude, there is no denying it. But before we decry exclusion as inherently evil, we should examine why this exclusion exists. Bicker’s exclusion is based in hard realties. Eating club kitchens can only turn out so many meals. Club facilities can only hold so many members. If next semester the 400 or so people who bickered Cap & Gown Club this year and last were all accepted (assuming the numbers from last spring remain constant this spring), the club would have to serve over 400 meals at every sitting. This is simply impossible. Even if it weren’t, a key benefit of the club system — breaking the University into manageable and meaningful chunks — would be lost. Some form of exclusion, then, is necessary for clubs where potential members outnumber available spots. Bicker is indeed exclusionary, but this exclusion is a systemic necessity. The next step is to make sure we rely on a system that excludes in an acceptable way. Even here, Bicker isn’t perfect — ask the ranks of members who know people who they wish had been accepted. But lack of perfection does not make the system “brutish” or even “painfully corrupt,” as Uchechi Kalu argued in her Feb. 3 column. Few people relish the thought of rejecting bickerees. Success at Bicker does not depend on the name of your prep school, nor does it depend upon one’s race, gender or sexual orientation. Though some clubs are undeniably more homogeneous than others, this lack of diversity is a result of affiliation rather than any sort of active discrimination. In reality, success at Bicker depends on personality, friendships and extracurricular affiliation. Being friends or teammates with club members obviously matters, but not for any intrinsic value. Associations only matter because they influence the amount of interaction a bickeree will have had with members of the club, and thus how well members know them. Some may label this unfair, as denying a certain population a “fair shot at success.” But it certainly makes sense to allow club members to select from their current friend group when deciding with whom to build a larger circle of friends. Again, this system isn’t perfect. Without associations, success at Bicker depends too much on sociability in a contrived environment. People who would fit in well at a given club are hosed every year simply because their personalities do not come through in the stressful process that is Bicker. And that’s sad. But even if it’s not 100 percent successful, a system that seeks to judge based on personality and friendships makes sense. Yet somehow stereotypes pulled from a bygone era — when race and socioeconomic status were primary drivers in the social scene — still pervade. There is room to improve Bicker, but members of bicker clubs need not “soothe their psyches” because their kitchens can serve a limited number of meals. They simply need to work to make the process transparent and interactive so that each bickeree has the chance to show off who he really is. Even worse, the sweeping generalizations, bombastic tones and self-righteous sermonizing of Bicker’s detractors make for pretty reading but obscure the source of social pain rather than address it. The head hanging and “social shame” that classmates who are hosed endure has much more to do with the general campus culture than with the Bicker process itself. When it comes to bettering the culture on campus, we should treat the root of the problem instead of merely complaining about the symptoms. There are a number of ways that we can improve Princeton’s campus culture. We could stop deriving self-worth from our social groupings. We could stop applying our inherent competitive nature to socializing. We could let down our guard, stop pretending to be perfect and be more supportive. Changing Bicker or destroying the clubs won’t really change much, but treating the problem at the source will.|~|Zach Ogle is a Wilson School major from San Antonio, Texas.

54441|~|An expensive education|~|   February 5 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Princeton isn’t exactly known for being cheap. It ranks among the top universities in the world — but at the same time, the cost of a Princeton education is equally high up on the list. The elevated costs wouldn’t be such a huge consideration, though, if it weren’t for the fact that Princeton students, on the whole, also receive fewer hours of instruction than students at other collegiate institutions, rendering the price of one hour of Princeton class time much more expensive than the price of an hour of class at other colleges. If the semester here at Princeton feels short, that’s because, compared to most other universities in the United States, it is. While there is no authoritative data currently in academia to substantiate this claim, the numbers are quite self-evident. Universities that operate on the semester system — as Princeton does — can provide anywhere from 12 to 18 weeks of instruction per semester, but the majority of them offer 15 over the course of two terms, totaling 30 weeks in an academic year. Alternatively, schools that use the quarter system most frequently offer three terms of 10 weeks each, in the end totaling 30 weeks as well. However, Princeton’s academic calendar lies at the lower end of the spectrum, with only 12 weeks of classes per semester, or 24 weeks per academic year. Besides having fewer weeks of instruction, the amount of time actually spent in class at Princeton is also less. For instance, at the University of California at Berkeley, Math 53, their equivalent of multivariable calculus, meets for three additional hour-long discussion sections on top of three hour-long lectures, meaning that this class effectively meets for six hours a week. At Princeton, in contrast, MAT 201: Multivariable Calculus, the analogous math class, only meets three times a week, effectively half the length of time. The question inevitably arises — why is Princeton’s academic calendar different? Part of the reason may have to do with the fact that all faculty members are required to teach classes, regardless of whether they conduct research or not (at many other research institutions, professors who work in a laboratory are exempted from the need to actually teach a course), so mandating less time devoted to instruction may enable professors to better balance their academic research endeavors and teaching. Also, most instructors here offer flexible office hours outside of class time, indicating an academic culture that ostensibly places greater importance on self-responsibility of the students to get help when they need it. And, perhaps there may be a subconscious or subliminal belief that Princeton students simply learn faster. While there is no clear single reason why Princeton’s calendar is so different, the discrepancy begs consideration — is such a difference detrimental? In one regard — a purely financial one — students can feel cheated, seeing themselves as the victims of a swindling conspiracy of sorts. After all, for a higher price, they are receiving fewer hours of actual attention from their professors. But at the same time, Princeton has plenty of other redeeming characteristics. For one, students are effectively paying for not only a world-class education, but also for a “name brand” diploma (after all, the appellation Princeton is recognized worldwide), which may very well offset the greater costs per class hour in the form of better reputation and resources. Recruiters regularly visit top colleges such as Princeton seeking to attract the attentions of promising students, and simply saying that you are from Princeton often nets you the respect and recognition of others. In the end, the fewer actual weeks and hours of instruction that Princeton students receive has not in any significant way hindered the ability of seniors to move on to suitable jobs or higher education pursuits after graduation.

54435|~|Drawn and quartered |~|   February 5 2014|~|Column | Feb. 5 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|It is, by now, a fact of life to most of us at Princeton that we will see no real breaks during the academic year. Though placing fall and spring breaks after midterms theoretically allows a mid-semester respite, everything from essays to take-home midterms to midterms scheduled oddly in the week after break makes these less of a break, and more of a short stretch of work without classes. And this says nothing of our winter schedule. Our longest break — the five weeks of winter break and reading period — is situated at the exact time when students have high-pressure final projects and papers due, and finals themselves are just around the bend. This situation is especially poor for freshmen, who have little idea how much effort needs to be put into academics over winter break in order to adequately prepare for finals. Inertia and controversy over what any change to the calendar would look like, however, have kept this format since its Depression-era inception. Only by finding the best option for change to the academic calendar, and rallying as a student body and as a University behind it, can we hope to adjust our outdated system. As the fourth-oldest school in the nation, Princeton has a number of educational policies and other traditions which are unique, or at least rare, among U.S. institutions. Some, like the Honor Code and residential colleges, distinguish us even from our peer institutions and are justifiably lauded. Other, newer policies such as grade deflation are brave changes possible only because of Princeton’s prestige; love it or hate it, grade deflation raises important points about U.S. educational standards. But traditions as strange as Princeton’s winter non-break seem to be the product of mere institutional inertia. As James Evans reported in the Daily Princetonian before the 2012-13 winter break, much of the reason behind Princeton’s keeping fall exams in January has been due to simple lack of sustained effort to make the change. The last concerted effort to move finals in 2005 fell apart when students failed to unite behind a single revised system. Faculty members, also divided by several propositions, were resistant to the idea of moving finals before break because students tended to produce higher quality work, especially written work, when it was assigned over break. It makes sense that work would be high-quality, but the expectation that students spend their three-week break working defies the very idea of break. Faculty ought to have realistic expectations for what students can produce in the time allocated for academic work, and if the semester seems too short, advocate for extended instruction time or reading period rather than forcing winter break to absorb the overflow. Compare this to Harvard which, after several years of sustained student effort, moved its fall finals from January to December in 2008. That same year, Princeton undergraduates were surveyed, and it was found that 64 percent of undergraduates would approve of a similar change, while only 25 percent would oppose it. Then-USG academics chair Ben Lund ’10 took the survey as impetus to push change, as have various undergraduate student governments since then, including that of current president Shawon Jackson ’15, who indicated support for exploring changes to the calendar during both campaigns. The last administration was successful in adding an extra day to Thanksgiving break to allow those  who live across the continent to make it home for turkey, indicating that the USG can work with the administration to effect common-sense changes to the calendar. The next step is tackling what President Emeritus Tilghman called the “big Kahuna” of academic calendar issues — our winter non-break. As students, we can solve the problem of our own fragmentation. If students and faculty can’t agree on whether to move finals by eliminating fall break or moving the start of the year earlier, we won’t change the current system. Students can, however, agree to settle on one new calendar if chosen by a committee of faculty, administrators and interested students. Such a group should consider all options, including nixing fall break and moving the semester toward August, but also more drastic changes such as moving to the quarter system, which could keep fall start and spring end dates approximately the same (I, myself, am a fan of Dartmouth’s flexible “D-Plan”). Such recommendations, regardless of whether everyone agreed they were ideal, should be embraced by the student body since they would almost certainly be better than the four weeks of limbo we have now.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a sophomore from Littleton, Colo.

54268|~|Rethinking Intersession|~|   February 4 2014|~|Column | Feb. 4 |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|This past week, I visited my friend at MIT during the school’s Independent Activities Period, a month-long term that spans from the beginning to the end of January, somewhat parallel to Princeton’s Intersession. During this time, students can “organize, sponsor and participate in a wide variety of activities, including how-to sessions, forums, athletic endeavors, lecture series, films, tours, recitals and contests.” There were informal classes on figure skating, cooking, research methodology, etc. There were also formal, credited classes for certain subjects, including many pass/fail only classes. Some students also chose to take on winter internships, gaining perspective and experience that ultimately helped them decide upon or obtain summer opportunities in similar fields. Many students participated in the Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program, a career services program with company seminars and leadership classes, which has a near 100 percent success rate for matching its students with internships. Although Princeton’s Intersession is a break I fully support, especially following the end of stressful finals, I think Intersession could benefit from a stronger sense of direction and purpose. Many people don’t go home during Intersession because it’s right after winter break, and yet there aren’t many activities to do on campus. This year’s pilot Wintersession program, organized by the USG, was created in order to “build a community on campus during a time that is ‘unaddressed’ by the University administration,” U-Councilor Azza Cohen ’16 explained. The program met massive demand, counting over a thousand registered students, showing that students want to participate in organized activities during Intersession. According to U-Councilor Laura Du ’14, the top Intersession courses were the Excel Workshop, the My Money Workshop, Scientific Computing in Python, Effective Public Speaking and Intro to Cooking. The popularity of these courses demonstrates students’ interest in building practical skills and pursuing personal enrichment. Perhaps if the University formally acknowledged Wintersession as a part of Intersession break, the program could expand its membership and the number of courses available. Additionally, recreational activities offered during the school year are discontinued during Intersession, which detracts from the assumed purpose of providing a fun break to students after finals. Intersession could definitely benefit from USG movies, Broadway trips, skate nights and other activities that usually fall on school nights. These activities, if anything, should be offered more frequently during Intersession because there is more free time available than during the academic year. Intersession could also benefit from offering credited courses, although that would be more difficult considering the rather short time frame of a week. However, given the number of distribution requirements that students must satisfy and the number of interesting courses that Princeton offers, I think students would greatly benefit from having an extra pocket of time to fulfill those requirements and explore off-major courses. In particular, pass/D/fail-only courses could be feasibly condensed into a shorter time period in a way that lab classes and lecture and precept classes cannot. Winter internships would be another activity the University could formally acknowledge as a part of Intersession. Although Princeternships, alumni-based shadowing externships allowing for career exploration, are an option during Intersession, many companies such as Jane Street and Google offer full winter internships. Intersession would be a good time to pursue those internship opportunities, leaving winter break as a time to relax and go home. This way, students can gain experience to contribute to their summer internship search, before applications close. They can also decide what direction to choose for their summer internships, which is longer and more intensive. While IAP at MIT is definitively for pursuing out-of-class academic endeavors, professional opportunities and recreational activities, Intersession does not have that level of structure. Regardless of whether Intersession should be extended or not, it is clear that students want more direction and purpose during this time period. Intersession is a great time to relax after finals, but that goal is already fulfilled by not having class or academic responsibilities. Offering more activities during Intersession would be a great way to fulfill students’ interests in educating and improving themselves. Although some students may still prefer to use Intersession as an opportunity to just relax, it would be nice to have the option to do something else.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

54229|~|Editorial: Improve SCORE|~|   February 4 2014|~|Editorial | Feb. 4 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|During their four years of study, every Princeton undergraduate becomes familiar with SCORE, the University’s Student Course Online Registration Engine. The Editorial Board believes that given SCORE’s essential functions, such as enrolling in classes and accessing transcripts, it is currently subject to a variety of shortcomings and inconveniences that interfere with its efficiency and utility for student users. SCORE serves key functions including updating personal information such as emergency contact numbers, processing payroll data and enrolling in and changing courses. Accessing the system is necessary to see anything from distribution requirements and degree progress reports to information about academic advisers. The capacities of this engine have even recently been upgraded by installing an earlier direct selection of precepts through the system. While SCORE has the content and potential of a powerful tool, it is restricted by certain factors, beginning with its availability. This engine has operating times that limit student access. It is unavailable every morning from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m., except on Wednesdays when the window is extended further to 8 a.m. The Board recognizes that the shutdowns are likely due to maintenance or security needs but that these functions should not require daily inconvenience. SCORE also only has certain functions, such as course registration, open during very specific and usually limited times. The Board sees the restricted window for course registration as particularly incapacitating, especially since it closes over winter, Intersession and summer breaks. Many students are still modifying and altering their class selections during the break time leading up to the beginning of classes and cannot effect the decisions they are considering. Students are also left out of external developments such as messages from professors, precept openings and syllabus announcements that could greatly affect the compatibility of their schedules. While these restrictions are a burden, logging on is a more fundamental issue. The log-in procedure for the SCORE system is notoriously fallible and often shuts down log-in attempts brusquely and for no reason. At times, students are immediately excluded from the system on the first try and, in spite of repeated careful attempts, are still denied access. Occasionally, there is no remedy other than the great trouble of changing passwords. The suggested alternative of changing Internet browser is similarly erratic and inconsistent. Even during the limited time SCORE is open and available, full access is not a guarantee. Even once log-in is achieved, most of the useful information is oddly organized and poorly presented in the user interface. The links are small, unclear and often hidden. Finding desired information on SCORE requires much trial and error, and there are some sections so remote that few people even know they exist. Useful information such as automatically calculated GPA and quintile ranking is available but unknown to many students because of its inaccessibility. The Editorial Board believes that the University, particularly through the Office of Information Technology and Office of the Registrar, should make efforts to improve these complications and improve the quality of SCORE. The varied difficulties found in availability, accessibility and interface limit students’ ability to complete academic and enrollment functions and utilize the information on SCORE for their academic success. Integrating SCORE log-in into the Central Authentication Service could perhaps mitigate log-in problems. Another improvement could be to create an integrated system for all student information. While SCORE contains many vital functions and information, much other class information is housed on the Blackboard system. While there are further complications to integrating the separate systems, the Board sees improving SCORE as the beginning of many possibilities to better serve the student community through improved online resources.|~|
54231|~|On skimming |~|   February 4 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|In her October 9 column “Skip the skimming,” Prianka Misra wrote about the increasingly prevalent phenomenon in humanities classes at Princeton to assign reading that far exceeds what is humanly possible for a student to complete. The Daily Princetonian’s editorial board later agreed. Misra wrote that course syllabi that proudly flaunt 200-300 pages of reading per week “beg for insincerity.” While it is certainly true that several hundred pages is a lot of reading — probably more than a student can feasibly do for a single class on top of other coursework, extracurricular obligations and sleep — I don’t believe we should be so quick to dismiss the idea of skimming. Skimming isn’t a mark of insincerity. Rather, it shows a strong ability to prioritize. Skimming doesn’t impart a superficial understanding of a topic. It imparts the most important facts, because it’s hardly ever the tiny details that make or break your understanding of a topic. The things you learn in college aren’t limited to the things you stay up late studying, such as the exact mechanism of a gene inversion or the deeper theory behind Nietzsche’s later work. You also build a work ethic and learn habits that help you succeed in a more general sense than just passing an exam. Learning to skim helps you survive in college, but will also absolutely carry over to the real world. Skimming is a necessity in virtually any profession that you could end up pursuing in the future. Lawyers need to be able to skim their case files, gleaning the essentials in documents that they perhaps don’t have the time to prioritize. Doctors need to be able to skim literature when they’re trying to diagnose a patient, as meticulously reading through a whole library of case studies is a waste of valuable time. Furthermore, Princeton has long been working on a way to standardize policies across departments. The most infamous example of this is the grade deflation policy, which was put in place in part to keep some majors from being significantly “easier” than others. No one could argue that humanities at Princeton are easy, namely because they assign so much reading. In my opinion, the amount of reading assigned is in part to match the level of time commitment required by science and math students. Take a simple example. CHM 303/304: Organic Chemistry has two 80-minute lectures a week, in addition to a three-hour lab and a 50-minute precept. This comes out to a total of six and a half hours. A representative history class — HIS 361: The United States Since 1974, for instance — has two 50-minute lectures and a 50-minute precept, which adds up to two and a half hours of class time. Keep in mind that this is just raw class time. Science problem sets are notoriously intensive, with time commitments as high as 12 hours per week in some courses. Science majors usually take two or three such classes at a time. For a humanities class to be roughly the same time investment as the average science class, it would require an additional seven hours of homework, outside of class time. If the average college student can read 40 pages in an hour, it just about evens everything out. Now, there are obviously many simplifications in this example. It’s not that class times should be extended unnecessarily to even things out across departments. And this does not in any way speak to the difficulty of the material being taught, either. A philosophy class can be just as challenging as one in the biology department. But in terms of how many concrete hours per week a student has to devote to a certain class, heaps of reading is one of the most obvious ways to even out the interdepartmental playing field. It’s very true that the workload measured in pages is sometimes downright egregious in certain classes offered here. But the time commitment asked of students enrolled in these classes isn’t any more than what is asked of students in other departments, who cordon off three-hour blocks of time for labs and problem sets. Beyond that, adapting to change is one of the points of coming to college. In the end, you come to college knowing that you’ll be challenged more than you were in high school. Skimming is an incredibly important tool with a great measure of practical use for the future.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

54070|~|Outside the Bubble: An inappropriate punishment|~|   February 3 2014|~|Column | Feb. 3 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Last week, news broke that the Department of Justice would seek the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who, along with his deceased brother, was allegedly responsible for the bombings during the Boston Marathon last year, taking the lives of three people. According to Attorney General Eric Holder, “[t]he nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision.” Although the crimes he is charged with undoubtedly “betrayed his allegiance to the United States” and inflicted extreme pain upon all those affected, the United States should not try to seek the death penalty because it is an inappropriate punishment for even the most heinous of crimes. For years, the issue of the constitutionality of the death penalty has been hotly contested. It was even held unconstitutional between 1972 and 1976 as a result of Furman v. Georgia, which claimed that the “harsh, freakish and arbitrary” nature of sentencing clearly made it unconstitutional. The question of whether capital punishment constitutes something like cruel and unusual punishment appears to be a difficult one. The main concerns of the past, such as in Furman, were ones over its accuracy — caused by fears that its imposition was arbitrary in the sense that not all who were accused of murder received the death penalty, and often decisions were decided on the basis of race or class. However, what if the evidence is clearer? What about cases such as Tsarnaev’s in which we can prove with almost little to no doubt that the suspect is responsible? It was this logic that compelled the Supreme Court to restore capital punishment’s constitutionality only four years later in Gregg v. Georgia, requiring that there simply be “objective standards to guide, regularize and make rationally reviewable the process for imposing the sentence of death.” Some of the resultant standards are the proportionality of the crime committed to the punishment, the methods of execution and the limitations on using it against certain groups like juvenile and mentally retarded criminals. Still, even in a case where one’s guilt is much more determinable, capital punishment is still excessive. The justice system serves multiple functions in society. One of its main purposes is to remove threats from society. By using retributive justice to punish wrongdoers, we constrain those victims who may view the government’s supposed ineffectiveness as justification to otherwise rely on vigilante justice. In the case of capital punishment, we clearly do not aim to rehabilitate, and the goal of removing one from society can be achieved without taking a person’s life. In light of this, we seem to only be able to justify the taking of a life either on the basis of retribution or deterrence. When we choose retribution, we resort to a Hammurabi-esque “eye for an eye” mentality. Granted, any punishment will be somewhat retributive, as ignoring it may lead to an even greater desire for it, but it is the government’s job to try to limit this vengeance as much as possible. When we deal with crimes that involve the death penalty, which can only be done if the accused is charged with taking the life of another, it is easy to be swept up by emotion. However, the justice system is not meant to please the will of the majority, but rather to apply a punishment that will do its best to incapacitate those who may do us harm. That being said, if it can be proven that capital punishment serves as an effective deterrent and reduces the incentive for others to kill or murder, it may be somewhat justified. Yet, even this is questionable. To serve as an effective deterrent, as Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law and public health at Columbia Law School, argues, “Execution would have to occur with sufficient frequency and with widespread knowledge among would-be murderers to create a credible threat considering the types of murders that might be eligible for execution.” The problem is that many are misinformed. With issues such as racial and class disparities and the long periods of time spent on death row by prisoners before actually being killed, it would appear that capital punishment fails miserably at serving as a deterrent. In fact, one only has to look at the contrast between states that do and do not allow the death penalty post-Gregg. In the 1980s, states that permitted it had an annual rate of 7.5 criminal homicides per 100,000; states that removed the practice had a rate of 7.4. In deterrence, we should seek the least severe punishment that achieves our aims. We can remove threats like Tsarnaev from society through less barbaric means. In light of its failure as a deterrent and our expectations of being in society, it appears that capital punishment is an improper punishment, even for the worst of crimes. Although it is tempting to wish for the death of those who bring us great harm, the state should be better at remaining objective than the individual. Otherwise we will devolve into barbarism — letting our emotions blind us from doling out fair and rational punishments.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn.

54093|~|Making the connection|~|   February 3 2014|~|Column | Feb. 3 |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|It’s February, and while this can mean a lot of different things for Princetonians, there’s one particular feature of the college experience that many of us undergo at this time: applying to internships. While I can’t speak for everyone, I would say the search for the perfect internship is always a fairly stressful one. First, it’s always tempting to apply to the first few that you fall in love with. Even with your heart set on one specific opportunity, though, contingency plans must always be made. With each summer possibility comes a time-consuming application, or equally as frightening, a simple request for a cover letter (the magical formula for which I have yet to crack). Still, these parts of the process cannot compare to the one that will forever haunt me: letters of recommendation. If I’m being completely honest, asking professors and former bosses for letters of recommendation is not even the most stressful part of the process. What’s actually stressful is the connection-making that requires one to feel comfortable enough to make these requests. All other stressful parts aside, I often feel like a large part of networking involves making artificial relationships and hoping they will become more natural for the sake of personal advancement. It’s not as if the people we seek out here are insincere. In fact, I would argue that the most helpful resources here are the professors and alumni. Here, professors are dedicated to both their work and their students. Just this past semester, I couldn’t make any precepts for a particular course. I thought I would have to drop it, but my professor created an entirely new time for me and four other students in a similar situation. In this instance, he showed us both his dedication and his accessibility. Creating new precept times isn’t very common, but using office hours to reach out to students is a more obvious option that is equally helpful. They make getting help with your paper or simply introducing yourself to your professor much simpler. Moreover, if your schedule does not allow you to attend your professor’s regular office hours, many are so accommodating that they will schedule time to meet with you personally. I found out quickly that — as many Princeton pamphlets and tour guides insist — professors really are here to help. Our alumni network is also unbelievably strong and enthusiastic. At the end of every academic year, hundreds return to Old Nassau to reminisce and reconnect with old friends over Reunions. Still, many come back for more than the good times Reunions offer. They return to help current students, whether it’s through imparting wisdom of the real world, post-Princeton, or getting us connected with people whom they think may be of help professionally. And while many of us may think we need to wait to reach out to this network of people until after graduation, they are accessible throughout our undergraduate careers and beyond. One of my own friends was able to find an amazing internship doing biomedical research with an alumnus at Penn, and she would have never found it had such an amazing opening not been posted online. With these resources, it is no wonder so many Princeton students say a major deciding factor of their enrollment was the quality of networking. Our time here is so pivotal and, no matter what each of us decides to pursue upon graduating, having connections is ridiculously beneficial. But for students who are unaccustomed to the world of networking, the prospect of reaching out for guidance or advice can be a daunting one for a number of reasons. There is always the fear of being brushed off. Worse, there is a fear of negative judgment. But my greatest worry has always been, and will always be, coming off as insincere. I love being a wallflower at times, but I also enjoy meeting new people, talking about our common topics of interest and just hearing their stories in general. If it flows, then it flows. If not, it might be disappointing, but it’s simple to walk away. Networking is a slightly different ballgame. I feel strange when I seek help from a professor outside of the classroom. I don’t feel disingenuous, but I do fear the entire situation is a bit more forced. It can also be intimidating talking to a person who has studied for years what you just discovered you’re interested in week ago. Furthermore, while the ease of the conversation or connection-making process is still important, a lack of ease does not necessarily mean it’s best to walk away. I hope that one day, when I email a professor or a potential connection, it’ll be with more confidence and less (hopefully subtle) unease. The tiny feeling of guilt that tells me that I am using someone will be gone, because I will have fully realized and accepted that people do in fact want to help us, and that using these connections is not a crime.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La.

54043|~|A tradition of casualties |~|   February 3 2014|~|Column | Feb. 3 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Uchechi Kalu As the tides of Bicker crash upon us I raise a middle finger one final time to the parasitic system that has won the unquestioning loyalty of Princeton’s social culture. We continue to delude ourselves into believing that maintaining the integrity of Princeton lies in our ability to subject classmates to social isolation and shame. I have long since been unmoved by claims of the clubs’ overarching inclusivity. I sulk at exaltations praising the efficacy with which our clubs bring together disparate student populations. In truth, Bicker is but Princeton’s version of playground politics — “friendships” are determined through terms of utmost irrelevancy: the name of your prep school, the combination of your Greek letters, your athleticism, your extracurriculars, your perceived ‘rowdiness,’ your perceived ‘class,’ how token African-American/gay/Asian/ethnic you are … These are but external factors that say nothing about the virtue of a person. In ignorance, we use them as signifiers of social worth. And yet Princetonians continue to portray Bicker as the ultimate tradition, where social exclusion and exclusivity are but the backdrop to a process that provides every student a fair shot at succeeding. The ease with which we facilitate our peers’ social humiliation only to suppress our own guilt thereafter is appalling. Once and for all we must bury the question that drives Bicker: “Would I have a meal with you?” We derive its answer through means so nebulous and infantile that it is impossible to consider ourselves well-formed adults. No student body should flaunt a process as morally questionable as Bicker. And no accredited university should have an established platform for students to resurrect their grade school addictions for being “liked,” “wanted” and “chosen.” What amazes me most is the naive candor with which we’ve learned to justify Bicker. The excuses are endless. To a confounding degree Princetonians proclaim that life is just a large-scale version of Bicker. We say that social exclusion is inevitable and often preferred. We say that Bicker is just preparation for what is to come. If any of these excuses are even true, then the “real world” is nothing but a country club. We’ve got it all wrong. Exclusion is best used in our world as a means of efficacy. For example, when a job or leadership position opens up, it is crucial that only a few candidates are chosen. With the most capable people on staff, work is completed efficiently. Exclusion, therefore, plays a justifiable role in society because it identifies and rewards merit and intellect. Bicker does neither. Bicker thrives on petty exclusion. I’ve often heard people rebut, “Well, I have the right to choose my own friends.” Sure, choose the members of your church so you’re all praying to the same God. Choose the members of your book club, so no one complains about reading Nicholas Sparks’ novels week after week. But don’t limit who you dine with at Princeton and then justify Bicker with pre-packaged responses that are so overdone they reveal just how little you’ve thought about the process. Conducting (or even attending) Bicker is not a life skill, nor is it a valuable part of what we should consider tradition. These excuses are meant to soothe our psyches when cognitive dissonance takes hold — when we remember how painfully corrupt the process is and yet continue partaking anyhow. This goes out to everyone gearing up to bicker someone else: Think not about the successes, but the casualties. And that those hosed will be your friends and classmates. People no different than you will be forced to hang their heads in shame unless they sign in to an alternative club, bicker in the fall and succeed, or finally “get over it” as I’ve often heard people mutter with arrogant nonchalance. We throw around terms like “tradition” and “The Princeton Experience” as if they can somehow justify a social system as brutish as Bicker. Let’s stop fooling ourselves. There is nothing about Princeton culture that makes this acceptable. Just because Bicker existed in the past doesn’t mean we must continue to perpetuate it. As long as we do, we bring shame upon ourselves, our values and our intellect.|~|Uchechi Kalu is a Near Eastern studies major from Orangeburg, S.C. She can be reached at ukalu@princeton.edu.

53880|~|Fighting SPIN: An introduction to the 138th managing board|~|   February 2 2014|~|Column | Feb. 2 |~|Marcelo Rochabrun|~|   Editor-in-Chief Emeritus     |~|There is a peculiar and obscure group on campus, even though, at around 200 members, it is almost as large as the full staff of The Daily Princetonian. The group is run by the Office of Communications — the University’s central public relations office — and is aptly called SPIN. It seeks to brings together “a broad range of communicators … to discuss communication strategies,” according to a report filed late last year to the Priorities Committee.  They even have monthly meetings and subgroups, cleverly called SPINoffs. Their goal, as well as the purpose of spinning news on this campus, was summarized in a 2010 blog post by the Office of Athletic Communications. Spin means “to be as positive as possible about your own school,” the blog read. In general, SPIN members are largely responsible for officially communicating to the world what is going on at Princeton. At the ‘Prince,’ however, we pride ourselves at deconstructing spin — both uppercase and lowercase. Today’s issue marks the beginning of the 138th Managing Board of The Daily Princetonian. Our commitment is simple: we want to raise the quality of the journalism we put out every day, across every section of this newspaper. Now more than ever, the University community needs an independent news organization to uncover the uncomfortable truths that are sometimes cleverly spun or often ignored in official releases. This year, we will be more aggressive than ever at uncovering the news, at fighting spin, while providing more informed commentary through our Opinion section. But taking an aggressive stance also means having to look ourselves in the mirror. News organizations seek to expose all sorts of things about all sorts of people in the name of “public interest.” But, who holds news organizations accountable? Their readers, of course. If we demand transparency, then we must also be transparent to our readers in return. In this spirit, the ‘Prince’ is publishing its internal code of ethics online, a set of guidelines that is mandatory reading for all our staff members and details the standards that we seek to uphold, as well as the regulations we have in place. We acknowledge that student newspapers face fundamentally different challenges than professional publications. We are prone to conflicts of interest. Our community is small and reporters maintain a dual identity as journalists and full-time students. Publishing our code of ethics, however, will allow the reader a unique window into our journalistic practices. We feel that this will allow our readers to better understand our stories and to be able to call us out when they feel we have acted unfairly. Our goal is transparency. Although we generally don’t face any direct competition — the ‘Prince’ is the only daily newspaper in town and the only independent news source on campus — our biggest competitor is not in the news industry: it’s in public relations. It’s what my predecessor, Luc Cohen ’14, called “propaganda” in his farewell column a few weeks ago. Our competition is carefully-planned, stealthy communications strategies meant to look, read and feel like news.  For example, Princeton calls its press releases, “news releases.” Even searches on Google News will often lead to links to the University website, even though these hits are anything but news. In such conditions, news organizations like the ‘Prince’ must aggressively rethink the way they approach the news to make sure we maintain the upper hand against those who are out there to defend an agenda. Take the recently-released 2015 University budget, for example. The official announcement highlighted an increase in financial aid and ingeniously spun a 4.1 percent tuition hike as its opposite. On average, the release said, students are now paying less than 10 years ago (what the Office of Communications called “net cost”). However, the release all but ignored the fact that almost half of the student body (40 percent) will be negatively affected by the increase. In addition, deficits and lower endowment returns forecast for the next six years went almost unmentioned, painted as an afterthought in the last lines of the release. The University’s SPIN group is almost as large as our staff, and it will only get bigger. Just last month, the Board of Trustees approved the hire of a new staff member for the Office of Communications, considering this effort as one of a handful of “high-priority needs.” The mission of the University’s public relations efforts, as stated on its website, is to protect and promote “Princeton University’s reputation for excellence.” In the memo requesting the new hire, the same office argued that without the position it would risk a “diminished capacity to shape favorable perceptions of the University and to motivate supporters of the University to speak out on its behalf.” At the ‘Prince’ we are not here to protect anybody’s reputation nor to shape perceptions, but to give the readers the information they ought to know. In order to do so, we want to ensure that we report accurately, independently and with integrity.

53775|~|One of the cool kids |~|   February 2 2014|~|Column | Feb. 2 |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|One day in high school, my mother was helping me wash my hair and pulled a large clump of hair out of my scalp. Bewildered, she asked me what was going on. I had to tell her about how I was burdened by stress from the daily harassment that I received from my peers.  It was always at lunch, when the most people were around.  Someone would point at my argyle socks or mention my use of proper English and then everyone would laugh.  It had gotten so bad that my mother had pamphlets of neighboring private schools already laid out on the kitchen table at dinner.  I stuck it out, though, because I thought that there was a chance that I could be like one of the cool kids some day. They dressed in the latest trends, spoke in slang, got invited to all the parties and always had girlfriends or boyfriends. At least when I went to college, I thought, I could create my own individuality. I could start fresh, where no one would know my history. Unfortunately, Princeton made me discover that “cool” was directly synonymous with being in a selective eating club. I knew from freshman year that I wasn’t much of a party person.  If I went out on the street, I’d only be there for about an hour or so before going back to my dorm. I never felt like I was missing out on anything.  Every time I went to a party, my high school fears returned: my clothes weren’t nice enough, I wasn’t pretty enough, I didn’t know enough people and most of all, I couldn’t relax because I was worrying too much.  Nevertheless, I was convinced that I had to be in a club. Being independent or in a co-op was not an option for me. The Street is the most publicized social outlet for upperclassmen, and people are well-informed about the different personalities of all the clubs: artsy, bohemian, political, diverse, southern, rich, athletic and more.  The plethora of pictures from formals bombarded my Facebook feed every fall and spring. No one wants to feel left out. There are some Princetonians who have never been interested in this scene, because the entire process seems unfair.  In a sense, it is.  It can only take one person in the club who has clout to say something bad about you, and then it’s over.  No matter how friendly you are, how many extracurriculars grace your resumé, or how many people you know, you are liable to be rejected from the club, or “hosed.”  I learned that the first and only time it happened to me. It was a huge blow to my self-esteem because I couldn’t understand why it happened.  And furthermore, the dream of recreating my identity as someone cool had shattered. I did eventually end up in an eating club during my junior year and met great people there. But deep down, I felt like something was missing. The club itself was fine: great food, friendly people, interesting parties — and by this rationale alone, I could not understand why I still lacked something inexplicable. I didn’t feel like I had a deep connection with anyone besides those who I met before I gained entrance into the club, ironically. Besides that, the majority of my friends were on independent meal plans, and it was hard trying to schedule a meal to see them. With the exception of formals, I never stayed at the parties for too long because I always felt anxious because I wasn’t making out with anyone or I dressed too conservatively. Even though I was in a popular club, I still didn’t feel that way. I didn’t fit the level of prestige that I bought into. Then, I realized that I was never supposed to be there in the first place. You can add as many labels to your name and reputation, but at the end of it all, when you strip them all away, you have to face yourself.  You can only run from it for so long.  Although I could feel like I had a sense of confidence because I was in a bicker club and people always asked me to reserve spots for them at the next party, it ultimately did not matter. I am still that awkward girl who flakes out at parties. I am still that girl who wears the argyle socks and plaid skirts.  But the difference between my years as an underclassman in both high school and college is that I now own up to these characteristics. Right now, I’m on an independent meal plan, and although my social life consists of small dinner outings and dorm room powwows, I have the freedom and peace of mind that I didn’t have before. I learned to not deny who I really was, and that realization changed the tide of my self-esteem. I was too busy looking at everyone else for security instead of looking within. We do ourselves a huge disservice when we try to pigeonhole all that we are into institutions, whether great or small.  And at the same time, it is a disservice to pigeonhole others when they tell us which club they are in or which organizations they are involved in.  To all students who are bickering this week, I say good luck. Some of you will get through, but many of you will not. I just hope that you don’t try to use an eating club to make you who you already are. I never became one of the “cool kids” because that idea was nothing more than a projection of low self-worth. I still admire people for their coolness, but I’m in the process of cultivating myself to be the best — and the  “coolest” — that I can be.|~|Morgan Jerkins is a comparative literature major from Williamstown, N.J.

53779|~|Service is a bit like faith |~|   February 2 2014|~|Column | Feb. 2 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Kyle Berlin I currently live in Urubamba, Peru. I’ve been here for more than five months now, and will be here for at least another four. As a participant in Princeton’s Bridge Year Program, I work with an NGO on a variety of projects in rural Andean communities, live with a host family, practice my Spanish, explore the countryside, and otherwise engage in the daily business of living as a North American in Peru. After reading a November article in The Daily Princetonian about a planned service trip to Urubamba this spring break (“Pilot service trip program to expand solar power to Peru”), I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. The Princeton project, in coordination with the organization We Care Solar, plans to bring two “solar suitcases” to install in two communities in the region, with the idea of extending light into the nighttime hours, theoretically allowing students to study longer. While the project itself doesn’t sound like a bad idea, the article’s representation of the trip made me cringe a little, both as an incipient Princetonian and as someone currently immersed in Peruvian culture and so-called “development work.” It seemed to fall into the trap of what I’ll (quaintly) call “The Four ‘S’s of Service Sin,” as I see it: Firstly, and most egregiously, sensationalism. One of the Princeton “team members” suggested that Urubamba lacks running water and electricity. In fact, as I write this, I sit in the heart of Urubamba with the lights on, connected to Wi-Fi and listening to jazz on the radio, as the kitchen sink runs upstairs. Certainly the Princeton student who alleged in the article that “especially places like Urubamba” lack water and electricity did so out of an understandable ignorance and not as an intentional act of mendacity. But there are far too many cases like this one where poverty is trivialized by its commodification. When the severity of conditions in a place is exaggerated to increase the heroism of outside “helpers” or garner more support for their efforts, we reduce the humanity and livelihood of an entire people to nothing more than a tool for our own selfish and convenient purposes. Secondly, the article highlighted a disturbing case of what I like to think of as “savior syndrome.” A Princeton student quoted said that most people have no idea “how much help [these] communities need.” I dare this same Princeton student to approach the people in “these communities” and tell them that they have no idea how much help they need. As soon as we see ourselves as singular saviors, rescuing poor helpless people from a life of misery, we are bent away from policy and projects that work and toward those that make us feel better about ourselves. And, of course, when we see ourselves as superior and saving, a pernicious arrogance that suffocates and a paternalism that never dies are instantly spawned. For example, a Princeton student interviewed in the article wants to know “how they deal with that,” without ever specifying who “they” are or what “that” is. One cannot help but fear that “they” may be an undefined mass of poor short brown people, and “that” is living a life that isn’t the privileged one this Princeton student must know. Lastly, I was made uneasy by the glints of shortsightedness and simplification I saw in the article’s representation of the project. The solution to a lack of equal and full educational opportunity and its frequent result—poverty—is a lot more complicated than to give a Peruvian a fancy solar light, they study hard at night, before you know it they’re a Princeton graduate and making lots of money as an investment banker! Hooray! Each small project (in this case, two solar lights in two homes) may do good, but we cannot be so shortsighted or deluded as to represent a small good as a panacea for an entire problem. I want to be clear: I am in no way denigrating, discounting or discouraging the work of We Care Solar or the Princeton cohort coming in the spring. They are aware of a real problem and doing something to address it, and that’s the first step. But there exists a way to tackle poverty, to perform service that doesn’t reduce entire populations of people to caricatures of what Westerners imagine the picture of poverty to be. There exists a way to help without reducing the dignity and autonomy and capability of those accepting help — for, after all, that is what they are doing — generously accepting help that we want to give. Finding that way isn’t always easy, especially in an environment (a country and a university) that so actively encourages service as a shallow bellwether of a person’s goodness — a seething game of one-upmanship and faux-heroism that is never spoken about but almost universally acknowledged. I still don’t fully know that perfect way to serve. Perhaps it doesn’t exist. But I would prefer to believe that service is a bit like faith: with a healthy dosage of doubt, much questioning, a great deal of thought and humility and openness to spare, we can tap into something great.|~|Kyle Berlin is a member of the class of 2018 from Arroyo Grande, Calif.

53506|~|Putting the “propaganda” in context|~|   January 12 2014|~|Columns Opinion |~|Luc Cohen|~|   Editor-in-Chief Emeritus     |~|In an interview last May, former University President Shirley Tilghman told me she doesn’t believe everything the University says about itself. “If you start believing all your propaganda and believing that we’re perfect, you will fail as the president,” she said. Everything we do at The Daily Princetonian is guided by the belief that the truth shouldn’t be the exclusive possession of the people who “need” to know it in order to make policy and advance their interests. We all deserve an objective account of the University’s successes and shortcomings so that we are better placed to perpetuate the good and reform the imperfect. And yet I can’t count the number of times during my year as Editor-in-Chief of the ‘Prince’ when someone has tried to negotiate with me not to run a story that portrays them or someone they represent in a way they perceive to be unfavorable. I’ve also lost track of the number of complaints I’ve received claiming a story we’ve published is unfairly negative toward one of the parties involved. While it is important for readers to distinguish between a biased story with an agenda and a fair story that brings unfavorable information to light, engaging in these conversations will always be one of the most crucial components of the Editor-in-Chief’s job. People and organizations seek press coverage that advances their interests and try to avoid coverage that does not. That’s nothing new, and editors before me have had hundreds of the same types of conversations. But what is new is the ease with which source-produced information and content — what Tilghman would call “propaganda” — can be shared directly with its intended audience. On Facebook and Twitter, posts from news organizations are mixed in with messages straight from the source. The increasing popularity of social media has shattered the virtual monopoly the press once had on the spread of information, and it has made it easier than ever for powerful people and institutions to spread their messages, unchecked by a pesky third party like a newspaper. Many sources even have greater reach than news organizations: Princeton University, for example, has 100 times more Facebook likes and 15 times more Twitter followers than the ‘Prince’ does. Some sources and readers correctly understand this source-produced information as positively spun competition to the objective press narrative, while others truly think it is the only information that needs to be out there. From what I can glean from reader comments and casual discussions, news consumers are becoming more deferential to straight-from-the-source information as they are exposed to it more frequently This is true beyond Princeton, of course. To the extent that disruption and changes in communication methods prompt news organizations to be innovative in the ways they tell stories and engage with readers, these changes are a net positive. But to the extent they allow sources promoting their own interests to bypass objective sources of information and reach their audiences directly, they pose significant dangers. Throughout my tenure, we’ve set out not to contradict our sources’ “propaganda” with “negative” stories, but rather to complete the stories our sources share themselves. We’ve published the results of a previously unreleased University survey on students’ experiences with sexual assault, described the tendency of athletes to cluster in similar majors and examined the biography of a new president whose image was being carefully crafted and protected. While we received substantial criticism in all of these instances — we have been called “sensationalist” and “intrusive” and criticized for “making Princeton look bad” — on the whole readers appreciated our objective use of hard facts to put the “propaganda” in context and complete the story. Readers have also been openly appreciative of our attempts to share the truth during breaking news events. During the Nassau Hall gunshot scare, traffic to our site maxed out our server capacity before the University had sent out a single alert. During the December gas leak, an employee tweeted, “So nice of Princeton to alert the employees!! Find out from the news!!” I’m no expert on emergency notification policy, so I’m not sure if the University’s responses were appropriate in these cases or not. But these responses indicate that people affiliated with Princeton crave information about Princeton. Those who know this information — sometimes, but not always, for good reasons — often decide to withhold it. This makes it so crucial for news organizations to provide the complete story without bias or deference to any party’s strategic interests, especially since social media and sponsored content have given readers more frequent and direct contact with officials’ “propaganda.” Tilghman was right: It’s important for officials not to believe all their propaganda. But it’s also important for us, as students, citizens and news consumers, to be skeptical of the information the University and other powerful institutions publish themselves. And as the news organization covering this campus, we will continue to work tirelessly to make sure the community has the information it needs.|~|Luc Cohen, a Wilson School major from New York, NY, is the outgoing Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Princetonian.

53473|~|Editorial: Use of un-prescribed stimulants violates academic regulations|~|   January 12 2014|~|Editorial | Jan. 12 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|When prescribed, psychostimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin can play an important role in aiding students who suffer from the academic difficulties caused by ADD and ADHD. However, given the fact that these drugs have a high capacity for abuse as illegitimate academic aids, the Editorial Board believes that “Rights, Rules, Responsibilities” must be amended to reflect that students who use un-prescribed psychostimulants in an attempt to gain an unfair academic advantage should be regarded as having violated RRR’s academic regulations in addition to its drug policy. It is no secret that class work can be stressful, difficult and demanding, especially during exam times, but the University is especially dedicated to maintaining certain rules and requirements to ensure that academic work is carried out fairly and productively by everyone. Violations of these academic regulations currently include plagiarism, using false data and unauthorized multiple submissions because these behaviors subvert the universal bounds within which everyone can, and is expected to, complete their work. Professors also often impose rules regarding the use of calculators and class notes in order to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity when completing an assignment. Princeton has an obligation to make its best effort to impose an academically level playing field, and the abuse of un-prescribed stimulants interferes with this effort. Psychostimulants may be used in an attempt to gain an unfair academic advantage. The Board recognizes that these drugs may also be legitimately used in other contexts by students with attention deficit disorders. However, when students use un-prescribed psychostimulants in order to enhance concentration, energy or stamina in the context of completing any academic work, this should be considered cheating, just as taking extra time on a timed take-home exam is considered cheating. Both of these infractions violate students’ and professors’ expectations that assignments are completed under conditions that are specifically and equally provided. The Board recognizes that these drugs do not make individuals more intelligent, but insofar as they may facilitate concentration and certain students have continuously used them because they have found them to aid in concentrating, they provide certain students with an unfair advantage. Use of un-prescribed psychostimulants is unlike other study aids, such as caffeine, and is deserving of special scrutiny. All students can drink caffeine (or another legally available stimulant if they are allergic). Those who choose to abstain from this activity presumably do so because it is not in their self-interest. Not all students, however, are willing to violate the law, and thus these psychostimulants uniquely promote academic inequality across students and deserve to be considered academic infractions. The Board recognizes that this policy would face enforcement issues. We would not be comfortable with the University employing drug tests in order to test for the use of un-prescribed psychostimulants, but we believe that the presence of multiple, reliable witnesses could be used as evidence in this kind of case. We further recognize that a host of drugs have the potential to serve as study aids, and the University must be careful not to craft a policy that would simply cause students to shy away from certain drugs and toward others. This policy may also touch on students’ privacy concerns as they relate to the confidentiality of medical information. It is worth noting that there would be some precedent for this policy. In September 2011, Duke University implemented similar measures to consider un-prescribed drug use cheating in addition to a violation of the drug policy. The two committees charged with upholding academic regulations at the University are the Undergraduate Honor Committee and the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline, and the Board suggests that both bodies make efforts to officially address the un-prescribed use of psychostimulants as academic violations in their respective jurisdictions. By categorizing the use of un-prescribed psychostimulants as cheating, the University would be able to take a small step toward discouraging the illegitimate use of such drugs and to ensure a level academic playing field.|~|Abstaining: Eve Levin 
53450|~|To be or not to be admitted |~|   January 12 2014|~|Column | Jan. 12 |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|“3,042 students, or 78.9 percent, deferred in third year of U.’s early action program.” That should have been The Daily Princetonian’s headline on Dec. 16, as that was the real, interesting story regarding Princeton’s undergraduate early action admissions. Instead, the ‘Prince’ article focused on the 18.5 percent of early applicants, 714 students, who were admitted, representing only a 0.2 percent increase from last year. That statistic isn’t a surprise at all. Moreover, Princeton falls into the middle of the pack for early admit rates among other Ivies and selective universities. Stanford admitted 10.8 percent, Yale 15.5 percent and Harvard 21 percent. But Princeton only denied 49 early admit students, less than 1.3 percent of early applicants, banishing the vast majority of the high school seniors who applied early to college-admission purgatory for another four months. Having been in that position last year, I empathize with the frustration these high school seniors must feel. It’s no fun being in limbo — and the letter you receive provides no clues as to whether you really have a chance of getting in. It merely states that you are being thrown back into the pool of regular-decision applicants to be judged yet again. And when you look at Princeton’s numbers this year, you really feel like being deferred indicates nothing. It doesn’t suggest you have a good chance of being admitted during regular decision, as there is no way they can admit everyone later. Last year Princeton only accepted 1,931 students overall, including those admitted early. It’s time for Princeton to recognize that its admission policies do not only affect those admitted but also the thousands of students who apply and are deferred. These deferred students cannot move on and start getting excited about other schools either, as being deferred leaves the slim hope your top choice might still accept you. Understanding this reality, Princeton should limit the number of students deferred during early action decisions to those who really have a decent chance of being admitted come regular decision admissions, especially given the decreasing overall admission rate due to a larger applicant pool for a similar amount of spots. A reasonable policy still defers students, but not almost 79 percent. Part of the aim of admissions is to accept the students needed to yield a diverse class that fills the needed roles. Who knows if a better trombonist will apply regular decision, so it might be best to put one on hold from the early pool. Reality demands for some students to be deferred so the University can have some flexibility in molding the class during regular admissions. But deferring students at the rate Princeton is doing seems far from necessary. The fact that many peer institutions are not doing the same suggests just that. Stanford was notorious for giving students from my high school a straight answer in December. Students were almost always accepted or denied. Current statistics suggest that this is true nationwide for Stanford, as its December 2013 deferral rate was only 8.5 percent. Yale’s and Harvard’s 2013 deferral rates are fairly high, coming in at 57.6 percent and 68.1 percent, respectively, but they are still lower than Princeton’s deferral rate at almost 79 percent. It would be understandable if the University could provide a legitimate reason for why our deferral rate differs so much from Stanford’s or even Yale’s and Harvard’s, but the school’s given rationale for the low rejection rate doesn’t seem sufficient. According to the ‘Prince,’ when asked why the number of rejections had declined significantly, Dean of Admission Janet Rapelye responded that her office had decided to “give students every benefit of the doubt” and make sure students had a chance to turn in all of their application materials. And it’s true that the problems with the Common Application this year might explain providing some leeway to applicants, but, honestly, most students will not change dramatically from November through March. Any rationale put forth justifying this policy only seems to value the University’s interests — interests that don’t even seem legitimate when you consider that a peer institution like Stanford doesn’t need to employ the same tricks to cultivate a diverse class. And even if there might be some real reasons for the policy, they ignore the young adult on the other end of the message, who doesn’t know whether to celebrate or cry. And given the statistics at a highly selective university like Princeton, the student likely won’t get in. Deferral makes being satisfied with your second or third choice that much harder in the spring. Unless absolutely necessary, Princeton shouldn’t subject students to that agony. And for at least some of the 3,042 deferred students this winter, it probably wasn’t necessary. Plus, just think how badly this policy makes the 49 denied students feel.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu.

52968|~|Fixing ObamaCare (Yes, We Can)|~|   January 7 2014|~|Column | Jan. 7 |~|Katherine Zhao|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|As the confetti settled in Times Square, the New Year rang in with the first wave of new insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act, widely known as “ObamaCare.” The White House reported that more than 2.1 million Americans have already signed up for private insurance through the ObamaCare exchanges. Though the Affordable Care Act is a huge leap toward improving the future of health care access for Americans, ObamaCare does come with its share of problems. However, when the United States is an outlier on the map of developed countries that all have some form of universal health care, and Americans spend more per person on health care than citizens of countries with universal health care, the solution is to steadily smooth out the rough spots of a new legislation and fix its problems. With Republicans clamoring for its repeal, the government shutting down over the dispute, and over two dozen states refusing to opt in to ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion, the answer is still not to get rid of ObamaCare. Unfortunately, one of the immediate results of ObamaCare was the cancellation of insurance coverage for 4.7 million Americans whose skimpy and lower-cost plans did not meet the ACA’s strict standards. As the cancellations became a target for opponents in November 2013, the President announced insurance carriers could extend for one-year plans that would have been cancelled, and people whose plans have been cancelled will not be subject to the tax penalty for not having insurance. Someone, somewhere, must foot the bill for extending affordable health care to everyone and that someone must be the demographic of young, healthy people. The laws of economics rule that unless there are young healthy people paying for the sicker Americans, ObamaCare cannot be sustained for very long. When sick people have insurance, the insurance companies cover medical expenses. If healthy young people buy insurance, yet do not incur medical expenses that insurance has to pay for, then insurance companies gain. Thus, the healthy people who pay for insurance balance out the payments insurance has to make to sick people. The people who eagerly signed up for ObamaCare insurance first were the ones who had preexisting conditions and were previously denied coverage or could not afford the extraordinarily high prices. In 2012, there were 18 million uninsured 19-34 year olds, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and it was reported that this demographic accounted for “40 percent of the uninsured population under the age of 65.” If ObamaCare is to survive and not raise the deficit, as President Obama promised, then young, healthy people must buy insurance to balance out the payments insurance must make for sick people’s expenses. Currently, under the ACA, an individual who does not have insurance by March 31, 2014, will be fined $95 a year or 1 percent of their gross income, whichever is higher. This penalty will get more healthy, young people to balance out the insurance payments of older and sick Americans. While tackling ObamaCare’s problem of costs is essential to moving forward in improving access to health care in the United States, we also have to step outside the box for a minute and consider our health care system as a whole. On Fox News, former Gov. Mike Huckabee criticized ObamaCare for only addressing insurance coverage, and not health care itself and the costs of health care, which are “out of control.” Statistics show that 75 percent of the medical expenses incurred throughout a person’s life are from the last two years of life; as Governor Huckabee says, “We don’t run to the finish line. We don’t walk to the finish line. We basically are drugged to the finish line.” This attitude, resulting from the high availability of medical procedures — albeit at high costs — toward the end of life, is that if you can fix it in the surgery room, then fix it. In the rush to administer countless drugs and procedures, expenses pile up to the sky. Some of these procedures may even be unnecessary, if a person nearing the end of  life desires nothing but to go peacefully without undergoing a series of superfluous procedures. Seventy-five percent of medical expenses are incurred in the last two years of the life, and 80 percent of health care costs in the United States are for chronic diseases. Instead of spending so much money on last minute treatment, the focus should be on action taken to prevent chronic diseases. The three easily targeted causes of chronic disease are obesity, lack of exercise and smoking. The Affordable Care Act is the first step towards picking up America’s lagging access to health care. But, in order to catch up to other developed nations’ in terms of health care, the current problems of the ACA must be addressed, and eventually the law should extend to encompass the health care system itself, by tackling the sky-high costs and improving its efficiency.|~|Katherine Zhao is a freshman from East Brunswick, N.J.

52930|~|The decline of the Renaissance man|~|   January 7 2014|~|Column | Jan. 7 |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|In 1829, Thomas Young, hailed “the last man who knew everything,” died, taking with him an era in which the polymath reigned supreme. During his lifetime, Young established the existence of light waves through his famous double-slit interference experiment, wrote several works in linguistics, helped develop the concept of Young’s modulus in materials science, contributed to the decoding of the Rosetta Stone and even entered the life insurance business. During Young’s time, the world population was less than an eighth of what it is today, with a smaller proportion literate and educated, collaborations were more difficult, and it was easier to make discoveries and significant contributions to several different fields. Today, the growing population, the Internet and more widespread education have accelerated the rate of advancement in any field exponentially. This in turn makes merely having a workable basis of knowledge in any field much harder. For example, any research chemist nowadays must have extensive training in lab techniques and technology that didn’t exist a hundred years ago, not just theoretical knowledge. A historian has access to more and more documents through electronic means, increasing the detail of his knowledge and thus narrowing his field of study. There is no such thing as a polymath in the modern age; the closest cousin would be a dilettante or a dabbler — a “jack of all trades, but a master of none.” The specialization of knowledge explains several fields branching into subcategories — for instance, biology into biochemistry, physical biology, neurobiology, etc. In our increasingly specialized world, it is hard for people with a humanities focus to jump into the technical sector, and vice versa. The vice versa is less talked about simply because the state of our current job economy, and the projected economy in the future is increasingly reliant upon technical jobs. Looking at our current trajectory, the majority of top jobs in 2022 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics will be specialized, technical roles. In these roles, it’s much harder for humanities majors to adapt their skills — these types of jobs require specific, fundamental knowledge, such as higher-level math and programming. According to the New York Times article “A Decline That Makes Economical Sense,” this explains the decrease in humanities majors. Harvard, another New York Times article states, experienced a 20 percent decline in undergraduate humanities majors over just the past decade. A recent Business Insider article repeats some of the common defenses for the preservation of humanities majors: they actually better prepare you for a technical job, because “you actually learn how to think and write … there are enough poorly written emails in the world already” or “degree and GPA matters less, emotional intelligence, data and skills matter more.” This is an untenable defense because technical jobs have concrete requirements, just as becoming an English professor has concrete requirements. It is an insult to say that a humanities major’s skills are limited to writing better emails in a technical or managerial job. An extensive education in the humanities is meant for so much more than as a marginal side-advantage in an unrelated field. Even though most humanities majors can’t feasibly jump into technical jobs, research and academic positions that are meant for humanities majors are vitally important in a social context. The humanities are about questioning social tenets, about making people think about what they value, which is equally as important as any other major. The decline in the number of humanities majors does not reflect a decline in their social importance, but simply reflects the current job economy. Continuing with the trend of the decline of the Renaissance man, jobs will only become more and more specialized, and a basic working knowledge of any field may approach encyclopedic proportions. In turn, majors will become more and more indicative of the type of job you can qualify for after graduation. That’s not to say we shouldn’t continue to try to diversify our knowledge. In spite of specialization, it’s important to remember that preparing for a job is not the only reason we learn things. Even though perhaps there will never be another true polymath to the extent of Thomas Young, it should not stop engineering majors from taking a humanities class, or a humanities major from taking an engineering class. In our increasingly specialized world, that is the only thing keeping us from becoming singular encyclopedia articles.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

52960|~|Memories vs. experiences|~|   January 7 2014|~|Column | Jan. 7 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In a TED talk titled “The riddle of experience vs. memory,” Daniel Kahneman comments on the world’s increased focus on the topic of happiness and the obstacles we face in measuring and judging happiness objectively. There is “confusion between experience and memory,” he says. “Being happy in your life and being happy about or with your life [are] two very different concepts.” How we feel in a given moment and how we later remember that experience usually tell two different stories; the story that sticks is the latter. As 2013 came to a close, most of us probably took a moment or two to reflect on the past year. The last few weeks of December are generally a time of reflection and resolve; we want to determine what we did right, what we did wrong and how we can go about doing better in the upcoming year. So, we reminisce. And how we judge 2013 will be contingent on how we remember it. If our memories are fond, 2013 will forever be remembered as a happy year; if the memories that stick are less than favorable, our overall judgment of the year will be impaired. Increasingly, end-of-year reminiscences involve looking through various forms of social media in order to get a grasp of just how great or dismal the year was. For the past couple of years, Facebook has offered users the chance to look through a review of highlights of one’s activities on the site over the course of the year. This year, Flipagrams — automated photo flipbooks posted to Instagram — were the trend. CTFxC, a video blogging channel on YouTube that features a couple’s daily “vlogs,” uploaded a particularly touching review of their highlights of 2013; they decided which memories were noteworthy by looking through each video thumbnail and recalled the events of each day. Though most of us do not have access to film footage of our daily activities dating back to Jan. 1, 2013, we can review the year in similar ways. Many of us spent time clicking through “Photos of You” and old Instagram posts to find snapshots captivating enough — read: impressive enough — to put in a Facebook collage or a Flipagram. When it comes time to look back, we want to find evidence of the exciting memories — the ones that make it look like our lives are one big party full of international travels, flashy events and getting drunk with friends. It may be true that, in the end, the only experiences that will matter are the ones we can still remember. But life isn’t just about the grand, momentous occasions. It’s entirely possible to hold on to memories of smaller, more intimate moments — at home with family, in Frist, at lunch — if we’d just take the time and effort to look past the screen. It’s a shame that their availability has made us tend to focus only on the memories that we have easy access to. It’s an even greater shame that too often, the “highlights” that are captured in Facebook photos, Instagram posts, Tweets, Vines, and so on are only a fragment of what we should consider meaningful experiences. They consist of only a small portion of the vast pool of memories that can change the way we feel about the past year — memories that can change the way we evaluate how happy we were in 2013. Kahneman says “the remembering self is the one that makes decisions. We don’t choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences.” The choice, then, is ours — we should be cautious not to let social media platforms decide for us which memories we should choose. We should pick the memories that will let us remember 2013 as a year of happiness, and not settle for the ones our Facebook profiles deem noteworthy.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan. She can be reached at ljkim@princeton.edu. 
52794|~|Editorial: Reduce assigned reading|~|   January 5 2014|~|Editorial | Jan. 5 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|While the Board does not know the amount of material that is humanly possible to read in a week, the Board suspects that many humanities and social science courses assign reading in excess of this amount. Students, in an effort to read as much as possible, sometimes skim through the material and arbitrarily select chapters to read, undermining their own learning. As such, we sympathize with many of the concerns Prianka Misra voiced in a column earlier this semester. Assigned reading is an essential piece of Princeton coursework, but students all too often fail to thoroughly read assigned material, taking shortcuts instead. The Board encourages Princeton professors to enact measures to ensure that assigned reading can be completed by students who are actively engaged in the Princeton community while enrolled in four classes, and then hold students accountable for the assigned reading. One solution to this problem is reducing the amount of required reading. While some may object to this measure, claiming that doing so would reduce the depth and breadth of Princeton courses, the Board does not recognize this as a significant harm. Currently, many students fail to read the complete set of material that professors expect students to internalize. By lessening the amount of required reading, professors would be able to better manage students’ reading selection. With a reduced reading load, students could be better expected to fully digest the most important material, instead of skimming, and largely forgetting, a mix of important and inessential texts. Moreover, professors can keep the less essential reading on their syllabi, designating it as optional, so that students who have enough time and inclination can further engage with the subject material. The Board also recommends that, if possible, professors distribute guided reading questions. Almost always, a select portion of the 300 pages of reading assigned each week is especially important. By giving such questions to students, professors can help students hone in on what is most essential to the course. Such a list would also help ensure that students are prepared to engage with the questions that will guide precept discussion, thereby increasing the quality of precepts. The Board believes this measure would greatly improve students’ learning, independent of a decision to reduce students’ required reading load. Finally, after decreasing assigned reading, professors could employ assignments and quizzes to ensure that the reading is completed. When a student does not prepare for precept, he or she stymies the entire class’s learning. We believe that for the previous measures to have a beneficial effect, professors must make sure that all students are reading the important material that professors have designated as required or made the subject of guiding questions. Given that professors would limit the amount of material being assigned and inform students of what is essential to read, the Board feels that such assessments would be more than fair to students. The Board recognizes that creating such assignments would entail additional work for professors. We thus believe that professors could partially substitute for these assignments by raising precept expectations and evaluating if a student’s precept contributions suggest that he or she has engaged with the reading. Above all, the Board believes that reducing the reading load of many social science and humanities courses will improve the quality of the education we receive at Princeton. This reduction need not signify decreased commitment from students. Instead, if properly managed, it could lead to greater student engagement with the most important texts covered in courses.|~|
52812|~|Royals|~|   January 5 2014|~|Column | Jan. 5 |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|There I sat, alone in my room (and for all I knew alone in all of Holder) and thinking of finals yet to be studied for and paintings yet to be finished, while Lorde’s drawling notes eased out of my stereo. I’d only ever been mildly interested in Lorde’s music since her recent rise to fame, but for whatever reason I found solace in her songs during the lonely moments I was on campus during the last week of break. About halfway through each play through of her album “Pure Heroine” (which, with my blinds drawn and lights dimmed, seemed an appropriate title), the familiar lyrics of “Royals” began. And through the haze of my Heroine high I raised my glass to Lorde. Lorde has managed to encapsulate my feelings toward wealth in a way I have been unable to articulate without coming across as a callous materialist. To be frank, I completely deny the maxim that money does not buy happiness. It does. There are few things that are not for sale and happiness, for the most part, does not make that list. In some way, Lorde shares my belief. While she does not bluntly state it as I have, she does allude to it; she claims, like those who uphold the aforementioned maxim, that she has no interest in the luxury that fascinates our generation (and indeed every generation), yet at the same time she is acutely aware of her own desire to be “Queen Bee.” I want to be King, and I’ve no qualms admitting it. The majority of serious issues people face in our nation and the world is a result of financial hardship. Famine, disease, infant mortality and ballooning populations all stem from poverty. Even on a less dramatic scale, it’s much easier to smile when enjoying a family meal in a comfortable kitchen than if the rent is overdue and the children are defrosting groceries bought on credit while a parent works a second job. Money would let the latter family share conversation and a meal and would allow childhood laughter to survive a little longer before fading into adult responsibility. Cents and dollars, as much as they are denounced for their coldness, are precisely what could give such a family warmth. As for concerns unrelated to financials such as death, incurable disease and family disputes, monetary instability tends to only aggravate them further. Even love — an undeniable factor to happiness and touted as a precious commodity that is as available to the poor as it is to the rich — is not entirely immune from the influence of money. In a study concluded in 1992, “money disputes were [found to be] the best harbinger of divorce,” contributing to a 30-40 percent increase in divorce rates of the 2,800 couples analyzed. Money, while perhaps still unable to purchase real and honest love, can at least help to keep it intact. But Lorde’s song does not focus on such modest aspirations. Both the song title and her pseudonym make it clear that the type of wealth she suggests is that of the richest of the rich. Such financial security allows those in the top economic strata a freedom to pursue happiness that those with fewer dollars could never afford. And, despite the claim that money is the devil, these pursuits are not necessarily materialistic or self-centered, either. Travel, cultural exploration, education, career development and talent enrichment — all barely attainable by the lower and middle classes — can all be funded by a stuffed bank account. Still, such objectives may be seen as selfish. But surely acquiring immense wealth is more selfless for the charitable person than choosing a life of strict asceticism; many more dollars may be donated to altruistic causes when one’s salary is six or seven digits than when one is eking out a meager existence that can barely provide for themselves, let alone others. Of course, most of us attending Princeton are not planning on living the life of a Puritan fundamentalist, but the premise remains the same: No matter what gives us happiness and no matter what we value, more money very often means a higher attainment of those ends. I am not affirming that, without an inexhaustible amount of money, humanity is damned to a life of wretched misery. Indeed, happiness can be achieved across all three economic classes, and for that we should be grateful. Yet I do believe that money makes happiness much more accessible and attainable, especially in our modern, global economy. And while I wish to dispel the strange and somewhat hypocritical taboo surrounding financial ambition, I recognize the delicate line it walks beside greed. What separates the two, however, is gratitude: gratitude for what one currently has while still looking forward and striving for improvement. With that said, I will continue to dream of crystal, Maybachs and tigers on a gold leash unashamedly, fully aware that each dollar I receive buys me one dollar more of happiness, yet always contented with just the fantasy.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

52805|~|Representing a full range of careers|~|   January 5 2014|~|Column | Jan. 5 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Azza Cohen and Kemy Lin Even though we see the snow falling on the castle we call Princeton, we’re thinking about the summer. We are perusing TigerTracks and PICS (and Google) for internships and asking ourselves what we want to do over the vacation — a time for learning outside the school curricula, a time to experiment with prospective careers. When we looked through the organizations registered for the 2014 Summer Internship Fair for “Visual Arts,” we found two marketing internships, but nothing that encompassed the broad range of visual arts such as photography or film production. When we looked for “Creative Writing,” we found none. When we searched  “Economics,” we counted 29. For those of us pursuing careers in the arts — where internships, experience and portfolio development are critical — this is more than disheartening. Of course, one argument is that this is proportional — more students are studying economics than visual arts or creative writing. However, there are students interested in pursuing careers in the arts who concentrate outside the disciplines of architecture, art and archaeology, visual art, theater and creative writing. Career Services has done a poor job of representing, let alone advertising, career paths in creative fields. Countless finance and consulting firms host recruiting events on campus, so these careers are visible to every Princeton student. Furthermore, these firms do a brilliant job of finding student talent and leaders on campus by sending out personalized emails, bringing alumni to campus to recruit and targeting student groups. Consequently, this has created a culture on campus in which many people see these careers as the only option and feel forced to reconsider their passions. Stanley Katz, a professor in the Wilson School and the director of the Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies wrote in an email, “One of the pleasures of my 35 years at Princeton has been working with so many talented students interested in the arts and culture. Many of them are now pursuing professional careers in those fields, but it has not been easy for them (it never is!). Anything the University can do to help them jump-start their aspirations in arts careers would be a tremendous boon — and an encouragement to others with similar talents and interests to come to Princeton.” The appointment of a new director, Pulin Sanghvi, represents a special opportunity for Career Services to reassess its strategies and recognize its shortcomings, particularly in its representation and promotion of careers in the arts. A step in the right direction has been Career Services’ support of the student-initiated Creative Careers Conference (full disclosure: we’re spearheading this), specifically helping put us in contact with various resources to plan such an event. We are grateful for this support; however, we believe that Career Services could make a more visible effort for students like us. We have some ideas. First, Career Services could begin with bringing more creative professionals to campus to host recruiting events. It could more actively advertise internship opportunities in creative fields, and perhaps launch a “creative career fair” similar to the career fairs that exist for start-ups or science and technology. It could build partnerships with creative agencies and sponsor trips to New York to meet with alumni pursuing the arts. As Kelvin Dinkins, Jr., a member of the Class of 2009 who is pursuing a career in theater management, recalled via email correspondence, “I also attended a meeting with undergrads at [Theatre] Intime last year who unanimously agreed that what they want … is more practical, professional experience and networking capabilities with fellow Princeton alumni working in careers similar to their own aspirations.” Career Services could help cater to different professional needs of students pursuing creative arts, such as different resumes and support for self-branding. In a phone interview, Stephen Tepper, who earned his Ph.D. in sociology here as well as helping found the Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies reassured, “It feels risky and it feels scary, but [creative professionals] are happier. That’s the most important story to tell.” Beyond the obvious fruits of encouraging careers in the arts, a concerted effort by Career Services would also help students committed to other careers get a chance to experiment with new interests. There is increased scientific evidence that an exposure to the creative arts increases productivity in other spheres of life. Princeton is not an arts school, nor do we wish it were. But please, Mr. Sanghvi and Career Services — show us that passion for the arts is not only a possibility, but a priority for Princeton students.|~|Azza Cohen is a sophomore from Highland Park, Ill.

52512|~|Editorial: Returning final exams|~|   December 12 2013|~|Editorial | Dec. 12 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|It is an all too frequent occurrence in Princeton courses that professors do not return final exams and papers even after final course grades have been posted. This practice reduces the transparency and accountability of course grading and deprives students of valuable feedback. Therefore, the Editorial Board believes that it would best serve the educational mission of this University to implement a policy requiring faculty to return graded final exams and papers to students at the end of each semester after grades are posted. First, a policy mandating that final papers and exams be returned enhances the accountability of the grading process. When, at the end of the semester, students are only able to see a final course grade posted on SCORE, there is no assurance that their papers and exams have been fairly and thoroughly graded. The proposed policy would ensure that students are able to at least see their exam scores and what questions they got wrong or their final paper grades and any written comments, thus holding professors and preceptors at least minimally accountable in their grading practices. Second, the proposed policy makes it possible for more students to avail themselves of the opportunity to ask for re-grading. The board believes that the opportunity to request re-grading of papers and exams in an important procedure that helps to maintain the fairness and accuracy of grading. Professors and preceptors grading an exam may make mistakes, questions can be poorly phrased or a paper may be hastily misread. Students can only avail themselves of the opportunity for re-grading if they are able to see their exams and papers and dispute any potential grading mistakes. The board believes that the benefit of allowing students to ask professors to rectify mistakes that occur in grading outweighs any potential concerns about abuse of this system. Lastly, a policy requiring final exams and papers to be returned is important in providing students with feedback that helps them to learn from their evaluations. There are clear educational benefits to students of understanding what questions they missed on an exam or learning the strengths and weaknesses of their final paper. While feedback is important throughout the semester, it is particularly significant for final assignments, which are often culminations of students’ learning throughout the course. Without a policy mandating that final exams and papers be returned, students too often do not receive any feedback and are prevented from learning as much as they could. In terms of implementation, the board believes that the University should either mandate that all exams and papers be returned or that exams and papers must be returned at the request of any student in the course. Students should be able to receive their finals as soon as possible after the end of finals period. Recognizing that some professors may reuse exam questions, the board believes it may be prudent for students in some courses to be allowed to see their graded exams for a period of time but not be allowed to keep them. The board further believes that the benefits that accrue from allowing students to review their exams exceed the costs of perhaps compelling certain professors to create new exams each year. In the spring semester, when students may return home before exams and papers are graded, professors and their departments should make reasonable attempts to return finals electronically or by mail, if requested — though exceptions would obviously apply to exams with questions that may be reused. All in all, such a policy would further Princeton’s educational mission by increasing academic feedback and making grading more accountable.|~|
52489|~|The pregame manifesto|~|   December 12 2013|~|Column | Dec. 12 |~|Susannah Sharpless|~|None|~|This is a campus structured around success. We chose Princeton because we wanted it to be as important as it promised us we would be; Princeton chose us because we had proven that we wanted it. In high school, we had shown ourselves to be — more so than hundreds of thousands of other high schoolers — responsible, intelligent and obedient; teachable and tractable. Now here, we are being primed not to enter the workforce, but to command it. We are expensive parts of an even more expensive machine that churns out value-creators, trained in how to lead, how to innovate, how to generate capital. Some day soon, we are told, we will control Capitol Hill, Wall Street, Silicon Valley and we must learn how to be these kinds of people: Leaders, trail-blazers, bosses. It’s a rhetoric that permeates every aspect of our lives and it is most problematic in how it mutates the Street — one of the only spaces we have on this campus to relax, though thankfully not the only — into something stressful, hectic and ethically problematic. It’s a kind of economic system with passes and spots as currency. The easier these are for you to get, the more powerful a member of the system you are. It’s a hierarchy of users and the used. For certain campus demographics, going out involves as much networking as a career fair, sometimes even literally: Club cultures don’t only coalesce around shared social circles, but shared career goals. The two depend on each other, in a kind of quiet but ominous symbiosis. The biggest problem I have with “hook-up culture” or whatever The New York Times is calling the way our generation socializes right now is not the random sex and excessive drinking but the monetization of the lived experience. The more crazy and egregious and humorous your exploits, the higher your social value. The best partiers I know capitalize on their excesses, converting them from possible regrets to proof of how fun they are. They got so blacked out, they tell you, had such random sex and walked home in their sweatpants and ran into their preceptor and passed out in a random entryway. It’s another deposit into the bank of social capital: My partying has value, they say. My partying is helping my brand. But imagine a night out that doesn’t advance your career, whether social or actual. Imagine a night that doesn’t involve capitulating to the demands of the existing power structure in order to obtain little colored pieces of paper that imply you’re a functioning member of their system. Imagine that instead of going to an eating club where everyone is running around frantically trying to get everyone to notice that they’re there, always looking around for someone better to talk to, searching for someone to make out with so they have some proof that the time they spent removing themselves from achieving actual success was not in fact wasted, you could spend your nights out not in frantic competition, but in a loving and warm environment. Luckily for everyone, I have an answer, and the answer is: The pregame. It’s time for us to embrace the revolutionary potential of the pregame, to stretch it out extra-long, maybe so long that it becomes the whole night, that you don’t even go to an eating club afterwards. When a pregame is good — and I’ve been to some wonderful pregames — they don’t start over a listserv or a public Facebook event; they start when someone you know sends some text or some email like, “Hey, I’ve got a little alcohol and some free time, let’s chill, come over whenever, I’ll be here.” They’re good because everywhere you look, you see someone you love, or at least feel warmly towards, and no one is trying to get you to chug some weird flaming drink, and no one is dressed for any theme, and no one wants you to take a picture of them or be in a picture with you so they can upload it and prove that they were in x place at y time with z amount of socially powerful people. By harnessing the power of the pregame, we can subvert a system of value that not only defines what it means to be a successful Princeton student, but also what it means to have fun. Someone might argue that a better use of free time might even make us more productive workers, but I am uninterested in that angle. What is more important is that we realize how important our unstructured time can be and to embrace it. We need to remember how valuable each of us are, and how valuable every second we have is and to spend that time chilling out about it.|~|Susannah Sharpless is a religion major from Indianapolis, Ind.

52493|~|Taking a break|~|   December 12 2013|~|Column | Dec. 12 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|While trying (and failing miserably) to finish up an essay in the study room in Holder basement, I suddenly felt the urge to go to the bathroom. Right as I was about to return, my phone buzzed with a cryptic response “Don’t come back. Assassins.” What had initially been a short trip to resolve a physical inconvenience had in an instant turned into a matter of life and death. Hiding around the corner, the machinations of my pursuers taunted me. I scanned left and right to find a way out, but the only means of escape was a narrow hallway. On one end was me trapped in an alcove, on the other was them waiting, poised and ready to take me out with one pull of the trigger. Running out of options, I retreated back into the bathroom and locked the door. Without gun or prox, I was trapped. My plans of late night studying had now become plans of escape. Granted I wasn’t actually being hunted down, nor was it truly a matter of life or death, but rather a game of assassins. The game is relatively simple: You are given a water gun and a target to surprise and shoot, while avoiding others assigned to shoot you. When you kill someone, you acquire their target until only one person remains. Despite it sounding extremely silly and ridiculous, it is much easier to get caught up in the moment than you’d think. Faced with limited options, the bathroom window was left as my last option. Something I would have never done under almost any other normal circumstance suddenly became a relatively simple and logical choice. I jumped. As I fell out the bathroom window (which was only really a 2 foot drop), sprinting in a t-shirt and jeans through the snow and back to my dorm room, luckily finding someone kind enough to prox me back into the building, I felt a sense of liberation. Maybe it was the end-of-semester apathy or maybe it was exhaustion from a long week, however, it was nice to forget the stresses and pressures of daily student life. Often times at Princeton, it is easy to feel like the weight of the world is on our shoulders. Whether it is that pset due for class the next day, that obligation to attend an hour-long meeting or attending office hours in order to do well in class, life can sometimes feel extremely burdensome. And when we let it build up, the feeling of being overwhelmed comes up easily. However, one of the greatest things I’ve discovered on campus is probably the most counterintuitive to the work-oriented goal of college: Taking a break. There are so many wonderful things that happen on campus, both planned events run by the school and student groups, and non-planned ones that happen among friends. Sometimes we get so caught up that we forfeit opportunities to see that visiting lecturer or go see a Fuzzy Dice show, opting to put work first. Granted work is important, and I’m not suggesting that one should ignore it completely. However, when we place work as our sole priority, it slowly chips away at us. We become unhappier as we have to sacrifice more and more for our academic pursuits. Sometimes spontaneously stopping and enjoying ourselves can be good for us too. Unlike planned breaks, which we anticipate for weeks and often happen off campus, spontaneity on campus allows us to not only relax with friends, but also are much more enjoyable. By the sheer virtue of being unexpected, the experiences become memorable ones. Whereas planned breaks are the result of a final push after a block of concentrated work, random breaks are a surprise, giving us little time to form expectations or preoccupations. More importantly, it can even make us more productive. After spending hours studying, taking a quick 15 minute break and then resuming work will often be so much more productive than trying to push through it and straining ourselves out in the process. Some of the great memories I have made on campus have been from the spontaneous ones, where I decided to forgo my plans in order to spend more time with friends and having fun. Because 50 years from now, it’ll be stupid memories of me trying to jump out of the bathroom window, rather than staying up late to finish that pset that I will continue to remember. In the end, a night of potential productivity rapidly digressed into a night of ridiculous escape plans and other shenanigans. But maybe that’s not something to be ashamed of but rather something I should occasionally strive for and embrace.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn.

52336|~|Keep Princeton tax exempt|~|   December 11 2013|~|Column | Dec. 11 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Benjamin Franklin once said, “If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead, either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.” Allocating $120,000 in her will to sue “corrupt” educational institutions, it seems that Eleanor Lewis took his advice seriously. Ms. Lewis, who passed away recently, asked in her will that the money she left behind be used to fund a lawsuit against Princeton University on the claim that it is a corrupt institution. Granted that sometimes the words “privileged,” “detached” and even “elitist” may come to mind when one thinks of Princeton; “corrupt,” however, definitely raises a few eyebrows. Yet her premise does not seem so far-fetched. While the whole lawsuit is varied and complex, addressing multiple issues including the usage of University buildings for supposedly “commercial” purposes, the basic premise is that the school is a for-profit institution and thus does not deserve tax-exempt status. In particular, the lawsuit targets the University’s patent royalty sharing policy. In the past decade alone, Princeton has received over $524 million from a patent on Alimta, an effective drug invented by Princeton professor Edward Taylor in 2004, used for treating certain types of lung cancer. With such a large amount of profit, it is easy to see why local residents would think it’s fair that the University shoulder more of the local tax burden. The plaintiffs of the case argue that they allegedly pay “at least one-third more in taxes” as a result of the school’s current tax exemptions. They are not claiming that the University isn’t entitled to a part of the cuts. After all, the school provided the facilities, backing and materials needed for such research to be conducted in the first place. The real question is whether or not this money should be taxed. As plaintiff attorney Bruce Afran argues, “If they wanted to act like a traditional university, they would put the patent into the public domain and let everyone benefit from it equally.” If not, he adds, the University should register as “a commercial entity and need to pay their taxes like any other commercial entity.” When dealing with the town-gown relationship, questions naturally arise over whether Princeton’s educational purpose warrants the burdens placed on local taxpayers through tax exemptions. Expanding this to say that tax exemptions can be justified on grounds of being innovative or trying to benefit human health and society appears to set a dangerously ambiguous precedent. In response to criticisms, the University cites the Bayh-Dole Act, which allows universities to own patents on intellectual property. However, I think the patent system can be justified on more than just legal grounds. The money is linked to the University’s ability to provide quality education. Although Princeton does make a lot of money, it is important to keep in mind that the University is not aimlessly working toward good, but rather is a societal institution aiming to educate. It is undoubtedly a state interest to have an educated citizenry, and universities play a crucial role in fulfilling that need. The plaintiffs argue, however, that this aim has been tainted through the profits Princeton has made off of patent royalties. It would seem that Princeton is not prioritizing its money properly, citing increases in faculty salaries. Yet, this money also goes toward other ends. The most direct effect is Princeton’s generous financial aid program, which helps many who could not otherwise pay the school’s costly tuition. The average financial aid award for the Class of 2017 was almost $42,000. With a class size of 1,291 students, the University spends about $54,220,000 on freshmen alone. The money spent to help eliminate financial hurdles that might otherwise prevent middle- and lower-class students from attending is undoubtedly a worthy use of the school’s resources and seems to fit its mission of education. Princeton should strive to assist those who want to attend the school but are not able to due to financial circumstances beyond their control. After all, is it really a student’s fault that his parents do not have the funds to send him on their own? Pouring resources into making education affordable for all definitely fits under the University’s educational mission. While Princeton is able to pay for some of its financial aid through alumni contributions and federal aid, it cannot rely on outside help to carry such a burden. It is through patent royalties, which on face seem profit-seeking, that allow the University to create an educated public that is more determined by merit than class. Granted, the University should perhaps spend more of the money it receives through royalties to accomplish this goal and less on other ends, and its admission process is not flawless in terms of acquiring a perfect representation of the American public by class in its student bodies. However, this is no reason to tax the University if it is at least working toward this worthy goal.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu. 
52392|~|Different hues|~|   December 11 2013|~|Column | Dec. 11 |~|Prianka Misra|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|I think if you ask anyone on campus if Princeton is diverse, you would hear a resounding “yes.” It’s not easy to overlook the multitude of student organizations we have here that embrace cultural affinities: the Chinese Students’ Association, South Asian Students’ Association, Black Student Union and the Taiwanese-American Students’ Association immediately come to mind. When you come to Princeton, you can join Mas Flow, Naacho, Ballet Folklorico, Triple 8 or a number of other cultural dance groups. You can sing in Umqombothi, V-Tone, Kindred Spirit or Koleinu as you choose. If you want to be a part of any of these groups, you can take your pick and affirm an identity. So then why was I surprised when the Carl A. Fields Center sponsored an event called “My Princeton,” designed to embrace diversity and shared the voices of myriad students from a variety of groups and cultural backgrounds? Probably because it was one of the first events I had seen that allowed students to come together, rather than promoting the unique attributes of one specific group. Sure, there are plenty of talks about ethnicity and diversity. But how many events put these concepts into practical application and actually showcase what students from each group are really doing? The busy schedule of a Princeton student does not allow us to stay up-to-date on the great things that each affinity group does, so this type of cultural expose (that doesn’t use food as its main marketing strategy  like the TASA Night Market) is crucial to a greater understanding of Princeton’s eclectic array of cultural happenings. Granted, the primary goal of an affinity group is not only to introduce itself and its traditions to the greater Princeton community, but also to provide activities for its own members. I believe the internal and external aspects of these groups are equally important. But how do biracial students feel? Or those who come from two faiths? Or someone who doesn’t quite fit into any of these affinity groups at all? Even if they are welcome to join any of these groups, it’s certainly not fair to make people choose one over another. Just as we don’t define our identity in one way, we shouldn’t have to use one group to showcase who we are. There need to be more opportunities, student groups and events that embrace who we are on the whole, not just in pieces. But at Princeton, we don’t have a lot of events that encourage us to bring all of these identities together, to embrace a greater spirit of diversity. We have plenty of ways to side with one (or two, or possibly three) religious or racial aspect(s) of ourselves,  but we must do so on separate planes. The Carl A. Fields Center is dedicated to equality and understanding and seeks to “create and promote a sense of belonging that permeates throughout all aspects of the Princeton community” and “foster [its] growth and unity,” but does it really? In my opinion, it mostly provides a venue for groups to showcase their own individual work — SASA’s Diwali Eid Banquet, for example, does not incorporate the traditions of any other group. How easy is it for them to pair up with Pehchaan (the Muslim Students’ Association), Princeton Hindu Satsangam or the Asian American Students’ Association to collaborate? And how often is this encouraged? CSA’s Around the World event seems to get at this idea of clumping together, but I’m imagining these kinds of events on a much larger scale. They should be promoted campus-wide and should target faculty, graduate students and greater Princeton community members as well. In high school, I was part of a group called the Diversity Council. Even though we had a small student body, we were constantly focused on having discussions, fundraisers, and events that promoted diversity — which means, in my opinion, celebrating every facet (not just one or two or three) of every individual. I would love to see a model like this at Princeton, that understands the truly intricate meaning of diversity. On one hand, this means reaching out to those of other backgrounds, and collaborating with them to foster a greater sense of understanding of what each group does. On the other, promoting diversity means seeing people as more complex than mere embodiments of one identity group or another. I think that if we really think hard about what it is that defines each one of us culturally, we’ll see that we aren’t just one shade of human. We each have so many hues, and we need to let them mix together.|~|Prianka Misra is a sophomore from Castro Valley, Calif. She can be reached at pmisra@princeton.edu. 
52315|~|'What'd you do to get into Princeton?'|~|   December 11 2013|~|Column | Dec. 11 |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Staffing a historical committee at PMUNC, Princeton’s high school Model United Nations tournament, this past weekend, I inevitably got asked some pretty weird questions by the delegates of my 14-person Berlin Conference simulation. “Can the delegation of Belgium stage a democratic revolution to overthrow the King so that I don’t have to vote for this treaty?” “Can you look up some stats on the weapons manufacturing industry in Denmark in the 1880s for me?” “Is it OK for me to reference ‘Heart of Darkness’ even though it wasn’t written until 50 years after this conference?” By far though, the most awkward questions weren’t about the conference. They were the unavoidable questions about college admissions, especially since about two-thirds of the members were either high school juniors or seniors. After some of the committee sessions, delegates would come up to ask me or my chair what our top-choice schools were, what to say in an alumni interview or to recite the list of colleges to which we applied and got accepted. The question that surprised me the most of these though was, “What’d you do to get into Princeton?” When he first asked me, I tried to reconcile the standard feelings that the question elicits: Scrambling to try to say something super impressive-sounding and inadequacy in wondering why I even belong at Princeton. Trying to avoid attempting to answer a question I obviously don’t have an answer to, I asked the delegate to be more specific and a few minutes later found myself having to list my SAT scores and high school leadership positions. After a while, I realized that it’s probably better not to think about questions like these, and more importantly, that it’s probably better not to know the answers. In not knowing why I got accepted to Princeton, what specific accomplishment or impressive-sounding recommendation put me ‘over the edge’ in the admission committee meeting, I don’t feel defined by any single accomplishment. While it’s probably not the case for the majority of students, for some, there very well may be that one special accomplishment that almost single-handedly got them into Princeton. For me, not feeling like I have an easy answer to “Why are you here?” makes me instead feel that I don’t have a mantle to uphold in any specific area and can have some flexibility in my choices. I didn’t win the Intel Science Award, I didn’t manage a gubernatorial campaign and I’ve never been nominated for a Grammy. As such, I don’t feel that I have some unbelievable standard to live up to, in one very concentrated area. For most people applying, past a certain point of grades, accomplishments, extracurriculars, etc. the admission decisions are effectively a lottery system, and the decision cannot be solely accredited to one individual thing. Not knowing why my admission letter began with “Congratulations!” is also motivating. On some level, a bit of insecurity is a good thing. To put a positive spin on it, “insecurity” can simply mean feeling like I have to “earn my place.” I don’t at all feel like I’m entitled to be here or that my accomplishments make my presence here an inherent right. It would be quite easy for Princeton to find another me; in fact, probably hundreds of people who had the same qualifications, interests and background as me applied to Princeton (as a white male from New England who went to private school and wants to be a Wilson School major, I’m literally positive this is true). It makes me work harder and incentivizes me not to give anything less than a full effort, even despite the crushingly busy schedule we all face. In not knowing that I got accepted only because of one particular accomplishment, which I would obviously feel obliged to continue and live up to, I have a freedom to try new things. If I had won an Intel Science Prize, I would feel guilty being a comp-lit major. Had I started a multi-national charity that runs schools for orphans in some impoverished country, I would feel guilty giving it up to pursue a club sport I’d never tried. But I didn’t. So when a high school kid asks me what I did to get into Princeton, I could list off the grades and scores I got or the extracurriculars I did and led, but I think now that I’d proudly say that there was no one thing that got me here. Instead I would advise that student to present himself honestly, and not try to be a superstar at the expense of cherished interests. Because as I now know, there’s at least some space open at Princeton for people who are still waiting to make their mark.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

52152|~|Rejecting complacency|~|   December 10 2013|~|Column | Dec. 10 |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|It’s been discussed and debated countless times within the past few decades. This very newspaper has published an ample amount of editorials concerning it. And I, privileged and protected by my middle-class American upbringing, began to push the issue out of mind, attributing it to the lingering prejudices of the generation before mine. I thought the gay rights movement was on the brink of victory, with other LGBTQ groups following close behind. The statistics (70 percent of those aged 18 to 32 supporting same-sex marriage) made it seem as if the attitudes were already won and that the laws would inevitably be penned. Even as a member of the LGBTQ community, I considered stories of brutal beatings and other hate crimes far removed from my own experience. Princeton has an LGBT center, as do many other universities, but I presumed that they mostly dealt with support issues  such as coming out, self-acceptance or the occasional homophobic slur or joke. I recognized that strong anti-gay sentiments still existed in America, but the last place I ever expected to find them was in the country’s most prestigious university, among some of the nation’s most intellectually gifted students. And yet the weekend before Thanksgiving, I was suddenly made aware of how much — despite the LGBTQ community’s recent triumphs — must still be fought for, even here at Princeton. The line outside a crowded Terrace the Saturday before last had degenerated into more of a mobbed clump, with me somewhere in the middle and waiting to get in. Over my left shoulder I heard some homophobic, derogatory remark — seemingly directed at no one in particular — accompanied by laughter, which I assumed was simply a joke made in bad taste. Next thing I knew, though, I felt someone dragging me down by the back of my collar. I turned to see an arm, and then a leg, thrust behind my knees to expedite my fall. A heated exchange between us, his friends quickly pulling him back, a word to the bouncers to keep him out, and then I was inside. At the time, I was furious that the assault was not only unprovoked but also blatantly purposeful.  It wasn’t until later in the week that I guessed the mystery student’s motive. As I recounted the story to a friend, still indignant that I had done nothing to prompt the incident, he fit the pieces together for me. I had experienced, for the first time in my life, a seriously negative reaction to my sexuality. It’s never my intention to broadcast my sexual orientation, as I assume it’s never most people’s, but I would be lying to myself if I pretended there weren’t any indications of it in my style or mannerisms. This particular night, I wasn’t exactly the epitome of heterosexual with my unbuttoned Henley and my studded loafers. That, coupled with the offensive comment I half-heard right before I found a hand on the back of my collar, provided a likely explanation for why I was the target of this drunken man’s violent outburst. Aside from a few cuts on my neck from my chain, I emerged from the confrontation with no real injury. Drunken man “X” did give me valuable food for thought, however. After asking around, I discovered that, although not common, confrontations such as mine were not as rare as one would hope; hints of homophobia exist behind the scenes on the Street and on campus. The LGBTQ community is not as accepted by our generation as I believed, and dangerous manifestations of homophobia have not been entirely stamped out in even the most young and educated spheres of our society. To be frank, I am astounded. And I am embarrassed by Princeton. When the national number of those in our age group supportive of diverse sexual orientations is as high as 70 percent, the student body at an institution such as Princeton should virtually be universal in its endorsement of sexual diversity. With entire classes devoted to discussing the de jure social liberations of race and gender and the continued struggle for de facto equality, I am surprised any form of unsubstantiated hate could persist. And while I am confident that such sentiments are not prevalent on campus, they are less tempered than I believed. There is still a fight to be won. Our student body cannot fall into the same mindset of complacency that I held. Princeton’s administration and LGBTQ center have implemented the necessary policies to promote sexual orientation equality, but the actual revolutions of attitude must originate within the students. We must be actively aware of our peers and their prejudices and, instead of tolerating hatred, educate and inform against it. Homophobia has no more sound of a foundation to lean upon than racism or sexism, and as a progressive and innovative student body, we can ensure that no form of discrimination, whether within ourselves or within our friends, is allowed to remain standing.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

52100|~|Listen to more live music|~|   December 10 2013|~|Column | Dec. 10 |~|Kinnari Shah|~|   Columnist     |~|Duke Ellington once said, “There’s two kinds of music: good music … and the other kind. I like both.” When I first came to campus four years ago, Duke and I disagreed. I thought good music had died around here and only the bad was left. It took some time before I was proven otherwise. But I was. The amount of live music alone on this campus is amazing. It’s something that not every other place has. Not enough of us take advantage of that. I certainly didn’t during my first two years here. Then, for a while, a show or two was a given in my weekly schedule. It wasn’t until the past summer that I realized how lucky I was to have that. You see, Houston only has three types of radio stations: country, Spanish and popular rap/R&B. There was one other good station, curated by “The Original Sinbad,” who swore jazz was the only true art form, but I could only catch that from time to time. For three months, in a car with no AUX port, this was all I could listen to during my commute. In the beginning, I didn’t care for it. But if there was one piece of information I remember from social psychology, it’s that if you listen to a song seven times you start to like it, even if you started out hating it. Or maybe it was 22 times. Who cares? The point is that by the end of the summer I loved that Kanye West kind of music (including “Bound 2″). I knew all the lyrics to all of these songs when they came on the radio. I made a playlist. Then I came back here. Within two weeks, I deleted that playlist. It’s not that I don’t still like “Bound 2.” But with all the good musical taste and all the live music around here, I just didn’t ever feel like listening to it. It wasn’t my first choice of something to pick up and listen to. It wasn’t my second, third, fourth or fifth either. Watching your own musical taste change right in front of you is a surreal experience. What changed? What’s different about here? One good part of this campus is all the live music we get. Apart from people pushing good music into my face, my weekly dose of live music is what I missed the most during those three months in Houston. We are surrounded by live music. We are surrounded by live music and by friends. Take advantage of that. Go to see the orchestra. Go to an arch sing. Go see your friend’s band play. Go actually listen to the band playing on a Thursday night when you’re out. One night last week, I was out until 3 a.m. listening to a band. I was standing three feet away, watching the keyboardist lift his Yamaha into the air, still playing, and slam it back down. I wasn’t standing. I was dancing. Not bumping or grinding or swaying but dancing, surrounded by friends moved to pure, ecstatic motion by the music. Real instruments were abound, live, crooning all around. By the end of the night, the band left, and we only yelled after them for more. This is the way I wish I spent more of my time here: listening to good live music, surrounded by good people I know. It is unlike anything else. I didn’t realize how spoiled I was by good, talented, interesting music, coming from both inside and outside of campus, until I didn’t have it for three months. I didn’t realize how spoiled I was by people so willing to go listen to live music any night of the week until I didn’t have it. Drag your friends out. Go listen to more good live music. I promise you won’t regret it.|~|Kinnari Shah is a chemical and biological engineering major from Washington, N.J. She can be reached at kmshah@princeton.edu. 
52110|~|Fulfilling our admissions promise|~|   December 10 2013|~|Column | Dec. 10 |~|James Di Palma-Grisi|~|   Columnist     |~|Princeton does a pretty good job extending financial aid to students. It also has a fairly strong record of nominal diversity — racial, ethnic and economic — in recent history. Several of its institutions, from the admission department to eating clubs, have been shamefully late in treating humans equally, but all are presently up to speed, at least nominally. How these groups are treated once on campus could fill several books or theses, but let’s focus on academic preparedness. Having taken its place at the table of modern enlightenment, our institution suffers a common problem — in extending an offer of admission to all comers, there are practical differences in admitted students’ preparation that persist through all four years of study. A proportion of students enter Princeton with years of specialized training — from intensive summer camps, research experience, advanced tutoring and more. Our generous and varied concentration structure means that even informal proficiency in cultures or languages can represent an essentially fair but nonetheless real structural advantage. Most students have a mix of formal and informal preparation, so how should we ensure that all students can pursue their concentration of choice?  Here are four propositions for reconciling the implicit goal of practically allowing each student access to each concentration with the reality of differences in preparation. The main argument is for sufficient preparation across secondary schools. Preparation through calculus alone would, technically speaking, prepare students for the mathematics department (though some experience with real analysis would be preferable — here enters specialized training). Experience differentials can be seen across STEM fields — since calculus is a precursor for the engineering concentrations, which must be chosen by the end of the first year, this precludes a substantial number of students. By contrast, training in English and history form the building blocks of the social sciences, all of which have 100-level introductory courses for which no prior specialized knowledge is assumed. Yet the reality is that many secondary schools in the United States — containing brilliant individuals to whom Princeton admission is offered — do not universally prepare students for all of these subjects. Second, Princeton should expand the Freshman Scholars Institute and have it track students across years. This is a relatively low-profile program which, on the surface, gets the balance exactly right. The program targets students from secondary schools without advanced coursework but also targets students enrolling in intensive humanities or sciences programs. The FSI is an example of active training, and it should be expanded across all four summers (starting before the freshman fall) and opened for students to access as they choose. Third, standardize and expand intensive double-load courses designed to build proficiency within a more limited time frame than usual. Toward this end, there should be double credit across new and existing options so students don’t incur a course deficit while taking an equivalent workload. For the case of “TurboGreek,” which covers two semesters of Ancient Greek in one semester, the option lets students consolidate and concentrate their respective workloads. It also lets students backtrack and cover a year’s worth of Greek in the spring semester — and a nontrivial number of students discover their academic interests after the first semester. Fourth, promote “boot camps” and open them to all students. A “boot camp” is an informal course taught in the summer before a fall graduate course designed to prepare entering graduate students for coursework for which they may be intellectually but not practically qualified. Currently, undergraduate students taking graduate courses are invited to participate, but that seems fairly late in the academic life cycle and generally contingent on registration in a graduate course. It stands to reason that a proportion of undergraduates would not register for these courses but would benefit from the workshop format and the training. The elephant in the room is self-perception. To benefit from these programs, a student has to feel comfortable approaching — and admitting — the possibility that the stellar record which contributed to admission has a limited impact on future expected performance. Part of this is by design, since our shift-the-goalposts grading policy can create an environment in which the student feels deprived of benefits accrued by very similar individuals. Part of that, in turn, is the result of the academic life cycle — more experienced students tend to score more highly than less experienced students in the same courses. An anecdote on academic life cycles: mine. I received an abysmal grade in both introductory neuroscience courses and scored above the median in the introductory graduate neuroscience course three years later. It gets better — usually. Now imagine the psychological trap mentioned above starting before the first lecture through real and perceived structural differences. Imagine it persisting through a seemingly indifferent or, in the cases outlined above, nonexistent support structure. Most importantly, imagine it not being resolved, as it generally is through experience and specialization, but instead persisting over four years. Imagine constantly playing catchup on company time instead of taking a summer to recuperate through a targeted program. It’s not fun, and it doesn’t always end.|~|James Di Palma-Grisi is a psychology major from Glen Rock, N.J. He can be reached at jdi@princeton.edu. 
51910|~|Reclaiming the tools of technology|~|   December 9 2013|~|Column | Dec. 9 |~|Lauren Davis|~|   Columnist     |~|“But lo! Men have become the tools of their tools.” -Henry David Thoreau It is now abundantly clear that we need to do something to manage the role of technology in our lives. It’s no longer news that mounting bodies of research across the psychological and social sciences support our gripes of feeling constantly distracted by Facebook and overwhelmed by email. Along with all the benefits of connectedness, speed and convenience that modern devices — namely, laptops and smart phones — have brought us, come significant human costs. As a generation, we are now more distracted, anxious and fearful of being alone than ever before. The very same technology that was supposed to make us happier has subversively begun to do the opposite. The history of technological development reflects our society’s constant drive for more speed, efficiency and equality for all. These aims are not mal-intentioned, but the result has been a series of technologies — such as radios, phones, television and now the Internet and laptops — which are taxing on the mind and erode our sense of peace, calm and inner solidity. As William Powers wrote in his book “Hamlet’s BlackBerry: Building a Good Life in the Digital Age,” “We’re physical creatures who perceive and know the world through our bodies, yet we now spend much of our time in a universe of disembodied information … At a very deep level of the consciousness, this is arduous and draining.” I could easily go on for pages describing instances in my own life when face-to-face interaction has lost out to texting and instant messaging, and too much time spent on my laptop has caused my mind to become frazzled and overwhelmed, to the detriment of my quality of work and my well-being. However, instead of harping on and on about the problem, it’s time to think more actively about solutions. As Powers suggested, we need to focus more on the inner, human dimensions to technology, if we want to reclaim control. We need to ask ourselves how our devices are affecting us and our individual experiences; how they are altering how we think and feel, changing the rhythms of our day and affecting our work and social lives. It is from answering these questions that solutions might present themselves — solutions that can allow us to boost our productivity and ability to relax and to deepen our relationships with ourselves and other people. So, what can we do? In his book, Powers suggested a variety of techniques that could easily be adapted to Princeton’s campus. The most compelling idea he had was that of “Walden zones” — named for the pond Thoreau retreated to in his escape from the encroachment of the modern world — which are simply rooms where no screens of any kind are allowed. Powers initially conceived of them as rooms in houses, but I think we could create Walden zones around campus, in libraries or in Frist Campus Center that require people to turn off and store their devices in a cabinet outside. It would give more of us the excuse and the external reinforcement to do what we often try to but fail to do by ourselves: Put down the phone and just spend some time quietly thinking and writing alone or talking with friends without any other distraction. Such rooms would not only be beneficial for the quality of our work, but also our social relationships due to the elimination of the constant connectedness and psychological tug of wireless technology. Another idea of Powers’, which admittedly would be far harder to implement, is the idea of instituting a culture-wide Internet Sabbath for one day a week (or, frankly, even just a few hours on a Sunday). Imagine if, for an agreed-upon period of time, everyone agreed to leave email unanswered, phones unchecked and purely live in the moment without screens for entertainment or distraction? Part of the pressure that technology puts upon us is the burden that at every moment, we might be missing out on something — whether a message from a professor or a friend. But a culture-wide agreement could help us to escape that nagging sense of needing to check, just for a day, or an hour. Obviously, everyone has busy lives and assignments that need to be done. But perhaps knowing that the Internet was not always available would force us to become more efficient, rather than wasting away the hours only half-focusing on a task. Another easy solution could be that more professors require that students take notes by hand, instead of using laptops. I have had several experiences like this in classes, and all have been totally positive: I remembered the information better and felt more engaged and interested throughout the lectures. Even outside of class, we could all try turning off our phones for a couple of hours each day and see how much our perception of the world changes and how much more alive we are to what is happening in front of us, rather than what is happening in the abstract world of electronic information. I think it’s time to move away from simply complaining about how technology has taken over our lives and take some steps to reclaim it. We are not the tools of our tools.|~|Lauren Davis is a philosophy major from London, England. She can be reached at lhdavis@princeton.edu. Lauren Davis is a philosophy major from London, England.

51978|~|Untarnishable|~|   December 9 2013|~|Column | Dec. 9 |~|Prianka Misra|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|A few weeks ago, amid a flurry of news reporters prowling our campus in a frenetic mission to share our story of meningitis with the world, I saw a tour crossing in front of Nassau Hall. At first, I was surprised to find out that people were still touring the school. Weren’t they just as scared as the rest of us? But then I realized that the news about meningitis would not have stopped my family a few years ago. As a Californian family interested in visiting prestigious East Coast schools, almost nothing would have stopped us from visiting. An outbreak of meningitis — a deadly disease — would not have stopped my parents from encouraging me to apply here. Watching this tour amble by as if the news vans were invisible, I realized my family wasn’t the only one that thought this way. At the time I saw this tour, no news of a vaccine had been released. These visitors had no clue how long such an epidemic would last or whether it would have a significant impact on the safety of all students. But that didn’t seem to hinder them. Maybe it was because all of Princeton’s recent safety risks — meningitis, bomb threats, shooting scares — aren’t exactly Princeton’s fault. But what about things that our school can be blamed for? For all the hype about Susan Patton, our reputation has gone largely unscathed. Harvard’s cheating scandal has been the brunt of much ridicule, but will people stop applying to Harvard because of it? Dartmouth’s hazing abuses have received national attention as well, and Yale’s failure to suspend students found guilty of sexual assault has brought similar negative press. What about the COMBO survey that came out last April, which suggested that almost half of Princeton students report feeling depressed?  These kinds of outrageous events and statistics come out at all top-tier universities, but in the long run, their reputations as model academic institutions do not suffer an extreme beating. People still view Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth as great places to send the best and brightest students. Kids in high school still dream of being here. One could make the argument that these incidences are not representative of our schools, and so they shouldn’t have a severe impact on the way these campuses are viewed by the greater public. But these shocking facts should at least give us pause. It’s disconcerting that entire networks of people are somewhat blindly encouraging students to pursue academic careers in places that might otherwise be deemed unsafe and unfitting, given a different pre-existing reputation. I, like most of my peers, love Princeton. To use a bit of what I learned from SOC 101: Introduction to Sociology my freshman year, I don’t think that a few “bad apples” should taint the barrel. But at the same time, I don’t think we should forget the situationist theory either — there are certain aspects of high-pressure environments, which could be found at any of the schools I mentioned, that might correlate with these kinds of behavioral results. When we’re stressed and overworked to a level that stretches us thinner than ever before, our attitudes and actions can change. We can begin to do things that are completely out of character, completely different from how we normally would behave. Our campus context may play a bigger role than we think. Sadly enough, others outside our gates may choose to let their eyes, green with envy and ivy, overlook such crucial factors in our reputation.|~|Prianka Misra is a sophomore from Castro Valley, Calif.

51904|~|Drawing blanks and buzzwords|~|   December 9 2013|~|Column | Dec. 9 |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|Princeton students never seem to fail to dazzle board members of clubs or job interviewers with their impressive resumes and laundry lists of commitments. However, once asked to discuss their interests in the field and to showcase what they know about current national and global events relevant to the position or organization they’re interested in, many students seem to struggle. In an interview for a public health-related club on campus, I found that my interviewees often managed to find some new health policy, a medical society census or national health concern to name-drop. However, when it came time for the interviewee to demonstrate their understanding of the implications of the policy or what their opinions were, I found myself in the midst of a lot of awkward standstills. This is a fairly troubling aspect of Princeton’s culture. We’re supposed to be informed students, training to be contributing members of society and perhaps even leaders of tomorrow. However, it seems as though many of us are only equipped with a few buzzwords and cultural phrases that seem to imply that we know more than we do — enough to get us through a job interview but not enough to contribute to the academic community as insightful and well-informed scholars. How often do we see students picking up a copy of The New York Times or Washington Post alongside The Daily Princetonian, if they even choose to pick up a newspaper at all? How often do we see sporadic debates about culture, religion and politics outside of Whig-Clio and other similar student organizations? In her Oct. 9 column, “Skip the skimming,” Prianka Misra rallies for more sincere learning and an appreciative, rather than half-hearted, approach to our education at Princeton. Bad — albeit useful — habits such as skimming are only further exacerbated by huge workloads of reading and writing. What ends up happening is that students become experts at surface learning. Regrettably, students who are capable of developing insightful, detailed discussions on a focused topic, ranging from the philosophical to the mathematical, are repeatedly exposed to “condensed and watered-down versions of what we really should be learning.” You would think that many of us would be frightened at the prospect of going through so many courses and semesters here at Princeton without contributing anything substantial or meaningful to the conversation, but I rarely witness students stressing over this. Instead, I see students come unglued when they talk about the amount and difficulty of work that professors have assigned. They seem to spend hours during evenings and weekends cramming facts and figures with impressive speed. But to what end? To forget everything they’ve memorized the second the exam timer stops or the moment they leave the test-taking room? This excuse of “too much work” is not a legitimate scapegoat for not knowing other things beyond the scope of Princeton. If we excuse ourselves for knowing less than we should, then we prevent ourselves from doing as much as we should given the resources and opportunities that have been made available to us. Last year I attended a conference for a national organization with two other student representatives from the Princeton chapter. At the conference, I felt embarrassed. Not only did I not know as much about the organization, its history or mission as students from other universities, but my chapter also didn’t have as impressive a portfolio of contributions as many of these other university chapters. While they were churning out donations in the $20,000-30,000 range for their partner organizations in impoverished countries, my chapter seemed to struggle to reach $2,000. Other chapters had made strides in implementing grassroots health programs and consulting on local legislation reform, while we were still trying to get our peers at Princeton interested in what we do.  All I could do was wonder why. For a university with such prestige, such an abundance of resources and expert professors, where does this inability to participate and contribute come from? And is it really inability, or is it indifference, apathy and perhaps even a bit of irresponsibility? Do we make allowances for ignorance and inaction by blaming the idea of a closed-off Princeton bubble? Do we claim that we have too many assignments to keep up with daily news or do something influential and worthwhile? We should be concerned when students from “prestigious” universities such as Princeton start using prestige to place themselves at a higher standard and come to the conclusion that they don’t need to prove themselves, whether through knowledge or action. All this belief results in is action initiated by students who don’t believe that their university title should afford them any excuse from doing real work or making a real difference. Maintaining a pseudo-intellectual facade should be one of our greatest fears while we’re here. Perhaps the only way we can prevent this from happening is through recognizing that what we don’t know doesn’t reflect badly on our image of prestige and intelligence. It makes us available to receive knowledge that is both deep and accurate, so that when the time comes for us to do something, we won’t just be pulling buzzwords and blanks.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.

51781|~|Jagged little pill|~|   December 8 2013|~|Column | Dec. 8 |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|I have a friend whom I consider to be very popular on campus. People are always coming to visit him while he’s working, and he tends to be “in the know” about upcoming social events at a level that I cannot even begin to approach. One day, I noticed that he was a little bit quieter than usual. Because I saw papers scattered all around him, I initially assumed that he was working hard and had no time for distractions. But then, he stopped working, looked up at me, and said in a soft and unassuming voice, “I don’t know why I feel so lonely. It’s like no matter how much I do, I still feel like I’m not close to anyone really.” I consider myself to be able to comfort friends when they are upset, but I was speechless. I just looked at him with pity because I have been there before. I just never thought loneliness was a battle that he was struggling to overcome. Now I’m starting to observe people differently. How is it that a person can be heavily involved in a wide range of activities and be a constant fixture on the social scene, yet still feel lonely? I thought that if a person has connections in many different circles within the Princeton community, then he or she could always get in touch with someone at any time of the day. The probability for being able to meet up with people is much higher. But I tend not to think this way anymore. Friends who live in the same hall can go a week or even more without seeing each other. Dinner dates booked weeks in advance can suddenly be canceled an hour before the scheduled time. Inside the Orange Bubble, we all live in our own individual bubbles. We navigate our day-to-day lives based on meetings, classes, studying, eating and, for some of us, sleeping. Just because a person is well-known on campus through extracurricular activities does not mean that this person has a deeper connection to people that extends beyond planning conferences or study breaks or writing sponsorship proposals. At a basic level, we all just want someone to care about us. Someone who gets in contact with us for the sole purpose of asking how we are doing. At times this need is overlooked. But I’ll be the devil’s advocate and say that it’s not like the other person is making a conscientious effort not to ask about your mood; sometimes things are time-sensitive. People need to move quickly and sometimes this pace comes at the expense of others. The hookup culture has been one of the most controversial topics in recent years. I do not intend to take a position on it because everyone is entitled to either partake or refrain from this part of Princeton’s social scene. However, I have had several friends who actually despise themselves, not because they hooked up with other people and hated it, but because they could not be like everyone else and just enjoy it. Some people just don’t do well with transient interactions even when they force themselves to engage in them. Some people yearn for intimacy on a continual basis. I think that it is extremely difficult to confess to anyone — even yourself — that you are lonely. Often, the more you try to hide from it, the more jaded you become. You are conscious of your time and other people’s time, and that might influence you from ever reaching out to anyone on a more personal level. I will never know why my friend chose to share his feelings with me specifically, but I’m glad that he did. It made me wonder if there are others like him who feel the same way. I wonder if others sit down and spend exorbitant amounts of time trying to rationalize their feelings until they feel better about themselves. For instance, a person might ask, “Why do I feel lonely when there are countless events every day going on where I can meet people?” They can spend so much time trying to find the answer to “why” rather than trying to understand “how” he or she came to feel this way. Whatever it is, I know that my friend, as well as others, will make it through. But even so, the fact that the sentiment is there makes navigating this portion of life a jagged little pill to swallow.|~|Morgan Jerkins is a comparative literature major from Williamston, N.J.

51673|~|Fear of missing out|~|   December 8 2013|~|Column | Dec. 8 |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|As course selection draws near, I feel panic setting in. There’s this requirement and that distribution; I really wanted to take a class for fun, but there’s no space and no time. I look at ICE and see if I can still fit it in next year, but then there’s a whole slew of departmentals I’ve already entered in for next year’s schedule. I’m a first-semester sophomore. That means that three-eighths of my college career is over. By the end of this year, I’ll be half-done with college. That’s jarring to think about. It feels like I just walked through FitzRandolph Gate for the first time; in reality, that was over a year ago. Pretty soon, I’ll be closer to walking out of that gate than walking in it. When I think about the fact that college is going to end, and that it’s going to end so soon, regret hits me pretty hard. People say not to feel regret or feel the fear of missing out, but it’s so hard when you’re capable of making the most independent choices you’ve ever made in your entire life, and they’re thrown at you all at once. I didn’t research clubs before coming here, so I just joined a lot that I didn’t stick with. I got a single because I thought I would sleep a lot more than I did, so I didn’t have special roomie bonds that others do. Some classes I chose were right for me; some were not. I’m still not sure if my major is right for me, but indecision only seems to make the clock tick faster, until soon I will reach the point when it’s too late to switch. We choose whether to go to the Street or whether to stay in and do laundry and then live with the hangover or the Facebook pictures of what we missed the next morning. We decide whether or not to go on a service trip to Puerto Rico over the summer or work for Citigroup. We choose eating clubs that will funnel us toward certain friend groups. We choose whether to invest time in a college relationship or just wait it out until after graduation. Those decisions can mean everything, and the hardest part about making them is that every alternative is pretty good. Every eating club will have people you get along with, and every summer opportunity will offer you different benefits. You just don’t have the time to explore all of them. What exacerbates our regret is the fact that other people make those alternative choices and appear to be happy with them. The fear of missing out is definitely peer-induced. In a setting like Princeton, where there are limitless opportunities and proactive classmates who will pursue all different ones, it’s inevitable to feel regret. But it doesn’t mean that others are necessarily better off. It just means they’re different people. At some point, the fear of missing out results in pressure to do what everyone else is doing: If they’re all doing this, am I the one making the wrong choice? Am I missing out? This becomes a problem when it facilitates a herd mentality. We have a tendency to believe that we can “optimize” our lives if we make perfect decisions — if we choose the right major or the right extracurricular activities, we’ll be set for life. So to find out this mystical answer to the puzzle of what we “should be” doing, we look to fellow students. But life isn’t solely a result of decisions we make in college — it’s more malleable than that. And there is no uniformly optimal path. People say just to stop feeling the fear of missing out, but I think the root solution is just to stop thinking these choices are the only choices that will ever matter. Our lives are not made by “perfect” decisions that we make here. It’s not a once-and-you’re-done kind of thing. The decisions will go on and on and on, and the good thing about college is that it’s a time to try out different opportunities. We can get closer to knowing which decisions are right for us.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

51474|~|Two and a half languages|~|   December 5 2013|~|Column | Dec. 5 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|On Monday, Paul Phillips wrote an article for The Daily Princetonian on discrepancies in proficiency for students in introductory language classes at Princeton. Faculty in various language departments generally viewed such discrepancies as largely inconsequential in regard to issues of fairness in grading and course rigor. I have yet to take a foreign language course here at Princeton. However, I plan on taking KOR 402: Contemporary Korean Language & Culture II in the spring. And I am already feeling the familiar apprehension I felt every other day before Japanese class throughout middle and high school. It is this apprehension that led me to avoid enrolling in either a Korean or Japanese course this semester. My circumstances are different from those in introductory language classes who believe peers with more exposure to a language toughen the grading curve. The foreign language I studied not only in high school, but also throughout elementary and secondary school, was the language of the country I lived in. While students in the States were exposing themselves to languages such as Spanish or French for the first time in freshman year, I was enrolled in Japanese classes geared toward students who had been exposed to the language their entire lives. I found myself thrust into classrooms full of native speakers when I moved from Japanese as a Foreign Language to Japanese as a Native Language classes in middle school. I did relatively well in my classes and entered higher levels according to the recommendations of my teachers. For all intents and purposes, I was “proficient” in Japanese. Yet I found myself formulating sentence on whims and guesses more and more often; I had never grasped the basic grammatical rules. I floundered as I prepared each sentence in advance during classroom discussions, while my peers bounced ideas back and forth at a pace I couldn’t even begin to keep up with. Friends who had Japanese parents always teased me; I was often told I had a “Korean accent” when I spoke Japanese, though my Korean pronunciation is also moderately affected. Every morning, it took me two tries to utter the Japanese word for thank you, “arigato,” as I got off the bus — the initial “ah” sound always got stuck. I wasn’t learning a language in my Japanese classes. I was just trying to scrape by. My ambition to take higher-level courses led to a cursory understanding of Japanese, an ambiguous level of proficiency that is a source of shame and regret. I can relate to heritage speakers, as students with native exposure to foreign languages are called in Phillips’ article, who decide to take introductory classes here at Princeton. It isn’t just a matter of review; these students have much to gain from stepping back and filling in the gaps in their foundational knowledge — just as much, perhaps, as students experiencing the language for the first time. In many ways, first-time speakers and those who have only experienced a language outside the classroom have similar amounts to gain. Proficiency in a language can’t really be measured. There are placement tests and even official certificates that can roughly gauge one’s ability to communicate in a given language. However, so much goes into communication that cannot be quantified. One’s level of comfort and confidence, balance between writing and speaking ability, pronunciation, ability to think in the language — these are all components of communicating in a language that can’t be accounted for. A student’s ability to enjoy television in a foreign language can be just as valuable a gauge of their proficiency as any kind of sitting test. Perhaps it is unfair for beginners to have to compete against students with more exposure. However, it is perhaps more unfair for so-called hereditary speakers, who may never have had the chance to properly study the basic foundational components of a language, to not be given equal opportunity to learn. They deserve the benefit of the doubt. Students who are taking advantage of the placement system lose something so much more valuable than the GPA boost they gain. Those who truly wish to master a language have the right to decide which classes suit their needs and abilities without having to deal with the resentment and accusation of classmates who believe their own grades are jeopardized.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan.

51476|~|Editorial: Separate class governments from the Senate|~|   December 5 2013|~|Editorial | Dec. 5 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|On Dec. 8, the USG is planning to vote on a constitutional amendment that would formally separate the class governments from the Senate . The Editorial Board supports this amendment, as a more formal separation of the two bodies would accurately reflect the separate roles they play and the fact that one body is not superior to the other. Currently, the class governments and Senate operate as two branches of USG. The Senate focuses on campus-wide social events and policy improvements, while the class governments focus on providing class programming and promoting class spirit and unity. For example, the Senate focuses on events and issues such as Lawnparties and whether to have classes on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Class governments, on the other hand, are in charge of class study breaks and class attire. Occasionally, these two bodies work on projects together, and they communicate both formally and informally. An important aspect of the constitutional amendments is the formalization of USG structure; specifically, the amendment seeks to clarify the relationship between the Senate and the class governments. Currently, the Senate retains sole control of the ability to amend the constitution. This control includes the ability to alter the constitutionally mandated structure of the class governments. In addition to formally separating the two governing bodies, the proposed reforms would give the class governments the right to alter sections of the constitution that pertain to them, thereby limiting and clarifying Senate control of the structure of class governments. We believe these measures are prudent for two reasons. First, formally separating the bodies will likely clarify for students the distinct role each plays in campus governance and underscore the fact that the class governments are ultimately and primarily accountable to their respective classes. Secondly, because class governments are likely to know more than the Senate about the intricacies and difficulties of their job, it is logical to allow them to draft amendments to provisions of the constitution that affect their operation. Another issue highlighted in debates over the proposed amendments is that the Senate currently can censor class government projects and call up a class government representative for review — though this right is rarely exercised. This means that a Senate member from one class year, say 2016, could hypothetically influence the decisions of 2015’s class government. This seems troubling given that there is no inherent reason for class governments to be accountable to the Senate. Class governments should not have their class-specific projects influenced by the Senate. While completely autonomous class governments might raise some concerns, a second package of amendments would address autonomy and transparency issues. This amendment would require class governments to publish their budgets and project reports each semester. Currently, there is no requirement to do either of these things, which is disconcerting given the large sums of money spent by class governments each year. Formally separating the class governments from the USG may also foster a greater a sense of ownership and responsibility among class government representatives. Currently, many class government positions are not contested after freshman year. Increasing the transparency, responsibility and political capabilities of the class governments may encourage more students to get involved with their class government representatives. Such involvement would improve class governments through contested elections and increased input to representatives. Some have argued that, because amending the constitution necessarily affects the entire student body, participating in the amendment process is beyond the purview of class governments because their authority is limited to decisions relating to their specific classes. Significantly, even under the proposed amendments, the Senate would have to give final approval to constitutional amendments drafted by the class governments. Given this check, and considering that class governments are elected to best serve their specific classes, the Board does not believe that allowing class governments to draft amendments would have adverse consequences or is particularly philosophically incoherent. Ultimately, the Board believes that the proposed amendments would increase class governments’ transparency and allot them an autonomy that they deserve. We do not believe that the separation would complicate effective governance, as the two bodies could still work closely on joint projects. We therefore hope that the USG will act so as to separate its component branches and support the increased transparency of class governments.|~|Dylan Ackerman is recused due to his position as vice president of the 2014 Class Council. 
51468|~|The ideal Princetonian|~|   December 5 2013|~|Column | Dec. 5 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|None|~|Aaron: Before entering Princeton, I held an obscure image of what I believed to be the “ideal University student.” I imagined that once I arrived, I would be expected to participate unquestioningly in a social and academic community to which I was not accustomed. Some part of me imagined that to be a good representative of the school, I would need to repress my racial and economic identity. Initially, this possibility didn’t concern me because I suspected that my identity as an African-American from a lower middle class household wouldn’t matter as much as the more “important” qualities (virtue, moral sensibility, etc.) that would allow me to be a well-educated and useful member of society. As time passed, I began to realize that for many people, embracing one’s social identifiers was just as important as fostering a love for humanitarianism. The way I self-identified as a student and human being gradually transformed while the vision I had of the “perfect” Princetonian dissolved into something else entirely. Bennett: I hadn’t considered applying to any Ivy League school until my dad suggested Princeton after hearing about its financial aid program. I probably wouldn’t have applied without his prodding, since I, like Aaron, just didn’t consider myself “Ivy material.” I wanted to go to a small, quirky school, one where the qualities which defined the student body were deeper and more emblematic of the liberal arts than the racial, economic and, yes, familial connections which stereotypically defined Princeton and its peer institutions. Ironically, it was largely because these smaller schools tend to be quite expensive and unable to provide financial assistance that I ended up, nearly by accident, at Princeton. Aaron: After I learned that a scholarship organization had given me a generous financial aid package to attend Princeton, the news spread at my high school. Statistically, the match was unlikely. I am a Detroit-raised, African-American male who grew up in a single mother household. It was not uncommon for adults (usually of color) to commend my “defying the odds” tale. Among my friends and teachers, my race never came up as the reason for my academic success, and I didn’t think it defined my experiences as a human being. My high school had once paid for me to attend a national diversity conference in tenth grade, an opportunity that allowed me to acquire an appreciation for multiculturalism. However, I tended to ignore my own racial identity in the process of becoming a more cosmopolitan person. Bennett: I discovered over summer break that many suburban Coloradans can’t imagine one of their own going to Princeton. Whether the perceived divide be geographical, economic or based on intelligence or familial connection, people I meet back home will take my Princeton gear as indication that I am a visiting tourist. So, though my white, two-parent, suburban upbringing made the statistics on my acceptance somewhat less unusual than Aaron’s, there was still a sense that I’d beaten the odds by being accepted. I feared I would have to redefine myself in the new world Princeton represented. Since I could not expect to be defined as an achiever (as I had been in high school) among so many savvy, confident and accomplished students, I expected a single characteristic — perhaps “outdoorsy,” given my Colorado upbringing — to define my niche on campus. But rather than quash the intellectual identity that I so prized, being among so many high-achieving Princetonians allowed me to discover which particular aspects of my intellect were important to me and foster them in different aspects of my Princeton experience. The opportunity to explore my introspection through the ‘Prince,’ my craziness through the band and my scientific passion through ISC allowed me to discover divergent aspects of myself while learning from the diverse personalities I met in these communities. Aaron: I think recognizing the diversity of Princeton’s student-led cultural organizations was the first indication that I had ignored the importance of my racial identity for much of my life. After speaking with two members of the Black Men’s Awareness Group, I was surprised that I had expected these students to be solely concerned with their academic success. Here were two examples of young black Princeton men who were engaged in dialogues about their race. These were the “ideal” Princeton students: socially and culturally conscious individuals who also valued their academic success. In high school, I had never bothered to join the black awareness club because I thought it didn’t matter as much as getting into a good college. Now I attend school with some of the most passionate students in the country. To be a Princeton student is not to mold oneself around an abstract vision or reputation. Instead, it is to recognize one’s whole self and devote that person to the improvement of others. Bennett: Done properly, the essays we write for college applications force significant introspection and can cause all manner of personal revelations, but the materials we submit to the admissions office are just the beginning. If we can resist the temptation to mold ourselves into an abstract “ideal Princeton student,” we can create our own incarnation of such a student by presenting our unique passions and experiences to our peers and allowing theirs to shape us, not into a specific ideal, but into a unique and confident person.

51312|~|Letter to the Editor: Some facts about graduate student housing|~|   December 4 2013|~|Letter to the Editor | Dec. 4 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|I would like to clarify and correct some of the recent discussion in The Daily Princetonian about the University’s commitment to graduate student housing and the fate of the Butler Apartments. Providing graduate student housing is a priority for the University. (We provide much more than almost all of our peers.) When the University first announced plans to replace the Butler Apartments with the new Lakeside apartment complex, the news seemed to be welcomed by graduate students. I appreciate the attachment that many graduate students and alumni have to the Butler Apartments. However, the general deteriorating condition of these barracks-style housing units, which were first installed in 1947, became clear years ago. The complex was coming to the end of its useful life, despite continuing efforts to keep it patched together. Besides the high cost of frequent structural repairs, most of the units have gas-fired wall heating units and neither sprinklers nor smoke alarm systems connected to the Department of Public Safety. Among other challenges, most apartments do not meet federal guidelines for accessibility. In all, it was becoming neither feasible nor cost-effective to continue maintaining the complex. Given that reality and a desire to provide higher quality graduate student housing close to campus, a decision was made to construct new housing and discontinue the use of the Butler Apartments. This decision was made as part of a planning process that was initiated in 2004. My colleagues in the Graduate School office and I engaged graduate students in the planning process to shape the design of the Lakeside complex via student surveys and data gathered over a number of years. Two graduate students were part of the planning team, and the Graduate Student Government was involved at every stage of the planning process. The planners sought to identify the kinds of units most desired by graduate students and their families, while being sensitive to costs. In making comparisons, one should note that a two-bedroom unit at Butler (620 square feet) is smaller than a one-bedroom unit at Lakeside (649 square feet), which surveys repeatedly showed to be preferable for graduate student couples. The Lakeside one-bedroom will cost only about $90 a month more for rent and utilities than the Butler tract predecessor, while the increase for most shared units for single students will be even less. When Lakeside is ready and Butler is closed, the University will have the capacity to house 75 percent of eligible graduate students. This additional capacity was built into our planning to allow us to maintain our longstanding commitment to house 70 percent of eligible students for the next decade, even as our graduate student population grows over time. We will have more housing capacity than a decade ago, when the effort began to replace failing facilities, and substantially more than 20 years ago. Princeton graduate students will have more and better options than ever before. In addition to providing greater proximity to central campus and other graduate student housing, the Lakeside complex is designed to promote a sense of community, evidenced by amenities such as volleyball and basketball courts, a children’s play area and a community garden. The complex will also include a common lounge space, a fitness room, study spaces and a barbecue area. Pets will be welcome in many of the individual units and shared townhouses. Each unit will have a washer and dryer, and shared units will have multiple bathrooms. A new 504-space parking garage next to the complex will be available to graduate students and their guests. The new units will far surpass Butler in terms of quality, and they are being constructed in an environmentally friendly way, consistent with the University’s commitment to sustainability. When the Lakeside project is complete, graduate housing will be sitting on approximately 20 acres of on-campus land, representing a substantial investment by the University in graduate student housing. I know that many former Butler residents have fond memories of their time there, even as they recall the challenges of living in increasingly outmoded units originally intended for other purposes. My hope is that future residents of Lakeside will have equally fond memories of living in a community overlooking the lake, in units designed with them in mind and of a quality that provides accommodations that are safe, comfortable, convenient and affordable.|~|William B.

51273|~|A different policy for a different problem |~|   December 4 2013|~|Column | Dec. 4 |~|Rebecca Kreutter|~|None|~|I’ve been blared awake by a tripped fire alarm several times in the middle of night, been fined twice for propping my means of egress and learned during the fire talk of frosh week the dangers of contraband candles and unattached microwaves. When it comes to fire safety, like Jason, I don’t agree that every aspect of the regulations is necessarily worth the priority that the University gives it. Yet, I don’t agree that alcohol safety is “presented in a more lax light, based in large part on a policy of self-responsibility.” Yes, alcohol policy relies more on self-responsibility than the fire policy. After all, we don’t have alcohol inspectors that can come into our dorms without warning to dole out fines for specific unsafe behaviors. Contrary to Jason, I do not believe this policy of self-responsibility is “lax.” Instead, it is consistent with promoting student welfare. Jason implies that fire safety and alcohol safety are governed by the same principles and that what works in fire safety will work in alcohol safety. Top-down regulation makes sense for fire safety. With the exception of door propping, which has yet to convince students that the danger outweighs the convenience, most students learn after the first fine that candles, toasters and microwaves aren’t worth the penalty. It is hard to imagine a similar situation occurring if the University tamped down on alcohol in the dorms. After all, no one believes that prohibition of alcohol would prevent drinking; just ask the 18th amendment. Alcohol safety is more about moderation than prevention. We are college kids, not yet “real-world,” but no longer living at home. It makes sense that the University would educate us about safe alcohol use, but then leave us to make our own decisions and even a few of our own mistakes. Self-responsibility with alcohol use is recognition that each of us has the ability to control where and how the night takes us. Though everyone can do their part to reduce the risk of fires, fire safety is not subject to the same self-responsibility standards. A dorm fire, as unlikely as it is, can pose a threat to other students in the dorm; dangerous drinking contains the risk within the individual. This is not to say that high-risk drinking does not have high consequences for the individual. It can. Nor that the intoxicated do not occasionally harm property or other people. They do. Rather, the University does not have the same liability issues for students who drink. A comparison of the stats of fires at Princeton vs. referrals for liquor law violations neglects the fact that more students drink alcohol on a regular basis than light fires in their rooms. Though the goal of no high-risk drinking should always be the priority, we shouldn’t interpret alcohol stats as a failure on the part of the University to promote student safety. Princeton University’s alcohol policy balances safety with the realities of college life. The University acknowledges that not all drinking is bad; it is just some drinking behaviors that should be banned. It targets high-risk drinking, drinking from common sources, alcohol-induced disorderliness, pregaming and drinking games. Students have the resources to learn about alcohol safety during Frosh Week, alcoholEdu and zee group conversations. Residential college adviers go on rounds on the weekends and remain on-call throughout the night. The Street is open almost every weekend to students who can find a least a few clubs open to PUID. The Street is within walking distance — which means the University doesn’t need to prioritize designated driver education — and doesn’t serve hard alcohol during Street hours. Most importantly, students cannot get in trouble for being drunk or from needing medical instance and are required to take students who do need help to McCosh Health Center. The combination of these policies earned the University a B in terms of drug and alcohol policy from Students for Sensible Drug Policy. In particular, an open medical amnesty was a cornerstone to achieving a higher grade from SSDP. Consider the effect of a stricter alcohol policy. Completely banning alcohol, or more realistically banning underage students from the eating clubs, would likely only lead to higher-risk drinking in dorm rooms as pregames turn into THE game. Instead of reducing high-risk drinking, a top-down policy would almost certainly increase risk. I am fully aware that students still engage in high-risk drinking and that this risk should be minimized. I disagree that fire safety is over-prioritized at the expense of alcohol safety. Rather, the University’s alcohol policy does a good job of managing student risk while still allowing college kids to be college kids.|~|Rebecca Kreutter is a Wilson School major from Singapore, Singapore.

51295|~|Out of the frying pan and into the fire|~|   December 4 2013|~|Column | Dec. 4 |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The Princeton administration is undoubtedly dedicated to keeping its students as safe as possible. But in the process of pursuing policies that promote safety, it seems that the administration has chosen to unnecessarily emphasize some aspects of campus safety over others. Case in point: fire safety. According to the annual fire safety reports published by the Department of Public Safety, there was a single fire in campus residential housing in 2012, three fires in 2011, nine fires in 2010 (of which 4 occurred in the graduate student houses) and four fires in 2009. What’s more, over the course of 14 fires in four years, the only damage incurred to the University or its inhabitants was the damage of two microwaves. In contrast, take another activity that is commonly associated with a high incidence of college student injury or even death — high-risk drinking. According to P-Safe, on campus in 2012 there were 28 judicial referrals for liquor law violations and zero arrests; in 2011, there were 35 referrals and zero arrests; in 2010, there were 33 referrals and zero arrests; in 2009, there were 90 referrals and 10 arrests; and in 2008, there were 109 referrals and 10 arrests. Clearly, alcohol abuse is more prolific an issue on campus than is fire danger. Part of the reason that the numbers are so skewed might be attributed to the different rhetoric espoused by the administration in regard to the two aforementioned issues. During freshman orientation week, fire safety was introduced as a rigid, line-in-the-sand issue — if you broke a fire safety regulation, you were fined, end of story. Further, such regulations included violations like blocking or obstructing routes of egress, improperly using electrical cords, propping open doors or owning an unapproved appliance. In total, there are 20 such rules that must be obeyed, as well as fines ranging from $25 to $100 per violation. Of course, the rules aren’t entirely set in stone. But in order to, for instance, petition that an appliance be added to the “approved appliances” list, students must first “read the technical criteria” of said appliance, then “make an appointment” to bring the appliance to the manager of dormitories, all the while aware that “disassembly of the appliance may be required to examine it.” On the other hand, alcohol safety was presented in a more lax light, based in large part on a policy of self-responsibility. Indeed, Princeton’s alcohol policy reads “students are expected and encouraged to be aware of the social, physiological, psychological consequences and personal risks of excessive drinking in order to make responsible and informed decisions about the service and consumption of alcohol.” Emphasis of “personal risk.” That is not to say that P-Safe will not or does not crack down on alcohol violations (they explicitly prohibit students from serving hard liquor, for instance); they certainly do. But their actions do not entail random searches of dormitory rooms and are on the whole less intrusive or extreme as those of the fire safety program. From a national standpoint, approximately 3,800 university housing fires occur annually, according to the U.S. Fire Administration, and of those 3,800, 88 percent result from cooking fires (it is notable to point out that the majority of Princeton dormitories don’t have kitchens themselves). Further, according to the USFA, the fires cause “a yearly average of zero deaths and 25 injuries.” In contrast, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, “1,825 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 die from alcohol-related unintentional injuries, including motor vehicle crashes” and “599,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are unintentionally injured under the influence of alcohol.” Thus, low rates of fire safety issues nationwide indicate that the equally low rates of fire hazard incidence on campus are not necessarily a result of the excellence of our fire program, but rather a national trend. At the same time, the data indicates that alcohol-related incidents are, nationally, a much more prolific safety issue, just as it is at Princeton. Interestingly, since Princeton’s inception, fires have been responsible for major damage to University buildings on only six occasions — Nassau Hall in 1802 and 1855, Marquand Chapel and Dickinson Hall in 1920, John C. Green School of Science in 1928, University Gymnasium in 1944 and Whig Hall in 1969. In all six cases, which were the most severe instances of significant conflagrations to occur on campus property, no loss of life occurred, and only one injury was reported. It can be argued that we, being college students, are intrinsically more prone to get involved in alcohol related activities — after all, partying and drinking with friends is fun, lighting furniture on fire and staring into the flames is not. What’s more, it may be Fire Safety’s vigilance and strict adherence to rules that has allowed the University to remain unscathed from major fire damage. Thus, this is in no way an attempt to condemn the work that the University does to keep students safe on a daily basis. It just seems that there is at times a disjoint between the amount of resources and effort invested into policies like fire safety and the resulting benefit derived, in terms of students helped. Maybe it’s time the University re-evaluate its programs and its focus more heavily on other aspects of student safety.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

51112|~|The reasoning behind affirmative action |~|   December 3 2013|~|Column | Dec. 3 |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court took up the issue of affirmative action in the case Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, which attempted to decide whether the state of Michigan violated the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause when it amended its state constitution to ban affirmative-action programs in its universities and in the public sector. What has come to be known as the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative prohibits the use of racial, ethnic or sex-based preferential treatment in admissions considerations for public educational institutions, government contracting and public employment, thereby effectively prohibiting affirmative-action programs in any of Michigan’s public institutions. This brings to light the decades-old questions regarding the constitutionality of affirmative action. Is race-based affirmative action justifiable? Ought affirmative action be based on socioeconomic status? Should affirmative action be legal at all? To answer these questions, it is important to recognize the reasons that affirmative action exists in the first place. What I believe to be the primary and the only constitutionally sound reason is that having different sets of criteria for different segments of the population bolsters diversity. Diversity benefits members of a university community by giving more people exposure to a greater variation of human experiences and outlooks. Different types of people with different experiences have different outlooks on the world. That is a healthy dynamic to have in a setting where the goal is to understand humanity better and cleave closer to truth. Affirmative action is especially relevant in the university setting, where schools have fixed numbers of admitted freshmen and admission is a zero-sum game. If one student takes a spot, there is one less spot for everyone else. If grades and test scores are the sole metric for measuring success across all segments of society, there will be more homogeneous admittances. Those with fancy educations, leisure time and test preparation will fare better in the selection process. White people have statistically higher access to these privileged elements. Black people have (on the whole) less access. By giving different racial groups different sets of metric for achieving success, one is giving a more varied group of people access to higher education. Schools will be more diverse if different groups of people have slightly different sets of assessing criteria. The second reason to allow for, and even promote, race-based affirmative action is that it creates equality among the races. This seems counterintuitive, since it feels like a form of counter-racism against the privileged. It is, on an individual level. The equality that affirmative action bolsters is on a race level — as a class of people. This is termed “group-regarding” equality, versus “individual-regarding” equality. This distinction allows for any given individual to be discriminated against in favor of group equality. Black people are currently, even if unintentionally, discriminated against, and in order to raise them up as a people to have equal access, they must be treated as a unit. It makes sense for that unit to have a different set of criteria for university admission. Of course, there is a test-score meritocracy within the unit, but there is additional criteria introduced and that is, to put it bluntly, a certain melatonin level. A third and, I believe, less convincing reason to promote race-based affirmative action is rectification of historical discrimination — slavery, Jim Crow laws, etc. Yes, there was awful and consistent discrimination toward black people, but affirmative action, as a way of saying “sorry,” seems superficial. The eventual goal of affirmative action is to no longer need affirmative action, not to strengthen the institution for perpetuity. So why is race used as the central metric at hand, and not income? Basing affirmative action on socioeconomic status has many faults. The primary one is that it negates the crucial element of what the policy attempts to correct: race-wide discrimination. Socioeconomic affirmative action does not aid in increasing diversity in schools. Poor white people outnumber poor black people by nearly an order of magnitude (eight to 10 times). According to author Robert Bruce Slater in his article “Why Socioeconomic Affirmative Action in College Admissions Works Against African Americans,” poor white people also tend to outscore poor black people within the same socioeconomic strata. There are many new immigrant families from countries all over Asia, including Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, that, by definition, have not achieved the “middle-class” demarcation but whose children perform extremely well in academic settings. High-achieving Asian high schoolers from these lower-income households would take many places within the nation’s most prestigious universities which would otherwise be reserved for black people. Socioeconomic affirmative action would, in all likelihood, increase the number of whites and Asians in America’s top universities. Universities would look less diverse if affirmative action was based on income level. Blacks would not be treated equally as a group, and there would be no rectification of past American iniquity (though, again, I believe this last consideration to be less important). Affirmative action is a specifically racial fix for an issue regarding the aiding of downtrodden races. The system is successful when it becomes obsolete — when every race does have equal opportunity.|~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif.

51127|~|The pursuit of frivolity|~|   December 3 2013|~|Column | Dec. 3 |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|After Thanksgiving dinner, I lay on a couch in a family friend’s house, sated and sleepy. Whoever was controlling the remote to the television was graciously interspersing the long stretches of football with periodic spurts of “Modern Family,” to appease those of us who were less touchdown-savvy. A commercial came on, starring the well-coiffed members of One Direction. I assume they were trying to sell the perfume they were holding in bottles, but I can’t be positive because just as they came on the screen, a gaggle of prepubescent girls congregated by the sofas started squealing. That’s when the eyes started rolling. “They’re just a band, girls. Relax.” “You girls get so worked up about something so frivolous.” What struck me as interesting was that not 30 minutes ago, similar noises were coming from the crowd, but no one was making comments. Sure, the yelling was octaves lower, perhaps more guttural. Sure, they were men, and they were yelling about football. But surely the same strain of logic — they’re just a sports team, boys, relax — could apply here just as easily. It happens all the time. In yet another striking episode of Why We Still Need Feminism, it’s been a very common and rarely talked about phenomenon that women’s and girls’ interests are often derided as frivolous, when something of equal significance in a stereotypically male context would be seen as fine. The screaming girls who pack the stadiums of boy band concerts are made fun of. The screaming men that gather around their television sets every for Super Bowl Sunday are given special commercials and deals on pizza and wings. The comparison doesn’t end with just football and One Direction. One of the most female-dominated industries today is fashion — fashion magazines, fashion labels, models, makeup. Coincidentally, it’s also the industry that receives the most flak for being irrelevant to the layperson’s society. People scoff at the idea that skinny jeans can be “in” and pleats can be “out.” People scoff at fashion magazines that list the season’s must-have lipsticks, or splurge-worthy blazers, or designer stilettos. The whole field is viewed more often than not as extraneous — fluffy and inconsequential. If we’re using sports as a stereotypically male-dominated industry, it’s pretty easy to draw the same parallels. What does it really matter who wins the World Series? How is a national obsession with people wrestling over an elliptical ball any less shallow than a features piece on the right blouse length for your body type? Furthermore, attempts at integration are, for the most part, one-sided. Girls are encouraged to try out sports at young ages. Boys are never encouraged to explore their sartorial interests. It’s true that athletics are something that’s easy to translate between the two sexes, but don’t we all wear clothing? It wouldn’t be particularly hard to get boys interested in the color of the shoes that they have to wear everyday, but doing so would be feminizing, and in today’s society, feminizing is the ultimate punishment. On top of this, frivolity isn’t just something used to describe any interest that caters predominantly to women. It’s also something that’s imposed upon women as if it’s the only thing they would be comfortable talking about. Actresses in interviews are consistently asked more “vapid” questions — questions about weight and diet regimens — than are men, who are asked about character and character development, challenging scenes, problems encountered as a serious artist. Earlier in the year, Scarlett Johansson called out an interviewer — who asked her about getting in shape to be the Black Widow in “The Avengers” while her co-star Robert Downey Jr. got a question about the progression of his character’s maturity — for giving her a “rabbit food” question while Downey Jr. got something “really interesting [and] existential.” The herding of women into a category involving frivolity is a societal problem. It’s not something men exclusively impose on women. Women are equally guilty of dismissing female interests as inconsequential. However, equality in causing the problem doesn’t result in an equal bearing of the problem — women are left to deal with it, not men. Acknowledging the fact that this problem exists can only help.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J. She can be reached at shruthid@princeton.edu.

51100|~|A chance for a better affirmative action system|~|   December 3 2013|~|Column | Dec. 3 |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing yet another affirmative action case from Michigan. This time the Court is considering the constitutionality of a 2006 state referendum that bans the use of racial criteria in college admissions. According to CNN, the ban, now part of the Michigan constitution, “prohibits race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions.” As in the past, the general public and the Supreme Court appear to be split ideologically over whether there remains a role for affirmative action in college admission decisions. Some think the elimination of race consideration is the best way to implement the intent behind the 14th Amendment, while others argue that race ought to be an admissions consideration in order to remedy past discrimination. One brief filed in the case even goes so far as to assert that the state ban allows for “de-facto segregation,” working on the assumption that the number of minority students admitted to Michigan’s top universities will shrink under the ban. Valid arguments exist on both sides, and I am no constitutional law expert. Nevertheless, I’d like to propose another criterion for consideration for admissions’ affirmative-action programs: socioeconomic-based affirmative action. An affirmative-action system based on socioeconomic status would likely maintain diversity, the proposed state interest in affirmative action, while avoiding singling out people solely based on race. As proven by the continuous debate and Supreme Court action, race-based affirmative action is messy, yet a socioeconomic system side steps this controversy while providing an equally effective system to achieve the goals affirmative action sets out to do. A socioeconomic-based system would avoid the delicate area race-based considerations create — essentially whether affirmative action is discriminatory toward one group, preferential to another or both, and which, if any, manner of considering criteria is ethical or constitutional. It’s hard to deny that students coming from a lower socioeconomic class are less likely to have access to the resources that are proven to help kids succeed. Social and economic capital, from library books to parents able to help with homework to SAT tutors, all assist students to succeed and gain admittance to top universities. Students with greater financial means, no matter what their race, have greater access to all these resources to better meet college criteria. On the other hand, students who do not have access to the same resources, who might not be able to have an SAT tutor or take the SAT two or three times, might not appear quite as “smart” on paper. Yet in reality, with the same tools, these students might have been just as, if not more, impressive to college admissions staff. This is true no matter the race of the student. Though there might still be past wrongs that ought to be righted, today there is a clearer disadvantage among students due to socioeconomic status than there necessarily is based solely on race. Moreover, given the economic and racial realities of the nation’s current makeup, it is likely that considering socioeconomic status instead of race will still maintain the diverse college community that the state is striving to achieve. According to Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce, at the moment the trend is the opposite; elite schools are becoming more white and more affluent. Unfortunately, statistics show that African-Americans and Latinos are more likely to grow up in areas of poverty than their white peers. Thus, by specially considering socioeconomic status, colleges will de facto include a greater percentage of minority students, creating a racially and economically diverse community. A system like this is currently used at the University of Colorado at Boulder. According to an article in The Atlantic, Matthew Gaertner, a research scientist at the Center for College and Career Success who helped the CU-Boulder admissions office devise its new framework, attempted to create “a class-based affirmative-action framework for CU-Boulder that would take into account resources available to a child at home and in high school.” On one side he considers the disadvantages one’s socioeconomic situation creates, like availability of resources or the likelihood that the applicant will enroll in college at all given his socioeconomic status. He also weighs the “overachievement index,” which measures whether an applicant’s grades and test scores exceed the scores usually achieved by students of his socioeconomic status. In a system like this, the advantages or disadvantages of one’s economic situation is part of the overall consideration of the applicant in order to place everyone, no matter one’s race, on a fairer playing field. Since its first affirmative action decision in 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court just heard the seventh case on the issue this past October, the fourth within the decade. This statistic itself demonstrates how controversial the affirmative action debate is. If the Supreme Court were to uphold Michigan’s law as constitutional, this would allow any state to ban race-based affirmative action. Yet, even so, socioeconomic affirmative action is an effective solution to such a ban on a race-based system. Implementation of a socioeconomic, class-based system will fairly and constitutionally help universities become even more diverse than they currently are.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C.

50894|~|Lemon lime|~|   December 2 2013|~|Column | Dec. 2 |~|Daniel Xu|~|None|~|Until recently, I thought that limes were just unripe lemons. I had always been perplexed about why limes are sweeter than lemons, but then again, I am rather easily perplexed by a great many things. There are a lot of clever sayings about what to do when life gives you lemons but not a whole lot of folksy wisdom about where those lemons came from in the first place. Certain epistemologists could make the argument that without actually sitting yourself down in front of a lime when you’ve got a lot of time to kill, you can’t really be certain that it won’t eventually turn into a lemon. After all, plenty of things start out green and then wind up yellow — bananas, for instance. Green bananas, the kind that the dining hall never seems to run out of, are nasty-tasting and tough to eat, but they become yellow and soft and delicious after you sneak a few out in your coat pocket and leave them lying around in your room for a while. Leaves, too, start green and finish yellow. The leaves of the gingko tree between the University Chapel and East Pyne are green in the spring but explode in a brilliant overnight shower of gold in the fall. If those leaves belonged not to a gingko but to a lime or lemon tree, my friends might never have discovered my gap in knowledge, and I might have been saved a good bit of ridicule. But they did discover it, and for a while it was as though I had revealed that I still believed in Santa Claus or kept a jar of loose teeth set aside to cash in on a rainy day. “How could you have not known that? Didn’t anyone ever tell you? Is that even something that has to be told to you?” How could this crucial piece of knowledge have managed to slip past me? When are you supposed to learn that, although juvenile lemons are indeed green and bumpy and look quite a bit like limes, the two are not actually the same thing? After the study of algebra? Before? I thought back to my boyhood in search of an explanation. I realized that my mother had never really used lemons or limes in her cooking, eschewing them for ingredients like soy sauce and sorghum vinegar. So I texted my brother — “Did you know limes and lemons are different fruit?” — thinking that someone who shared a common dietary history with me would surely share a common level of dietary ignorance. “Uh / Yes / How did you not,” came his response. Maybe he’d learned it in poetry class. Desperate to identify a kindred soul, I began to slip this topic into conversation with friends. I succeeded only in further confirming my suspicions that I am the only person in the world who missed the memo explaining that limes are not to lemons as piglets are to pigs. It is very much in the spirit of Princeton to be competitive — about grades, about social standing, about career prospects. A few of my friends recently made me aware of a course offered here in which a significant portion of students’ grades is determined by their ability to sell more virtual orange juice than their classmates can. My private embarrassment concerning citrus fruits aside, I find it oddly comforting to know that, although we find ourselves in an environment in which we often have the opportunity to compare ourselves harshly to our peers, most everyone seems to understand that limes are not just unfulfilled lemons. “Everybody is a genius,” Einstein once said, apparently with a straight face. “But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Likewise, if you judge a lime by its ability to squeeze out a glass of lemonade — or a glass of orange juice, for that matter — you will find yourself sorely disappointed in that lime. But limes can take you many places that lemons cannot: Only by starting out with a lime can you wind up with limeade, or key lime pie, or that beach-ready Bud Light variant that Anheuser-Busch hawks in the summertime. Every fruit has something unique to bring to the dining room table. Every person, too.|~|Daniel Xu is a molecular biology major from Knoxville, Tenn. He can be reached at dcxu@princeton.edu.

50902|~|The USG needs your vote|~|   December 2 2013|~|Column | Dec. 2 |~|Spencer Shen|~|None|~|Last week, the 2013 USG elections were held over a three-day period, with the results announced over Thanksgiving break. Although many newly elected and reelected USG officers walked away with well-earned victories, the lackluster voter turnout is a disappointing sign of Princeton students’ apathy toward the USG. Based on the reported vote counts, just over 1,900 students — much fewer than half of the total undergraduate student body, which numbers over 5,000 — voted in this year’s elections. In last year’s USG presidential election, just under 2,300 students voted, including fewer than 500 seniors — a slightly better figure, but still a pitifully low percentage of the overall undergraduate population. This isn’t just a result of increased apathy among upperclassmen; in this year’s freshman class council elections, only 677 freshmen out of a class of 1,291 students voted. Any American citizen is used to the phenomenon of low voter turnout — even in our presidential elections, the turnout is rarely over 60 percent — but we Princeton students are supposed to be more politically informed than the average person, more aware of the need to participate in the political processes that directly affect us. The USG is supposed to be a central part of campus activities and a unified voice that can effectively communicate with the administration for undergraduate students. The officers do an admirable job of attempting to maintain transparency and stay in touch with their constituency — everything from informal “office hours” to open meetings — but attendance at these initiatives is relatively low and the USG still faces a negative image of ineffectiveness on campus, as newly reelected president Shawon Jackson ’15 acknowledged during the candidates’ debate two weeks ago. Some skeptics view any kind of politics with a jaded eye and like to bring up personal benefits — financial or otherwise — as politicians’ main motivation to run for office, but USG officers don’t really receive any tangible benefits in return for their time and effort besides a line or two on their resumes. Serving as a USG officer is a volunteer job, yet the candidates still take campaigning seriously, going door-to-door and spending countless hours promoting themselves and their platforms before the elections. Many abstaining voters do not like or prefer any of the available candidates, and so they choose not to vote at all. This can be an understandable choice for an individual, but when the majority of a population chooses not to vote, we cannot really know what the outcome of an election should be. Although Jackson won by a large majority, and we can assume he would have won had every student cast a vote, we don’t know this for sure. It is possible that 60 percent of the student body does not like either Jackson or Zach Ogle ’15, but the more likely conclusion is that these students simply do not care and are uninformed about the USG elections — a sad truth when the USG is our main channel for actually turning complaints into changes. Some students might choose not to vote because they believe the USG does not have the influence to make any real changes happen on campus. However, we cannot ever expect it to be influential if we continue to hold this kind of self-perpetuating sentiment — complaining about unsatisfactory facets of undergraduate life while viewing the USG as ineffective definitely won’t result in any of the changes we want. There really is no reason not to vote in the USG elections. The ballots are cast online and take only a few minutes to complete, with repeated email notifications sent out to remind students to vote. The candidates’ statements are all available online as well, and the candidates themselves are very accessible through the various channels set up by the USG. On top of that, most of the candidates do a hefty amount of door-to-door campaigning, along with other tasks such as putting up posters and handing out flyers. Moreover, this issue is not limited to Princeton — despite our reputation as a politically uninvolved campus, we are not the only school that tends to overlook its own campus politics. Harvard’s undergraduate student government elections were held a few weeks before ours, and the “joke ticket” won by a small but sizeable margin of 200 students out of about 3,200 total voters — also fewer than half of the total undergraduate student body — but the newly elected president and vice president immediately resigned from their positions, and a new election will be held to determine the new ones soon. Perhaps this time, the student body will realize that a small group of motivated pranksters can actually swing an election the wrong way — imagine if Stephen Colbert had actually been elected president last year. Harvard will surely learn from this fiasco, and Princeton and other schools should take note. Hopefully, we will never elect any joke candidates, but maybe that’s the kind of shock we need in order to start caring about our USG.|~|Spencer Shen is a sophomore from Houston, Texas.

50885|~|Rethinking the puzzle of well-being|~|   December 2 2013|~|Column | Dec. 2 |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|The day classes end for Thanksgiving break is a cold and rainy one, a perfect day for being alone with your thoughts. My three roommates have already left for home, and, all alone, I mull over in my mind something I’ve been putting off. After going back and forth about it, I finally decide: It’s time. I put on my boots and coat, grab an umbrella and head for my destination. When I arrive, it appears to be all smoke and mirrors. It’s after hours, so I have to ring a doorbell. “Are you safe?” Just the question in and of itself makes me question my decision to go. I answer, “Yes,” and am given directions to go up a flight of stairs. I arrive in a white hall, decorated with pretty yet bland paintings of nature — like any proper office — and a nurse asks me to take a seat, as she is checking somebody else’s vitals. As I sit, I twiddle my thumbs, text my friend who is waiting for her flight at Newark Airport and vaguely wonder, “What am I doing here?” I am in McCosh Health Center. Before this visit, I had only been to McCosh twice. The first time was last October, when I felt like crap after my midterms; I was sent away with an order of Tylenol and a lot of fluids. The second was also last October, when I had to get a shot and receive a prescription before my freshman seminar trip to Costa Rica. In both instances, I felt no sort of strange tingles or nervousness in going to McCosh, similar to what I think someone would feel for going to the center due to one too many drinks on a night out (though I cannot know this for sure). We — as in students, the University and society as a whole — know that our physical health is something that should always be looked after; carelessness in this sphere of well-being affects everything else we do in life. Though we may be embarrassed to show others that we have indeed been careless, people would, in general, much rather suffer this than allow any illness to spiral out of control entirely. Mental health is a completely different arena. For one, it is not emphasized nearly as much as physical health. Of course, University Health Services and the Peer Health Advisors put on their mental health screening event this year, and the meningitis scare has made putting physical health on the forefront a necessity. Still, even before all this hoopla, it always seemed like physical health came first. Moreover, one could also see mental health as the same smoke and mirrors as the entrance to McCosh. A change in mental health is not always as obvious as physical health; you can’t put your hand to someone’s forehead and say, “Hmm, I think there’s a chemical imbalance in your brain.” It simply doesn’t work like that. Outward validation is more difficult to receive, and, as a result, people seek it less or treat it less importantly. And needless to say, mental health is forever being romanticized, and it is consequently treated less like an important aspect of someone’s general well-being and more like a personal self-indulgence. Was I being self-indulgent when I finally decided I needed to talk to someone? My essential problem was going from a place of assuredness in my major, my post-grad plans and my professional hopes to what, in my mind, seemed like square one. I was spending so much time pondering and worrying about the future that I began missing out on my present. I didn’t think this was a particularly unique problem for an undergraduate before her sophomore spring, but my random moments of purposelessness were enough to worry me. In the end, I do not regret my decision one bit. The friendly nurse, whose warm blond hair and smile offset the slight coldness of the white walls, instantly put me at ease. As it was after hours, I was put on the phone with a UHS counselor. I expected our talk to be no longer than 15 minutes. I underestimated by about 45 minutes. I felt the unexpected relief of talking to someone about how I felt, not in relation to classes or grades, but in the strict sense of my general happiness and health. I can’t say I have a sure sense of what my future holds, but I can honestly say I am much more comfortable with it now. Many people think that to seek help, one must be in the worst mental state possible, whereas the tiniest of coughs justifies worry. Maybe this has something to do with the stigma that comes with actively caring for your mental health or fearing that others will view your concern as overreacting. But, simply put, I would much rather over-react in the present than leave my inner peace and mental health on the back burner until it’s almost snuffed out.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La.

50673|~|Outside the Bubble: Legalize it|~|   December 1 2013|~|Column | Dec. 1 |~|David Will|~|None|~|Colorado and Washington state legalized marijuana for recreational use just over one year ago. Opponents warned that voters had created the new Sodom and Gomorrah. Yet both states are miraculously still standing and are implementing regulatory regimes to tax the drug and govern its distribution and use. To many residents, legalizing the recreational use of marijuana in states that allow its medicinal use must not have seemed remarkable. Reported cases of migraines, anxiety and sleep apnea among 20-somethings may plummet. But other than that, as time passes, it’s hard to fathom what had opponents of legalization in such a tizzy. The medical case for continuing prohibition is more nebulous than smoke from a joint. Marijuana is less harmful to people’s health than tobacco. A 2012 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association compared the long-term affects of weed and cigarettes. Habitual tobacco smokers, the study found, suffered greater lung damage than marijuana users over 20 years. In fact, the study actually downplayed the dangers of taking an infrequent toke. “Our findings suggest that occasional use of marijuana … may not be associated with adverse consequences on pulmonary function,” Dr. Mark Pletcher, the paper’s main author, said. The discrepancy between the two substances’ health effects has to do in part with the different ways in which they are used. Smokers take many fewer puffs of joints than drags of cigarettes. Opponents of legalization correctly note that if weed were smoked as frequently as tobacco, it would cause significant pulmonary damage. But there is nothing compelling or unique about this argument for continuing marijuana’s prohibition. Legalization may lure more people into trying weed, but there is no evidence to suggest that it will cause those individuals to abuse the drug grossly and habitually. In addition to medical arguments, proponents of prohibition frequently rely on a favorite scare tactic: the “gateway drug” fallacy. In 1999, Congress called on the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to draft a report on whether marijuana leads to the use of hard drugs. The Institute found, “There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.” With health concerns allayed, states should legalize, tax and regulate weed to generate revenue and ensure its safe use by those who are of age. Legalizing marijuana would be an important step toward ending the ballooning incarceration rates in America brought on, in part, by the drug war. The pernicious, racially disparate impacts of America’s drug laws extend well beyond statutes pertaining to weed. But marijuana laws are indicative of the broader inequities ingrained in the criminal justice system. Blacks and whites use weed at roughly the same rates. Yet blacks are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. These arrests, charges and convictions hamper applicants’ job prospects by forming a ceiling above which it is difficult to rise. There are also strong financial incentives to legalize marijuana. Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron estimates that ending weed’s prohibition would save the country $7.7 billion in enforcement annually. There are broader social costs to keeping marijuana illegal, in addition to direct government spending on enforcement. Tax revenue garnered from selling marijuana would also help alleviate states’ budgetary constraints. For example, Washington state projects that weed sales will yield up to $1.9 billion over five years. That money could go toward reducing a deficit, revitalizing a school system, rebuilding a road or any other shortage facing a state. But legalization’s benefits aren’t only domestic. The billions in potential revenue come with an added national security benefit. The Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a highly respected Mexican think tank, estimated that legalizing marijuana would cost the Mexican cartels 30 percent of their earnings from trafficking. Legalization wouldn’t bring down the cartels overnight, as they generate profits from a slew of horrid ventures; when faced with diminished revenue, the cartels spawn new cash streams like the Hydra sprouts heads. Ending weed’s prohibition is only one important component of a broader strategy beat the cartels. With no medical or fiscal case left to make, prohibition advocates peddle conflicting stereotypes about pot. It’s hard to argue that legalizing marijuana will both subdue a generation into scarfing Cheetos on the couch and be a ruinous social ill. Well, Americans are seeing through the charade in record numbers. For the first time, a majority of Americans — 58 percent, to be exact — favor legalizing the drug. The unprecedented support for ending prohibition evidences millenials’ undeniable independent streak. Whether it’s marijuana or gay marriage, young people today are asking their parents one simple question in increasing numbers: What’s the big deal?|~|David Will is a religion major from Chevy Chase, Md.

50685|~|Editorial: Transparency in bonfire decision-making|~|   December 1 2013|~|Editorial | Dec. 1 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|During the preparations for the recent bonfire, there was significant debate in the student body concerning the decision not to burn the effigies that had been included in the bonfire the previous year. The rationale given for the decision was that the burning of effigies offended certain members of the community because of the ugly racial and ethnic histories associated with effigy burning. The Board does not want to take a side in this debate because the full extent of the objections that were made and the full rationale for the decision not to burn the effigies are not known. However, the Board feels that the lack of information given about the decision and the failure to consult the student body in a timely and systematic fashion on the decision represents a failure on the part of USG, ODUS and the class councils that were involved in making the decision. The Board does not mean to criticize the students that objected to the effigies — these objections might have been deeply personal, and the students who made them may have been unwilling to make them in a public forum. However, this should not have prevented USG or the class councils from soliciting other input. As bodies that exist to represent the opinion of the entire student body, USG and the class councils have a responsibility to make an effort to include all opinions in the process. There was ample time to arrange campus focus groups or to conduct an informal poll of the student body on the issue after last year’s bonfire. It is troubling that a USG that constantly promises accessibility and transparency upheld neither of these values during its recent decision-making process. The lack of transparency about the decision process is also troubling. While the petition that was circulated in response to the decision to remove the effigies was ultimately based on incorrect information, the responsibility for providing this information ultimately belongs to the elected representatives of the student body. Though the student body has delegated some of its decision-making power to them, it does not mean that they are no longer obligated to inform students of the rationale for their choices in a timely and effective fashion. Fundamentally, the Board thinks it is disappointing that only those voices that spoke the loudest were represented in a decision that affected the entire student body. Those who dissent are often loudest and most visible in debates over campus practice, but this does not mean that those who approve of the status quo do not exist; nor does it mean that their quiet assent is not important. The Board believes the burning of effigies is not such an offensive act that it precludes campus debate on the issue. It is the job of our governing bodies to consider all perspectives, but that cannot happen when no effort is made to reach out to all students. All of the organizations involved in this decision failed to provide the transparency and accessibility they promised to the student body. This is especially true of those bodies that were elected by the student body and appear to have responded to only the wishes of a vocal minority. The Board recognizes that this event is especially important for the varsity football team and that, consequently, organizers of the event were right to attempt to proactively include representatives of the Athletic Department and football team in the planning process. But this does not preclude our elected representatives from carefully considering the views of the entire student body. As the campus prepares to welcome a new USG administration, we hope that when it comes to future decisions that affect the whole student body, more of an effort will be made to reach out to all students. Dylan Ackerman is recused due to his position as vice president of 2014 Class Council. DISSENT The majority can’t understand the “full rationale for the decision not to burn the effigies,” and it faults our elected representatives’ failure to follow a political process. We understand the USG rationale. But bonfires should build a sense of community, not threaten it. The symbolism of the act of burning — not what was being burned — was at issue. Think of lynching, guillotining or crucifixion. Such reenactments could be painful to descendants of the recipients of these historical punishments. College communities should discourage behavior perceived as offensive to specific groups. As John F. Kennedy illustrated in “Profiles in Courage,” sometimes we entrust elected officials to do the right thing.

50665|~|23andMe vs the FDA|~|   December 1 2013|~|Column | Dec. 1 |~|Katherine Zhao|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|For $99, a customer can spit into a tube and receive a detailed report on their ancestry and inherited risk factors for diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. 23andMe is a firm that provides such personal genetic testing. There are many benefits of ordering a test, such as knowing which medical conditions one is more likely to develop and being able to take preventative measures against the diseases that one has an increased likelihood of developing. The test can also reveal any adverse reactions one may have to certain drugs, help plan for a family by revealing carrier status for genetically inherited diseases and help one understand health risks. DNA tells us a lot about our health. This is the first time customers are able to have their DNA sequenced and receive a personal report. This is a major advancement in healthcare, as doctors can now help customers take personalized preventative measures and extend lifespans. However, on Nov. 22, the Food and Drug Administration threw a wrench into the genetic information revolution underway in the U.S. Alberto Gutierrez, the head of the FDA’s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, wrote a stern letter to 23andme, a genetic testing company, ordering it to stop marketing its service on the grounds that the service constitutes “medical advice,” which should only be released to the customer through a doctor. The FDA has concerns that people may misinterpret their results and overreact to prevent a condition for which the risk is actually negligible, potentially decreasing their health by taking inordinately extreme measures. For example, a woman with an increased risk for breast cancer may push her doctor to order a mastectomy that she may not necessarily need. The FDA holds that since people may make life-changing medical decisions based on the test results, the firm needs to verify that its data is accurate. The FDA’s letter aimed at halting 23andMe advertising is not completely unwarranted, though. There are some requests from the FDA that the company did not follow up on, which prompted the letter. After the firm applied for FDA approval in 2012, the agency requested information on ensuring the accuracy of test results, which the company provided little of. In fact, there has been no communication between the two since May of this year. The company should pick up the ball and provide the information the FDA requested instead of ignoring the letter and continuing to market their $99 personal testing service. Though the company has until Dec. 13 to respond, all attempts should be made to resolve the dispute with the FDA. 23andMe is the largest of the genome test providers and is therefore a crucial player in the personal genetic-testing phenomenon that has the ability to revolutionize the medical field. The genetic data collected from the 400,000 customers so far create a rich source of medical information for important research. As more people’s genetic information is added to the database, research and advancement in medical biotechnology can progress even further. But the FDA’s disapproval could halt this groundbreaking revolution in personal genomics. While there is merit to the FDA’s claim that unnecessary medical procedures could be made from test results, founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki maintains that people have the right to know their own medical information. Preventing people from being able to access their genetic information takes away their ability to take potentially life-saving measures to protect themselves against the diseases they are at increased risk for. If the agency is required to verify genetic markers as precursors for disease, this may mean the end of direct company-to-customer flow of genetic information. While there is no way for the company to be able to ensure 100 percent accuracy for results, perhaps a rule could be put into place to let people access their results through a doctor to help them interpret the results and make informed medical decisions. Such a solution seems to be to the benefit of everyone involved. College students like us should be aware of the options modern biotechnology has provided for us to care for our health. Personal genomic testing is very likely to become a staple in healthcare in the future, in which everyone gets their DNA analyzed to know the conditions they are prone to so they can make better lifestyle decisions. It is the government’s role to regulate new technology and promote the welfare of the people, but this is a revolution for medicine, biotechnology and personal genomics, and it is not worth halting a revolution because of a simple lack of communication between the company and the FDA. There is a great deal of information in our DNA, and there is the technology to know it. All that stands between us and enlightenment is a petty dispute between health-service providers and health-service regulators. They should take whatever measures necessary to end this spat if they are both truly committed to the common goal of promoting optimal health in the U.S.|~|Katherine Zhao is a freshman from East Brunswick, N.J.

50435|~|Looking past the outbreak|~|   November 26 2013|~|Column | Nov. 26 |~|Spencer Shen|~|None|~|In light of the recent meningitis cases on campus and the ensuing news coverage that has catapulted us into the national media spotlight, we should take a step back and consider the general state of public health among the undergraduate student body here at Princeton. Seventy-six percent of the interviewed respondents in The Daily Princetonian’s poll last week said they would accept the meningitis B vaccine not yet licensed by the FDA. Based on previous years’ numbers for FluFest, the annual flu vaccination clinics offered through University Health Services, an increasing majority of Princeton students and faculty elect to receive the flu vaccine each year. However, if we look past these highly visible and well-publicized threats to the student body’s health, there are many more issues that are largely ignored amid the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding the meningitis outbreak. UHS has a widespread presence on campus. In every bathroom, the sinks are accompanied by laminated posters reminding us all to wash our hands for at least 20 seconds, to make sure we use soap and to turn off the faucet with a paper towel instead of touching the dirty faucet handles. However, these directions go largely unheeded by the hundreds of students who pass through the bathrooms in Frist Campus Center, Dillon Gymnasium and other high-traffic buildings. I doubt that anyone has conducted a controlled study on the percentage of bathroom visits that actually conform to the UHS recommendations, but personally, I have never seen anyone use a paper towel to turn off a sink faucet. Near every computer cluster is a poster reminding students to follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away from the screen for 20 seconds at something 20 feet away — but how many of us notice these signs, let alone follow their advice? The recent UHS campaign to “Keep Healthy and Carry On” and the Student Health Advisory Board program that came up with the “Mine. Not Yours.” cups have achieved relatively high visibility on campus but only because of the hubbub surrounding the meningitis outbreak. Long-term projects, such as UHS’s online collection of information and advice on “hot topics” in student health, are often unnoticed or ignored. It took a catchy slogan like “Keep Healthy and Carry On” printed on colorful posters to remind students not to share drinks or utensils, and still these warnings seem to end up being taken like worried advice from overprotective parents — something to be satirized instead of taken seriously. In reality, there already exist several issues with the overall health, both physical and mental, of the student body, most of which are far more of a threat in the long term than meningitis or the flu. Although contagious diseases like meningitis and the flu are certainly urgent concerns and should not be shrugged off easily, some of the biggest dangers to students’ health come from damage that we do to ourselves. Even if we ignore controversial topics like alcohol use or recreational drug use, there are many incredibly unhealthy behaviors that many students engage in regularly, the effects of which may not truly be felt until years after graduation. For non-athletes, exercise is one of the first healthy behaviors to be sacrificed when work starts piling up. Despite the proven benefits of even just getting up and stretching or taking a quick walk, students force themselves to stay put in un-ergonomic chairs and to slave away. In the case of “sleep hygiene,” there seems to be a relatively clear division on campus between those who sleep regular hours every day and in appropriate amounts, and those who sleep at irregular times and generally do not obtain adequate sleep. Almost all Princeton students have experienced the effects of sleep deprivation at some point, yet most of us still go to sleep too late, wake up too early and partake in copious amounts of caffeine to keep ourselves going throughout the day. Hunching over our desks to read textbooks printed in miniscule fonts, keeping our eyes glued to a computer screen for work and then for entertainment and snacking on unhealthy processed foods as we study — these are all behaviors that put unnecessary stress on our bodies. The old joke of “sleep, social life, grades — pick two” aptly sums up the dilemma that Princeton students face on a regular basis — replace “sleep” with “exercise,” and the same principle still holds. The psychological effects of self-induced stress are not to be underestimated either — the effects of sleep deprivation, lack of exercise or unhealthy eating are all exacerbated when mental health is thrown into the mix, whether that entails stress over workload and grades or an eating disorder or issues with self-image. Shifting and distorting our sleep schedules, eating unhealthy junk at random times and slouching over a computer screen might work for four years of college, for a few more years of medical school, for the first few years at a finance job, but eventually our bad habits will catch up to us. If we truly want to “Keep Healthy and Carry On” in our post-Princeton lives, it will take more than just red cups and colorful posters.|~|Spencer Shen is a sophomore from Austin, Texas.

50420|~|Beyond TFA|~|   November 25 2013|~|Column | Nov. 25 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|by Claire Nuchtern Whenever i tell people I want to be a teacher, I typically get the same response. Whether I am talking to a friend at school, a friend from home or a family friend, they typically ask, “So, you’re looking at TFA?” I normally surprise them when I let them know that no, I have no desire to become a TFA corps member. After having all of these myriad conversations about the omnipresent TFA, I’ve realized that it is not my only, or even my best, option as an aspiring teacher. Teach for America originated from a senior thesis project at Princeton. Wendy Kopp ’89, a Wilson School major, was frustrated with the consistent flow of Princeton students to consulting and Wall Street firms and wanted to provide an equally prestigious opportunity in public service. Her program recruits high-achieving college students to spend at least two years teaching low-income students. The teacher-recruits receive five weeks of training, with the assumption that afterward they will be good to go. Over the past 23 years, Wendy’s organization has placed 33,000 of these high-achieving college graduates in front of some of our country’s most disadvantaged students. Many consider TFA to be a valuable program, with good reason. First, in most studies, TFA teachers have been shown to be no worse than an average incoming teacher at English and slightly better in math, based on their students’ standardized test scores. Second, despite the fact that only 28 percent are still teaching five years out (compared to 50 percent of all teachers), TFA argues that their corps members will always retain the social justice perspective that they gained from their two-year commitment. Finally, TFA does have the distinct advantage of being able to provide a full teacher’s salary in its first year, unlike the smaller stipends of other teacher-training options. My problem with TFA is not that it’s necessarily harmful to all students or all school districts, but rather that it’s not the only option for high-achieving college students who want to be teachers. It is impressive that TFA teachers, despite only having five weeks of training, are able to perform at the average level that they do. But, what if we gave them a year of hands-on training? How effective could they be then? Here, I am specifically referencing the Teaching Residency model. Based off the medical residency, participants in a teaching residency program spend a year training to be an urban teacher through two major pathways. The first, and the most crucial, is spending a year in a classroom with a veteran urban teacher, gradually taking on more and more responsibility as the year goes on. The first month of the year might be spent observing and getting to know the students. By November, residents teach a full week of courses and by May, they instruct half of the classes. All of the training occurs within the school district where the residents will spend the next three years teaching — diverging from TFA’s model of training in a summer school in a city where the corps member may never teach again. Simultaneously, residents receive a free masters in education, taught by the same people who are their instructional coaches in the classroom. This allows professors to tailor their content to meet each teacher’s specific needs. There are now 17 residency models across the country in cities including Boston, New York, D.C. and Los Angeles. I was first introduced to the Boston model during my summer of teaching middle school math through a fantastic program called Breakthrough Collaborative. Breakthrough has a two-fold mission of launching low-income middle school students on the path to college and encouraging high-achieving college students to consider urban education as a career path. Toward the end of the summer, we had a career panel at which different teacher preparation programs came to talk with us. I was immediately blown away by Boston Teacher Residency. Residency programs see teaching as a skilled profession that requires intensive and hands-on training. Each residency program is developed in conjunction with the school district, ensuring that the program produces graduates that will be invaluable to the school district. And finally, it produces some of the most dedicated teachers in this country. After 10 years, 87 percent of BTR teachers are still teaching. These are teachers who were trained well and therefore have the energy to keep on doing what they love. TFA, with its “sink or swim” model, often burns out its corps members, essentially ensuring that many aspiring teachers wind up leaving teaching to pursue work outside of the classroom. Contrastingly, BTR staff continue to provide support and advising to former residents, allowing them to fix any weak areas as quickly as possible to maximize student learning. One day I hope to step into my own classroom as Ms. Nuchtern, a middle school math teacher. My first year of teaching will be difficult no matter the circumstances. This simple fact motivates me to get the best preparation possible to ensure that I can help my students achieve at the level they deserve.|~|Claire Nuchtern is a Wilson School major from Houston, Texas.

50169|~|Speaking out on speaking up|~|   November 25 2013|~|Columns Opinion |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|In her column last Thursday, Tehila Wenger argued that the reasons behind “women’s relative silence” in class are nuanced and complex. Faculty, among others, shouldn’t assume when a girl in class doesn’t speak up that it’s due to decades of women being brainwashed into timidity. I agree that it would be a mistake for faculty to unhesitatingly assume these gender stereotypes are true. However, no matter how legitimate these women’s rationales for silence are, as Wenger acknowledged, they do “speak” to how genders tend to approach class participation differently. Rightly or wrongly, class participation is important. In certain classes, it is a significant component in determining success in the course. Thus, these gender differences in behavior can create a greater problem than Wenger recognizes. As Wenger noted, it seems that women tend to speak up more when they believe they have “something worthwhile to say” and not merely for the sake of participation itself. This sounds reasonable. But are women being too self-critical about the worthiness of their thoughts? Is this silence stifling the free flow of ideas? Preventing a synergy of inspiration? Of course, it is a generalization that women speak less in class. There are plenty of women who defy this assumption. But whether or not the women who fall into this category are the majority, it seems to be a legitimate problem, at least in certain situations. It is thus worthy of thoughtful discussion, so long as it is clear that these gender generalizations do not necessarily apply across the board, as that would be a gross misrepresentation of the problem. The problem exists in coed environments from classrooms to the business conference table, when men dominate the discussion. Whether or not they have something new to add to the conversation, in general men seem more willing to participate. Once again, this varies from person to person but seems to occur often enough to create a real dichotomy between male and female participation; women speak less, therefore, it looks as though women are too timid to speak, even if that isn’t true. If we acknowledge that women feeling that they have nothing to say is a legitimate reason not to speak up, but men indeed do speak up even when they are not adding much value to the conversation, then we either have to accept the fact that men are just going to speak up more because they feel that their comments are worthwhile, or we have to educate them to be more cautious about participation and only join in the discussion when they have something valuable to add. Wenger suggested that she disagreed that women should be encouraged to raise their hands for the mere sake of creating parity with men. As she said, “We should be discouraging men from these behaviors, not pushing women toward them.” I, for one, agree that men don’t inherently have more to say than women. That would be just as absurd as claiming that one gender is smarter than the other. That being said, I do question which general style of participation is better. In reality, a mixture of different thinking and participation styles is probably best. I’d rather be at a discussion table where people are throwing out ideas than one where participants are weighing the value of every thought before sharing it. Better that than stifling conversation with self-censorship. Even if an idea might not initially seem to have much apparent worth, more will stem from discussing the concept than not offering it in the first place. Women shouldn’t be overcritical about the value of their comments; they should just throw them on the table as men often do. It is difficult to deny that we still live in a male-dominated world, with respect to both education and business. For example, according to a 2010 University report on diversity, less than one quarter of its associate and full professors in 2010 were women, up from just 3 percent three decades ago. And in 2013, only 22 Fortune 500 CEOs were women. Given this reality, Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and author of “Lean In,” argues that women must make more of an effort to speak up and go for things, even if they are unsure of whether they are right, capable or have something worthwhile to say. Unfortunately, at the moment, women must adhere to this generally male habit of speaking up in order to have the same level of success. Speaking out merely for the sake of speaking is not ideal; it would be best if everyone always had worthwhile things to add. However, since we live in a non-ideal system that rewards male behavior and is currently too firmly in place to change, women speaking out even when they are unsure whether or not what they have to add is worthwhile is a necessary evil. The fact that such unfiltered banter is valued in our current male-dominated society is yet another reason that women should speak up more. Understanding how this trend plays out leads me to believe that there is more women can and should do regarding speaking out. And we can begin with the classroom discussions we experience weekly.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu.

50161|~|Editorial: Jackson for President |~|   November 24 2013|~|Editorial | Nov. 24 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Following last week’s ex post facto decision allowing Zach Ogle ’15 to run against incumbent Shawon Jackson ’15 for the office of USG president, the Editorial Board conducted interviews to determine our endorsement position in this upcoming election. After sitting down with both candidates, the Board believes that Shawon Jackson ’15 is the better choice for USG president. Both candidates whom we interviewed showed considerable promise, and this board is ultimately convinced that both are qualified for the position. Jackson, however, is set apart by his broad experience, comprehensive platform and his already-existing relationships with key University decision-makers. In the past year of Jackson’s tenure, he has operated on a platform seeking in part to broaden the USG’s accessibility. This campaign promise has resulted in the introduction of regular “office hours,” a dedicated period for students to bring forth issues or suggestions to Jackson and USG vice president Carmina Mancenon ’14. Jackson has also substantively contributed to reforms within the USG, for instance, introducing “advisory groups,” a series of small teams charged with providing in-house feedback on USG projects. These reforms were complemented by enhanced individual contact between Jackson and other members of the USG, intended to continually assess internal effectiveness and promote a spirit of camaraderie. The Board recognizes that these advisory groups may have had less success than Jackson hoped. We hope that this program will be refined in the coming year so as to increase its efficacy. While Jackson admits that there was room for improvement in the past year of the USG’s operation, the Board believes that his experience will prove invaluable in a second term. His current platform centers on “moving forward,” a theme that encapsulates the importance of learning from past errors and successes and using that experience to improve future USG governance. This theme is a good indicator of what Jackson brings to the table with a year in office behind him. Indeed, Jackson’s reflections on past performance point to a willingness to look critically back upon his first term. The Board encourages this openness to criticism and commends Jackson’s dedication to continual improvement and introspection. In our discussion, Jackson emphasized three primary policy areas: reforms to the academic advising system, enrichment of interclass relations through a University-wide mentorship program and enhanced collaboration with student leaders at peer institutions. He has shown a strong existing commitment to this last proposition in particular, presently co-chairing this year’s Ivy Policy Conference Planning Team. We feel that these areas are important to the University community and deserving of USG attention. Jackson aims to further broaden efforts in reaching out to the student body, intending to introduce a new bimonthly newsletter communicating the USG’s activities throughout the year. He also maintains strong existing ties to University leadership, having developed these relationships over the course of his present term. The Board sees this quality as integral to a successful and productive second stay in office. In all, the Board is convinced that Jackson possesses ideas of greater substance and is equipped with superior means to accomplishing his mandate than his opponent. We feel that his year of experience and existing relationships will enable to be a more effective president than Ogle. We further believe that his platform is more comprehensive, detailed and concrete, which will facilitate effective action during the early days of the coming term. On the basis of these qualifications, we endorse him for USG president. Irrespective of outcome, however, the Board encourages the eventual victor to focus on small-scale and practically feasible projects in their upcoming term, using his office to develop and promote policy changes that will tangibly and materially impact the student experience. Ultimately, this election represents an ideal forum for meaningful discourse on the office of USG president and on the role of the USG in general. We strongly encourage students to use this election as a means of expressing their views and participating in campus dialogue concerning important issues.|~|Zach Horton ’15, Jillian Wilkowski ’15, Brandon Holt ’15, Cara Eckholm ’14, Daphna LeGall ’15, Sean Chen ’14, Dylan Ackerman ’14, Eve Levin ’14, Connor Mui ’14 and Varun Sharma ’15 recused, either due to conflicts of interest or because they could not attend interviews. 
50149|~|'No collaboration' policies|~|   November 24 2013|~|Columns Opinion |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|In theory, the purpose of problems sets should be to reinforce students’ skills outside of class by application of what was taught in lecture. Problem sets in college do perhaps require more critical thinking than the rote homework problems given in high school, but the main purpose is still practice. Assessments, on the other hand, gauge a student’s progress, concretely measuring what they know and how accurately they apply it. Some classes confuse the distinction between these two concepts by implementing a strict “no collaboration” homework policy that prevents students from discussing problem sets together or checking over the answers. This confusion severely limits students from practicing their skills outside of class with accuracy because they may complete entire problem sets with the wrong knowledge, thus practicing mistaken methods until they become bad habits. In my Princeton experience so far, I’ve had five classes with “no collaboration” homework policies. In some instances, for example in computer science classes, I believe no collaboration is justified. Assignments, which are the closest equivalent to problem sets in other classes, are distinguished by the fact that students can check if they were right in an assignment — either the program works or it doesn’t work. Students are much less likely to implement a wrong algorithm throughout the entire program and still come up with the right answer. Some classes and assignments even have a partner programming provision — students may work with one other person and bounce ideas off of one another, correcting each others’ mistakes. Because COS assignments can be self-checked, it is highly unlikely that students will learn and practice erroneous knowledge. On the other hand, in two economics classes I’ve taken so far, the “no collaboration” policy only caused confusion. To have “no collaboration” policies for paper-and-pencil problem sets meant that I had no idea if I had done all the problems incorrectly. For those classes, students wouldn’t even know if they were approaching problems the right way until the solutions came back. In particular, if the solutions were unclear or inadequately explained, then students were completely on their own about how the problem was solved. This ambiguity regarding concepts taught in class would extend all the way to exams. Only then would we realize if we were learning things correctly — by the check marks or X’s on a midterm that was worth 30 percent of our entire course grade. In another econ class I took without a “no collaboration” policy, that was never the case. I was never unclear about the material we learned in class because I was able to check my methods with other students through problem sets. It wasn’t as if we simply copied off one another either — we argued over every problem, drawing conflicting diagrams and trying to understand what was right or wrong about each one, and then finally came to a conclusion through cooperative discussion. In that class, I felt that I understood the material much more than I did in the classes with no collaboration policies. I understand where professors are coming from — it’s not morally acceptable to have students copy straight off one another’s papers. However, that kind of blatant cheating is something that will definitely be caught on the midterm or the final, tests that are worth a significantly greater portion of the final grade than a few problem sets.  The professor of one of the econ classes with a “no collaboration” policy also justified it this way: He said that he wanted to evaluate students’ individual performances without outside influence. That is a valid goal, but one that is much better attained through testing, where professors can be 100-percent certain that students aren’t relying upon preceptors or the Internet or other students. He was essentially treating problem sets like exams; instead of allowing students to practice their skills, every problem set was a mini-exam. With “no collaboration” policies, it becomes much harder to learn the material, which should be the ultimate goal of the class. Time and time again, studies have shown that collaborative learning helps students retain information better than isolated study. In Virginia Tech’s Journal of Technology and Education, a study titled “Collaborative Learning Enhances Critical Thinking” argues that “group diversity in terms of knowledge and experience contributes positively to the learning process.” Problem sets are a valuable part of the learning process. They are practice for applying the concepts that will be tested on the midterm, on the final and perhaps even in real life on the job. A “no collaboration” policy on homework eliminates that benefit.|~|Barbara Zhan is an Operations Research and Financial Engineering major from Plainsboro, N.J.

50183|~|Taking back the weekend|~|   November 24 2013|~|Column | Nov. 24 |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|I cannot tell you how many times I have heard the phrase, “College is the best four years of your life!” Seeing as I am only a little more than a quarter of the way through college, I can’t really vouch for the truth of this statement. But I can say, it has taken me only one year to realize that, much to my dismay, these “best four years” are generally considered so mostly because of the parties and pregames. This is particularly strange for me, because I had fairly low expectations for the party scene at Princeton. But with the University only a mere hour away from New York and an hour (or so) away from Philly, I was confident that my nightlife would be varied, my weekends full of spontaneous trips outside quaint suburbia. With family and friends in New York and Philly, I envisioned myself leaving campus often. Needless to say, classes and train tickets didn’t make these trips very feasible. Moreover, the nightlife on campus was actually decent. Any given Thursday or Saturday, there were a number of pregames and, after learning the system of eating clubs and passes, finding a club to settle into was easy enough. But it only took about three or so nights out to see how this Street culture establishes a repetitive cycle: Find passes, get dressed, pregame, go to the Street and make it to some final destination of your choosing. When I realized this, I grew worried that this monotony would constitute my entire Princeton experience. The year was barely underway, and my friends and I had already found ourselves in a rut. Whether this was a rut of my own doing, or the result of the pressure to not waste my four years here, I can’t say. But I knew If I wanted a change, I would have to create it myself. So I stepped out of that rut. I could drink tea and eat delicious cookies at Murray-Dodge and play Apples to Apples. I could stargaze on the dewy grass and not mind when sprinklers rained over my friends and me. We could stay up and talk about nothing or everything until three in the morning. And if I needed a complete change of scenery, those cities that had once been the home of my imagined social scene were still just a train ride away. New York beckoned with its shows and galleries, Philly with its history and cheesesteaks. But while I realized there were plenty of other adventures to be had outside of the Street, I also discovered that these adventures put off many people. I’d hear “You missed WHAT night at Cottage?” or “You should’ve totally been there for …”’ And to that I say, really? I love going “out” as much as the next person. I love the friends, the mindless dancing, the, ahem, libations. Still, do not ask me if I would rather go to Two Articles night at Cloister or see a show at the Met. I’m going to choose the latter. Because at the end of the day, I’m going to cherish the memory more. I’m going to remember that time I got lost in Union Square, asked four New Yorkers for directions before someone would help me and found out that this particular New Yorker was also heading to the same show. I’m going to remember making the walls of Webster Hall shake as we stomped to the beat of the bass. And I’m going to remember finding a hole-in-the-wall KFC, scarfing down potato wedges and sweet tea on the ride home, giggling with my friend as people gave us annoyed side glances. This is not to say I’ve given up the Street altogether. I’m sure I will continue to frequent it, especially when particular annual events occur. But under no circumstances will I go when I don’t want to. What’s more, there will be just as many nights during which I lounge in random fountains, start Netflix marathons with friends, find shows to attend and, most of all, create those unforgettable memories I hear so much about. If these are to be the “best four years of my life” they cannot be defined by a lackluster cycle of clubs and parties. If there is one word I would use to describe what college should be, I would say adventure. And while one can’t determine what form adventure will arrive in, I can almost certainly say it won’t always rest on a tidy little street in Princeton, N.J. You must go out and find it.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La. She can reached at ltrusty@princeton.edu.

50137|~|Letter to the Editor: Nov. 23, 2013|~|   November 23 2013|~|Letter to the Editor | Nov. 23 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|I worry that we are all too eager to throw away the tradition of the effigies at the urge of various students. Traditions can evolve, but I worry that we are changing tradition at the expense of what the bonfire actually represents. The bonfire has changed from an event to inspire pride in our football team and our school to a social event. This shift was evident last year when it was moved from the night before the Dartmouth game to afterward. Though it was moved at the request of the football team, it signified a turning point — a change in the tone of the event from inspirational to reflective. We reflected on the great year we had, not about what was to come for the Tigers. By taking away the effigies, yet another significant characteristic of the bonfire tradition, we run the risk of diminishing its significance. We are in danger of taking an event that is a symbol of Princeton football pride and turning it into a social event that has fewer grounds in history. “There was this built-in rivalry [with Harvard and Yale] because of Princeton, which was the last of the three to be founded. And this football competition was a natural one, because they’ve always had a natural academic competition.” However, my true goal is to make sure the historical significance of this century’s old tradition has not been lost, that the true spirit of the bonfire is present on Sunday. Just remember that the bonfire exists because the football team worked hard to beat Harvard and Yale, our long-standing rivals. It is a celebration of our football achievements and by extension our Princeton pride, for the Princeton we know today would not be same without our ties to football. I encourage each and every student to go to the bonfire and enjoy it. Cheer on the Tigers, wear your orange and black from head to toe, sing Old Nassau loudly and proudly and most importantly, soak in every moment of this historical event.|~|
49615|~|It's not that we don't care|~|   November 21 2013|~|Column | Nov. 21 |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|Maybe it’s because I grew up near Washington, D.C., but I naturally assume people are engaged and actively involved in politics because, simply put — Public policy impacts you and everything you do. But, across campus, many students are not engaged in political action to try to solve the problems we face. For example, both for the special election on Oct. 16 and the general election on Nov. 5, I was expecting to wait in a long line at Icahn to vote — after all, at home I’ve waited in line for over an hour with my parents. Yet, I was in and out of the polls in five minutes. I ran across only one other voter on both occasions. And what about the lack of student activism regarding other political issues that have plagued our government recently? There have been no organized protests or petitions on campus, either in response to the government shutdown or the NSA eavesdropping on our conversations, to raise public awareness and show policymakers that we students care about these issues. What about the House refusing to take up the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to end discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity? Doesn’t the lack of student protest about these issues, in addition to low voter turnout, speak to a problem on campus? Don’t get me wrong; I don’t think Princeton students are apathetic. Go up to anyone in the library or dining hall, push the right buttons, and I’m sure he’ll go on for hours, talking your ear off about the fall of the Roman Empire or the discovery of the Higgs boson or, yes, even about his support of gay rights. Students here clearly have issues that they care deeply about. So, it isn’t a lack of caring in general; it’s a problem with taking political action. Why don’t those full-house political debates at Whig-Clio equate to voting or protests? Even when issues are debated, these discussions do not lead students to take action to change the situation. Maybe students feel like they will not have much of an impact outside the Orange Bubble. Because within the boundaries of Princeton, students are willing to take a stand. Just consider the “What Is Marriage?” talk by Ryan Anderson — the crowd was full of students peacefully questioning his traditional stance. And other groups work to raise awareness of issues across campus — there are events, tables at Frist, etc. But that’s the problem: The discussion is often limited to campus issues. Princeton tends to be an extremely isolated community, and the college town isn’t much better. When people feel as though they interact only with other students, they are less likely to try to break out and impact other people. But are we truly living in a bubble? In reality, we are connected to the entire national and global community. Just as the important research that happens here impacts the world, so, too, could student activism. Students might feel as though they cannot do anything because they are trapped by this mythical bubble, but, in reality, there is no actual bubble. It is the use of the phrase “Orange Bubble” that gives legitimacy to being a bystander, but this is merely a case of justifying-by-labeling, and, in reality, our surroundings are not a legitimate justification for inaction. The limited engagement Princeton students feel with the outside world affects whether and how they take action, but it shouldn’t. The only way people will make a difference is if they think they can make a difference. And it’s time for students to branch out and impact a broader crowd. Just as Princeton research impacts the nation, national issues have real ramifications for Princeton students; we should care more about these broader issues because they really do effect us too. Last month the Supreme Court took up an affirmative action case, and there was barely any discussion of that across campus — an issue that clearly impacts college students. Even the government shutdown affects student life. It temporarily cut off some research funding on campus, and it certainly harms the national economy and effectiveness of our political system, all of which impacts you. Pell Grant funding? Higher interest rates for college loans? That’s all the national government. Princeton has prepared us well to debate problems the world faces. But talking isn’t sufficient to make a difference. Students need to take action on the issues they care about. Whether it is small local changes or joining with others to affect national politics, youth can impact change. Just think of the 2008 election, when many of the volunteers who reached out to swing voters were kids who were excited about making a difference. And the youth vote did matter. Were students to organize a protest over major issues, like NSA surveillance or affirmative action, at a school of national prominence, it would attract media interest and capture the attention of key policy makers. So, if there is an issue you care about, think about what you can actually do to make a difference. Then go out and do it.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C.

49942|~|The media who cried meningitis|~|   November 21 2013|~|Column | Nov. 21 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Walking outside, one can see the many TV vans that clutter Nassau Street and the reporters — microphones in hand and cameramen in tow — who have invaded campus. And no, they aren’t here to cover the football team. Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts described it as a “serious scare” and “potentially deadly.” Time Magazine labeled it a “campus contagion.” Businessweek chose the moniker, “meningitis crisis.” The recent news of the FDA’s approval of Princeton’s decision to import a foreign vaccine has sparked an unusual amount of media attention. While most students find the extra attention amusing, competing among friends to see who can appear in the most TV interviews or get the funniest questions about the disease from home, the media attention may be more harmful than entertaining. The media’s colorful usage of language portrays the campus as a hotbed of some mystery disease that will lead to a real life World War Z. As if overnight, the situation on campus has erupted into a contagion that needs to be quarantined. Fears of bacterial meningitis even prompted one concerned commenter on NBC to write, “Great! Put the students and faculty in airplanes, buses, cars, ships and trains and then send them all over the U.S. for the Thanksgiving holiday, where they can spread the disease to the entire country.” When these descriptions are juxtaposed with reality, it is a little hard not to laugh. Granted, bacterial meningitis is no joke. It is a serious disease and the University’s decision to import the vaccine is unquestionably a good one. That being said, it is hard not to compare the concern of family and friends in the form of extremely cautious calls and texts to our relatively unchanged everyday lives. In light of the concern, it is important to remember several important facts. It is avoidable by taking simple precautions such as covering your mouth, washing your hands and not sharing cups or utensils. As reported several days after the coverage began, meningitis is “unlikely” to spread on campus. Only seven cases have been reported in the last few months. And between the beginning of the media coverage and beforehand, the situation has remained unchanged. However, in the process of hearing this repeated message over and over, we contrast this image of contagion and viral disease that the media creates with our relatively normal lives. Classes are still scheduled. Student events are still being held. And on a campus of over 5,000 undergrads, not many have been personally affected. There is no dome or men in hazmat suits. When we see that, in fact, relatively little has changed, we will trick ourselves into easing our caution and concern. This is evident in our amusement that competing teams refuse to shake our hands without gloves or import their own water to home games; our usage of the “Mine. Not Yours.” red meningitis prevention cups as decoration; and our labeling of the disease as the “Meng,” satirizing the darker image that the media presents. We just aren’t taking it seriously. Yet, the worst thing we can do is put our guard down. When we no longer see bacterial meningitis as something that we should be cautious of, but rather as something comical that can be taken lightly, or even worse ignored, we are putting ourselves more at risk than in any other way. The best way to prevent it is by doing relatively simple things. When the bar is raised, however, and the media creates this impression that we need to perform Herculean feats to avoid a relatively non-present disease, our desire to take any of the precautions at all seriously, even the smaller ones, decreases. The real fear is that when a health problem actually arrives in the future, it may be hard to take it seriously again in light of the current response. And when the media cries meningitis again, maybe no one will listen.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu. 
49938|~|Fight with brain and brawn|~|   November 21 2013|~|Column | Nov. 21 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|You can hardly say I was raised on football. For me, NFL stands for  “National Forensics League” and phrases like “The USS Enterprise Carrier is nearly four football fields long” were more confusing than helpful. But we did have the Broncos’ 1997 Super Bowl victory on VHS, and I shared with my boyhood peers pick-up football and the same sort of generalized admiration for Broncos stars from John Elway to Jason Elam. More important than the sport itself, though, were the rituals it begot — my family has always observed the de facto national holiday that is Super Bowl Sunday, and some of my fondest childhood memories include a football game running in the background to friendship and community. Upon reaching Princeton, as a member of the band, I have followed (literally!) Tiger football more closely than I ever expected to. But, as it was back home, it is the communal traditions we build around football — from waking up early Saturday morning to drum cadences to (no longer) burning John Harvard in effigy — that are far more memorable and important than the day-to-day of the game itself. Ivy League football — with its dynamic players and long history of intense rivalries — is a perfect backdrop for traditions that create a Princeton identity, from band to bonfire. Those readers who haven’t spent much time on a football field (or even those who spend most of their time there actually playing football) may not be familiar with the rivalry between high school marching bands and football teams. Think “American Pie”: “The players tried to take the field/The marching band refused to yield.” Like the one-way rivalries between Penn and Princeton or Princeton and Yale, that between bands and football teams across the nation is played out in oft-silly self-aggrandizement on one side and indifference on the other. Bands jokingly ask what the football players are doing on “our” field or lobby for the recognition of marching band as a varsity sport, while football players … play football. Having spent most of my high school career among bandies, I recognized this sentiment and expected it when I joined the Princeton band but was surprised to find little of the bitterness, real or contrived. Instead, we do as much as possible to be the team’s best fans, in our own ironic, quirky, off-color way. With everything from ironic ignorance of the game’s rules (yelling for our offensive backs “to hit a homer”) to outright violence (“Knives! Knives! Knives!), we support the team when other students leave. This is true whether we are cheering on the team through consecutive 1-9 seasons or staying through the fourth quarter despite being down 24-10 to Harvard. And it was also true watching the Tigers steamroll the Bulldogs in last week’s record-breaking victory. It’s when football shines, though, that it becomes a rallying point campus-wide. As much as die-hards like to scorn fair-weather fans, the energy that a high-achieving football team brings to campus is exhilarating and well worth a few poor seasons. The energy doesn’t come from mere victories, however. Princeton football this year and Ivy football in general is particularly exciting for a number of reasons. On the field, Princeton’s dynamic no-huddle offense has been a pleasure to watch, drawing notice for its record-breaking number of points this season (and still one game to go) and its mercurial habit of switching among three quarterbacks, occasionally all on the field at once. Junior Quinn Epperly’s ability to think on his feet and make plays in and out of the pocket adds a level of excitement rare in today’s paradigm of static, well-protected passers. It’s enough to make me relive foggy memories of John Elway’s scrambles (and recover somewhat from the failed promises that Tim Tebow brought to Broncos country). Off the field, Ivy football has done much to limit the problems plaguing schools with richer, more successful programs. By declining to grant athletic scholarships and attaching an academic index to recruiting practices, the league has done much to support the ideal of the student-athlete. Many, including Nathan Mathabane ’13 in his column last year, have discussed the perceived advantage that athletes have during the admission process, but such policies on the league and University scale ensure that such advantages are minor, if extant at all. And besides, it is a small-minded view of talent to claim a student-athlete spending years training mind and body is less deserving of Princeton than a student who has focused exclusively on pursuits of the mind. One Ivy policy Princeton might reconsider, though, is that of refusing bids in the FCS national tournament — officials have expressed concerns over academic conflicts for a team traveling to a national tournament in early December, but, with Princeton finals already pushed into the new year, I see no reason for the Tigers not to compete if the team is interested. So huzzah for Tiger football — win or lose in Hanover tomorrow, they are already champions and will return to a student body cheering for the success of their classmates, for an exciting sport and victory in their long rivalries and the chance to watch the flames paint Nassau Hall and West College and Whig and Clio Halls bright Princeton orange.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a sophomore from Littleton, Colo.

49805|~|Living in parallel |~|   November 21 2013|~|Column | Nov. 21 |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|When he walked out on stage, I could hardly have missed him. How could I, when he’s six-foot-six? But more so because a feeling of incongruence immediately came over me. Standing on stage in a tailcoat, white bowtie and borrowed vintage Yale snapback was one of my best friends from high school, now a member of the Yale Glee Club. The moment they walked onto the stage, my mind was in a strange way thrown into trying to rationalize an inherent contradiction. Why someone who I was so used to seeing in my high school auditorium and refectory would now find himself in Richardson or in Whitman. In that blending of two distinct worlds, two separate chapters of our lives, there was something inherently unsettling. No one else from my high school grade had come to Princeton. In coming here, part of my social psychology was therefore that I had to make a whole new set of friends, and I wouldn’t have the crutch of knowing people from my high school. I text and stay in touch with my friends from home, but on some level I was compartmentalizing. Home friends existed in a world totally separate from the one of midterms and eating clubs and writing columns for the ‘Prince’ really late at night. This is not to say that I don’t miss seeing those friends on a daily basis, going through the same classes and tests and rehearsals and practices and in essence having our lives move in parallel. Having a high school grade of 51, where most people had the same few classes, the same few teachers and participated in the same few clubs made us an incredibly close group of people. Whenever you bombed a test, you could commiserate with basically anyone in the grade, because they had just taken it too. And when you had some inside joke or quirk from a class, you could share it with anyone because they’d know exactly the people and situations you were describing. College, by contrast, can seem isolating. In a small high school, everyone is fighting the same battles and enjoying the same successes. Even at a job, though the motivations may be different, the people in an office can on some level share in this. But in college, because not everyone has the same parallel goals, struggles and accomplishments, perhaps you identify less harmoniously with your friends. You can empathize with their problems and accomplishments less closely. Charlotte Chun brought up this argument in a column a few weeks ago: The individuality that comes with college can be lonely. On some level, this is true. Friends are made in college through the shared environment of all living within a few minutes’ walk of each other and the social benefits of all being on campus. And while you can’t directly identify with the work they’re up late doing, when you’re both in the library at some ungodly hour just trying to get it done, you do empathize with each other. But some part of me does long to return to an environment where every single person is working in concert to a parallel end. In the formative years of middle and high school, I believe this close group ethic is exactly the right one, providing a sense of camaraderie that shows you that you aren’t the only one struggling and that you are in a place where you are known and understood. However, applied to college, that strategy wouldn’t work. If college is supposed to be the ultimate preparation for the “real world,” then it is good that not everyone you know has exactly the same problems and experiences as you. Having your own struggles and a group less in tune with each others’ problems forces you to grow. It allows for everyone, furthermore, to explore new paths that they choose to, instead of following a set standard course. You can follow your passions more easily if you accept that not everyone will share them. You will never feel like a parallel version of another person here. The individuality and independence that comes with college, while often isolating, is also a good thing. It’s a trade-off for more liberty to explore and grow as an academic and as a person.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass. He can be reached at rdukeman@princeton.edu. 
49804|~|The importance of being earnest|~|   November 21 2013|~|Column | Nov. 20 |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I believe that genuineness is a central core of the human condition, and that without it much of what it means to be human is lost — a deeply metaphysical claim for a freshman who doesn’t even really know what metaphysics is. Yet psychologists, counselors, philosophers and even businessmen agree that authenticity is necessary for any type of real connection to flourish. For any true relationship to exist stably, it must have a true foundation — a genuine foundation. Despite this, the art of being genuine faces a crisis in today’s American era of go. The more you can accomplish in a day, the better. We perceive pressures and expectations (either imagined or real) from both society and our peers that drive us forward, whatever the means. And with the rise of the technological revolution, a large portion of our interactions now occur over the Internet — whether through email, social media or messaging — giving us the incredible power to manicure the image we present of ourselves. We can perfect our rhetoric at our own leisure without the same pressures of real-time conversation or confrontation and ensure that we are left standing with our best foot forward. But we are creating an idealized and distorted appearance for ourselves, eliminating flaws and vulnerabilities. I am just as guilty of any of these acts; indeed, they seem so universal that at first they appear blameless. But as genuineness is slowly undermined, severe consequences begin to emerge. Carl Rogers, an influential psychologist of the 20th century, asserted that “genuineness, acceptance and empathy” were all necessary for personal growth. Rogers is not alone, either — a common principle of relationship psychology is the belief that trust is crucial for any sort of bond to be long lasting. Such trust is essential even to business relationships; an article published in the Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing and entitled “Vulnerability in business relationships” concluded that “trust is important in lean business relationships.” And where can trust come from, if not from sincerity? Without it, real friendships cannot be created, slowly isolating us as individual islands each struggling for its own advancement. While we search for ways to make more money and meet more people and know more things, we sometimes allow our ambition to supersede our genuineness. We begin to see people as a means rather than an end, and we build friendships to further our careers rather than to enlighten our lives. At Princeton, these empty alliances are most evident in the social atmosphere. The most exclusive eating clubs are the most popular eating clubs (probably precisely because they are exclusive), and the only way to gain entrance is with the right-colored piece of paper or a name on a list. Both passes and lists, however, require only one condition: that one knows a member of the club who is willing to grant them one mode of entrance or the other. The premise makes sense, yet the consequences are horrendous. Underclassmen seek friendships with upperclassman members for the primary purpose of establishing a means to receive passes, pawning their companionship for their own gain instead of for the pleasure of the other’s company. Pleasantries are exchanged and favors completed, but with no earnestness. Cultures lacking genuineness can only create similar hollow acquaintances, acquaintances that are easily reneged if either party decides that there are more advantageous options available to them. And in losing our ability to form genuine relationships, we start to lose a part of what it is to be human. We are social animals, and if our interactions are poisoned by worries of being cast off as soon as is convenient for our “friends,” then no intimate level of connection can ever be reached. The culture evolving as we become more preoccupied with our personal status at the expense of our authenticity is not a sustainable one. The trend may not be universal, but it is real. We cannot allow it to progress further without action, however, or else we risk a fundamental part of the human experience. Instead of treating people we encounter as temporary fixtures in our life to be drained of use and eventually discarded, we must make them an end in and of themselves. Connections made purely for advanced opportunity can still be authentic, so long as they are not disguised as anything else. Be genuine and transparent; there still is importance in being earnest.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz. He can be reached at mjhammer@princeton.edu.

49787|~|Speak, woman!|~|   November 21 2013|~|Column | Nov. 20 |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|In one of my seminars last week, all of the male students happened to leave the classroom during the break while a few women stayed behind. Our professor chatted casually with the three or four female students who felt no need to obey the call of nature (a rarity in a predominantly female three-hour seminar), and then, rising from her chair with an earnest expression, addressed us all very seriously. “Girls,” she said, “don’t be afraid to talk in class.” These words, half encouragement and half rebuke, have become a surprisingly familiar refrain in my classes this semester. Three months ago I sat in a lecture room in Lewis Library listening to a panel of three men discuss contemporary political and religious issues related to the city of Jerusalem. Although the audience — about 10 students — had an even gender ratio, only men were asking questions. The conversation moved to Women of the Wall, a controversial Jerusalem-based prayer group, and I began to raise my hand to ask a question. I was preempted by one of the panelists who felt obliged to point out that the women in the room weren’t talking. He added that he often observed this dynamic in academic settings and wanted to make sure that women had a chance to participate. I raised my hand — but much more self-consciously than I would have had he kept his observation to himself. All of the sudden, my act of joining the conversation was a statement about gender and equality. I became an unwilling representative of all women everywhere. My participation was the gift of the empathetic man at the front of the classroom who sensitively opened up a politically charged conversation to the overshadowed, intimidated girls. I walked out of the room feeling patronized and incensed. One of the female participants approached me and said she was puzzled by the panelist’s insistence that women speak up. She had not refrained from asking questions because of gender-related shyness. “I just didn’t have anything to say,” she explained. I have heard speakers and teachers point out gender patterns in classroom settings three different times this year. Each time I come away with the same message: Women, speak up. Ask questions. Be confident. As a feminist, I should be celebrating this symptom of widespread awareness about classroom behavioral disparity. It’s an issue I care a lot about. Instead, I find myself oscillating between confusion, guilt and frustration: Confusion because I did not perceive a gender-equality problem where the speaker did, guilt for being part of the problem I failed to notice and frustration once I decide that the problem is, in these specific situations, more a result of the speaker’s hypersensitivity than of female academic insecurity. In the seminar described above, I had observed a general awkward restraint that day coming from most of my peers, but the lack of participation was in no way divided along X and Y chromosome lines. In a different course, a professor pointed out during her first lecture of the year that women were not asking questions. In her second lecture, only women asked questions. I half expected the professor to comment on the striking reversal, encouraging men to speak up — in the interest of gender parity, right? No such announcement was made. There is a real problem in coed academic environments of women remaining silent because of intimidation and discomfort. I have personally experienced this phenomenon often enough to appreciate its potency. But intellectual insecurity is not the only reason women choose not to talk in lectures and precepts. In my experience, my female peers are much less likely to participate solely for the sake of participation. We tend to speak when we have something worthwhile to say, and we tend to think before we speak. Has our sensitivity toward women’s behavior led us to the point where we are demanding that they speak when they have nothing to say and ask questions that have not been carefully thought out? If anything, we should be discouraging men from these behaviors, not pushing women toward them. Dear faculty and staff, and all feminists of either gender who are on their guard against a harmful gender divide in classrooms: Thank you for your vigilance, but please be as sensitive to the implications of your gender-based public reprimands as you are to the ratio of men and women actively participating in class. When authority figures urge women to speak up in class, they imply that female students who do not ask questions are guilty of perpetuating an academic gender gap or worse, that they are the pitiful victims of a society which programs them to fear and give ground to their male peers. In some situations, this may actually be true, but in others, women’s relative silence is a fluke or a result of much more complex factors than socialized female timidity. We deserve to be treated as individuals, not as a composite species suffering from academic disabilities. So the next time not enough women are participating, wait a minute or a day to make sure your diagnosis is correct. Better yet, ask them why they’re not speaking.

49670|~|How anti-Semitism made me care about Israel|~|   November 19 2013|~|Column | Nov. 19 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|I’m anti-Semitic. Well, at least, that’s what people were saying. I’d noticed in recent weeks that certain friends had seemed more distant than usual, but I blew it off. I didn’t realize the reason for the coldness until I found out that a friend had considered some of my comments overly critical of Israel and was telling people that I was anti-Semitic. He was one of my first friends on campus: We were paired as lab partners and often had political discussions during class. Eventually, one of our topics turned to Israel. I expressed the beliefs that would cause my ostracism: that Israel’s building of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza was illegal, and, moreover, antagonistic to the peace process. I knew that having these feelings didn’t mean that I was anti-Israel, but my friend bought into the false dichotomy that has dominated conversations about Israel for too long: that to be pro-Israel meant to unilaterally support every Israeli policy and that to be anything else was to be anti-Israel, and even worse, anti-Semitic. I was indignant after hearing my friend’s reaction, even hurt, but, above all, confused at how our friendly discussion had led to such a claim. How could one of my best friends here think of me as something that I consider so fundamentally abhorrent? It was this experience during my freshman year that made me care so much about Israel. I realized that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not something that people can just engage in casual debate about — at least not for those who feel intimately connected. To many Jews and many Palestinians, control of that small sliver of land bordering the Mediterranean is fundamentally connected to their personal identity. I naively came into the debate merely as a scholarly exercise — informed, interested, but disengaged. From that experience with my friend, I realized that although I may not have grown up with a personal connection to Israel or Palestine, I could — should — still have a stake in these issues. I was actually in a perfect position to help resolve this conflict: Not identifying with either side was not an impediment, but in fact, an advantage. Fortunately, around the same time as this realization, a group centered around ending the conflict was getting started. A few students, dismayed by the one-sided, “blindly supportive or bust,” nature of any campus debate concerning Israel, started a Princeton chapter of J Street U, the student branch of the national political advocacy organization working toward a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On Tuesday, the president and founder of J Street and a Princeton alumnus, Jeremy Ben-Ami ’84, gave a speech on campus calling for us — as Americans, as college students and as concerned individuals of all identities — to rise up for peace and pressure our public officials to continue to push for a final resolution to this conflict: a two-state solution. Why two states? The answer requires only a brief look at Israel’s history: four wars, two Palestinian uprisings, persistent terrorist attacks and tens of thousands of deaths on both sides — Israeli and Arab. The entire 65 years of Israel’s existence starkly expose the infeasibility of peaceful coexistence within one state. Seeking a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not idealistic —  it’s imperative. Just as Jews yearned for a state of their own, a Jewish democracy, in the land of their forefathers, so too do the Palestinians seek an independent state, where they are free to express their own national identity in their own ancestral homeland. America is involved in many affairs around the world — perhaps too many. But this is not just another issue for America to intercalate itself into. America is already intimately involved. Since WWII, Israel has been the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. aid. America was instrumental in garnering global support for the establishment of a Jewish state. We have engaged in extensive diplomatic, economic and military cooperation with Israel ever since. America has been integral in the peace process. In fact, the United States has brokered every negotiation between Israel and its Arab neighbors. This July, Secretary of State John Kerry convinced the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government to restart stalled peace talks. This issue is too divisive for those directly involved; the role of the United States as a third-party facilitator is essential. Above all, the leaders of these governments look to the United States for support in making the tough choices necessary for peace.  A peaceful resolution to this conflict has eluded state actors for decades, but never before have we been been so close to peace. And it will only happen with our help. The American people need to pressure their leaders for continued engagement. Moreover, we, as Princeton students, need to be actively involved. Most civil rights movement activists were in their 20s; Vietnam War protests started on college campuses. We are fundamental in building the “great constituency for peace” that Secretary Kerry called for as essential to ending this conflict. Resolving this decades-old conflict could be our generation’s movement for justice. J Street, spearheaded by Ben-Ami, is working to change our country’s broken politics on the issue, because without continued American leadership, the parties will never reach a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Join our efforts on campus in pushing for peace. The question is not “Will America be involved?” but rather, “How will we shape America’s involvement?” J Street is shaping the conversation about the conflict to support peace and justice.

49702|~|Editorial: Students should consider the meningitis vaccine|~|   November 19 2013|~|Editorial | Nov. 19 |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|The Editorial Board strongly supports ongoing efforts to provide students with information about the current cases of infection with the N. meningitidis bacteria on our campus and to continue to promote cautious behavior. In view of recent events, the Board recommends that students strongly consider receiving the vaccine against serogroup B to be made available next month. Meningococcal disease remains a serious concern in the United States. The rate of mortality is 10-15 percent and long-term effects of infection are seen in 10-20 percent of survivors. A recent outbreak in Ohio involved a serogroup B strain like the one here at Princeton. Over three years, there were 13 cases on that campus despite a concerted effort to limit saliva contact, and there was a fatality in that Ohio outbreak. Thus, the current measures being taken to stop this epidemic at Princeton will not prove fully effective. Swabbing and culturing for possible carriers is of no value in deciding who should receive antibiotic prophylaxis, since carriage of N. meningitidis is variable and there is no consistent relationship between that found in the normal population and in an epidemic. Measures to avoid saliva exchange, while commendable, are impossible to enforce universally — especially not on Prospect Avenue. Even after receiving a vaccine, students must remain cautious; eating club presidents should consider temporarily suspending any activities and drinking games with a particularly high risk of transmitting the disease. The serogroup B vaccine is approved and has been utilized in Australia and Europe, and approval by the CDC for use on our campus implies a high level of confidence about the safety of the vaccine. While we recognize the desire for a voluntary and non-compulsory implementation plan, we raise the following caveat. To eradicate an epidemic, there is a phenomenon called “herd immunity” that will protect a population even if all members are not immune. If close to 80 percent of our community needs to be immunized before herd immunity is achieved, for example, it is unclear if a voluntary vaccination program will achieve this threshold. Because of the group benefits of individual vaccinations, the Board urges individuals to strongly consider receiving the vaccination. There also remain questions to be answered. What is the exact strain at Princeton? It was ST-269 studied by the CDC on the Ohio campus. It is important to determine whether the strain seen in patients this fall is exactly the same as the one in the spring, and if it is related to others previously reported, in order to judge the virulence. If this data is available, the CDC should be transparent. It is only through continued transparency and communication that our community can be empowered to make the right preventive health decisions.|~|Abstaining: Zach Horton

49595|~|Brace yourselves, meningitis is coming|~|   November 19 2013|~|Column | Nov. 19 |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|Shout it in the streets. Spam the email inboxes. And, for god’s sake, somebody put an article in the ‘Prince.’ Autumn is coming to an end, we are severely unprepared, and meningitis is coming. The fatalities are multiplying, and soon the dead will rise again as throngs of the … six, you say? Only six students and a visitor have been diagnosed with meningitis? Well, the term “outbreak” is thrown around rather loosely nowadays, isn’t it? Last weekend, I received a frantic call from my mother telling me to get the new vaccine as soon as it’s available. My response was, “What vaccine?” She claimed that Princeton had made national news as a result of meningitis and spoke of some new European vaccine. I was skeptical, to say the least, but lo and behold, a quick Internet search found headlines everywhere proclaiming the outbreak of meningitis on the Princeton campus. There was even a clip of Lester Holt warning the nation about the “increasing sense of urgency” surrounding our campus on the NBC Nightly News. I guess I didn’t get the memo. Granted, I may have been unusually uninformed. Most students I talked to afterward already knew about the vaccine. The increasing sense of urgency, however, was nowhere to be found. When one thinks of an outbreak, images of overflowing hospitals, ailing people in the streets and probably at least one fatality come to mind. My sympathies go out to all those students who have had to deal with this illness, but I would hardly call seven cases an outbreak. More importantly, I am not an outlier. Few students I’ve spoken to are taking this seriously at all. I’ve never even heard meningitis referenced in conversation beyond the sly quip about avoiding “the menge.” Frankly, if I had not had such a concerned mother, meningitis would never have crossed my mind. Then again, I’m not a doctor. Perhaps, semantically speaking, based on statistics and calculations by the Centers for Disease Control, this is technically an outbreak. I’ll even concede that meningitis is a serious disease with serious risks. However, when headlines start using words like “outbreak,” “urgency,” “emergency,” etc., they are implying something beyond the technical definition of outbreak. The media seems to be implying a cultural change, a noticeable increase in the anxiety we are feeling on a day-to-day basis. At the very least, news reports are suggesting that students widely acknowledge this as a serious problem, which simply isn’t true. There is a clear distinction between the way the headlines are portraying the situation and the way we, as students, are experiencing it. Then again, maybe I’m being brash and insensitive. Maybe seven cases of meningitis actually do imply a serious health threat to students. Maybe Lester Holt was right all along. But then there is another, potentially much more serious problem with this situation.  If meningitis is posing as serious a health risk as the news suggests, then why doesn’t anybody care? Obviously, as students, we are wrapped up in our daily chores of homework, extracurriculars and athletics. If this is something we should actually be worried about, then the University has failed to get that point across. I’ve gotten enough emails to know not to share water bottles, to always wash my hands and to never kiss girls. But emails will not change behaviors so easily. If we never seriously think of meningitis as a threat, why would we ever go out of our way to change our daily routines? We have enough on our minds already, and six cases of students falling ill are hardly enough to hold our attention for very long. The administration seems to think this is serious enough to warrant some kind of European vaccine. It would be great if, in the meantime, it let the students know that this is something we should actually be concerned about (and I’m not talking about another email). If students need to take this seriously, then certainly the University needs to as well. Either the headlines are blowing this out of proportion or students are ignoring a serious threat to their well-being. Either way, something doesn’t match up. Of course, I’m more inclined to believe what I see, not what I hear from Lester Holt and USA Today. So while the world keeps its eyes fixed upon our little campus, praying for the control of this deadly outbreak, I will continue not thinking or caring about it in any way.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pa.

49410|~|The, like, epidemic|~|   November 18 2013|~|Column | Nov. 18 |~|Lauren Davis|~|   Columnist     |~|In middle school in England, my friends and I used to entertain ourselves by exchanging overdrawn imitations of the stereotypical American valley girl: “Let’s, like, go to the mall!” “OMG, I like, love, like, that shirt!” Feeling smug, I sniggered and mocked, certain I’d never actually talk that way. So I was horrified a few weeks ago when I relistened to an interview I had done for a journalism assignment and discovered that the word “like” featured in almost every sentence. As I played back the recording, I hoped desperately that I’d start to sound the way I thought I had during the hour-long conversation: thoughtful, mature and articulate. I didn’t. I barely recognized myself as I listened to that recording, and not just because it can be strange to hear your own voice. The word “like” had infected the way I spoke like a verbal chicken pox: an ugly, conspicuous blemish cropping up everywhere and anywhere. I unwittingly used it to fill pauses, link sentences together and modify words. I used it when I had something to say and when I had nothing to say. Worst of all, “like” had become so reflexive and entrenched in my speech pattern that I have no conscious memory of ever using it in the interview. I am not an uncertain person. I am often passionate, and probably talk too much. So I never thought that I could come across as anything other than assertive and confident. I work hard in my written work to condense my points down to the essentials and not add needless filler words. Yet, clearly, my speech does not reflect this at all. That one little word made me sound young, uncertain and immediately less intelligent. I don’t notice the word “like” much in a social setting, when chatting with friends. But in a more formal setting — in a class or a job interview — it becomes conspicuous and could have implications on the way we are perceived. Do we really want a verbal tic to compromise the content of our arguments or how respect-worthy we are deemed by our peers, professors and down the line, employers, clients, employees? The “like” epidemic is rampant here on campus and throughout our generation. Our use of it as a conversation filler is infectious and mutually reinforcing — the more our friends use it, the more we use it and vice versa. Our brains are constantly adapting, subconsciously, to the patterns of speech we hear every day, helping us to fit into our environment and communicate more smoothly. I’ve focused on the use of “like,” but there are other verbal trends creeping into our day-to-day communication. Alternative filler words such as “you know,” “um” or “literally” have also become common. Then there is “uptalk,” when intonation rises at the end of a sentence as if asking a question, or “vocal fry,” a raspy, Kesha-like tone that has recently been observed in women. Everyone picks up a different tendency. There’s a chance I’m overreacting. Perhaps it is my British background that makes me so inclined to view these language trends as “bad habits.” Certain linguists have actually argued that modern vocal trends are important for defining a culture and for improving the fluency with which we interact, even asserting that “like” or “uptalking” are ways of becoming more relatable or assertive. However, the stereotype — especially for young women — remains that these language trends denote insecurity, silliness or immaturity. Despite the linguists’ academic arguments, social perception matters. I highly doubt that any job interviewer down the line would find my excessive use of “like” to be impressive. Walking across campus over the past few weeks, I’ve made a point to listen in more closely on other people’s conversations, and I am both reassured and concerned that the majority heavily feature “like.” My similarity to others of my generation explains why my speech has become the way it is, but the incredible prevalence of our thoughtless speech habits also serves as a warning that we ought to be more aware of them. “Like” is at its heart a way of rushing through sentences somewhat thoughtlessly without pausing to deliberate. Perhaps this habit is a symptom of youth mixed with fast-paced modern life — of a generation-wide impatience that is only exacerbated by our ability to constantly check email and Facebook? I’m not sure, but that’s my working theory. I’m glad I was shocked by the way I sounded in that interview, as it made me aware of the contrast between how differently I perceived myself when my speech was riddled with “likes” from the way I perceive myself as I write this article. It’s no easy feat to change an ingrained behavior, but I now make a point to try to pause and allow myself time to think about what I want to say, instead of instinctively filling the gap with “like.” Maybe if we all work together, we can beat the habit.

49443|~|Remembering I'm Asian|~|   November 18 2013|~|Column | Nov. 18 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|A couple weeks ago, Benjamin Dinovelli wrote a column titled “Forgetting I’m Asian.” In it, he describes his struggles with the notion of cultural identity as an ethnically Asian student raised by white parents. My situation is not perfectly synonymous to his, but I can relate to his experiences of trying to reconcile a name with a sense of personal and cultural identity. However, my experience is not one of forgetting my ethnic heritage, but rather one of remembering it. My full name is Laura Jiyoon Kim. Having attended international schools since preschool, it may have been prudent to have gone by my more Western and pronounceable first name. However, throughout my entire life, I have only ever been called Jiyoon by teachers, family and friends. I don’t recall exactly when I first learned about my official first name. I do know that it wasn’t until several years had passed since I learned to introduce myself as Jiyoon. As a child, I resented my unfamiliar name. I couldn’t fathom why my parents had given me a name my own mother couldn’t pronounce. In Korean, there is no distinction between the letters ‘l’ and ‘r’; “Laura” includes both and so gets muddled when uttered in a Korean accent. I eventually learned that my parents had asked a close family friend to give me my “American name.” I came to terms with it but decided that “Laura” just wasn’t a name I felt represented how I identify my heritage and myself. Jiyoon is the name I grew up with. Jiyoon is the name my parents meticulously picked because of its relative simplicity in Korean, Japanese and even English spellings and pronunciations. Jiyoon is the name that lets the world know that I’m Korean, even when my passport is issued by the United States and Japan is where I consider home. However, as I prepared to leave for college, my conviction to embrace the inconveniences that inevitably come with having an Asian name in a Western academic environment was shaken. Was I prepared to repeat myself over and over whenever I introduced myself throughout the awkward transitional phase when every freshman is trying to learn everyone else’s name? I’d already experienced the mildly horrifying embarrassment of watching a professor struggle to pronounce my name in front of a lecture hall of exasperated students during a summer academic program. I almost thought I would fit in better if I had an American name, instead of one that printed the label “international student” across my forehead. I was even concerned with factors that had little to do the Asian nature of my preferred name and more to do with simple logistical issues. Laura being my official first name, I knew that class rosters, official documents and even the cheesy sign that I was sure I would find on my dorm room door would say “Laura.” My Princeton netID was already set as “ljkim.” Fortunately, since the beginning of this fall semester, Princeton has implemented a system that allows students to indicate a preferred first name on SCORE. I was spared the burden of having to decide between a sense of identity and convenience. It was already late August when the email announcement for this new system was sent out, and I hadn’t yet made a decision. I copped out, letting a system make the choice I couldn’t quite make for myself. The “American name” is a phenomenon I’ve become increasingly sensitive to in my first few months at a college in the States. Unlike me, there are many Asian students on campus who prefer to be called by an American name. At one of the initial Korean American Student Association gatherings, I was overwhelmed by the challenge of having to learn both American and Korean names. I have friends who have actually chosen their adopted American name as their preferred name on SCORE. For some, an American name is a true preference or what they’ve always gone by. But for others, it’s merely a choice of convenience. In some extreme cases, students pick an American name they like in preparation for an extended period of time at an American academic institution, as though it’s the last item on a checklist of things to pack before hopping on an international flight to college. I’m not speaking to those who have never gone by, or don’t even possess, an Asian name, or to those who genuinely prefer their American name. But I would like to urge those who have adopted an American name merely for the sake of convenience to consider taking the extra energy and time to introduce themselves by the name they prefer. A name holds power. It is a fundamental form of personal identification. Those who care and who matter will take the time to learn the name you believe most accurately represents yourself. I, for one, have learned how exactly to explain my name so that others can learn it with relative ease — it’s like June, but with an ‘ee’ sound in the middle.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan.

49425|~|Pressurizing our passions|~|   November 18 2013|~|Column | Nov. 18 |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|In her Nov. 13 column, “Pursuing our passions,” Prianka Misra proposes that classes should “adopt a more applied philosophy and utilize an involved approach to assignments and activities, teaching students the problem-solving strategies that are reflected in the real world.” Misra discusses her experience in Professor John Danner’s interactive and application-heavy class, “Special Topics in Social Entrepreneurship: Ventures to Address Global Challenges.” The class allows students to delve into a “pre-professional realm of academics” by letting them apply the concepts they learn to their own venture ideas. While classes like Danner’s certainly offer students a new approach to learning about real-world subjects such as economic sustainability and entrepreneurship, Misra’s vision of the ideal course is not easily applicable to courses in other concentrations and could even be detrimental to the learning process of students in STEM fields. Speaking as a science major, many of my classes require substantial amounts of memorization. I often see my classmates cramming weeks before exams trying to memorize the pathways of biochemical processes or the mechanisms of various species interactions. The main goal of these courses is to acquire enough foundational knowledge so that we can apply the concepts in the distant future. While many science classes also have a lab portion, which provides that hands-on experience that Misra advocates, the labs teach simple techniques developed by other accomplished scientists and researchers. These classes acknowledge that we, as students, are far from having enough of a background in science to create revolutionary experiments that can contribute to the fields in which we are interested. After all, safety, experience and a body of knowledge can only be acquired through study and time. In effect, we’re paying our dues so that we can develop the skills of a respected professional. In this way, labs and similarly, STEM seminars, allow students to shape their thinking so that they will have more polished, directed ways of thinking for when they want to make their own discovery, invention or theory. Having hands-on projects in science, math and engineering classes may also be highly unrealistic time-wise if they are independent projects. But if these classes assign group projects, then we have to consider the implications of the pass/D/fail option and the lower quality of work that frequently accompanies it. Students who want to take a class for a grade (or are required to for their major) might be placed in groups with students who are not taking the class for a grade. By imposing group dynamics on previously independent courses, students who are required to take a certain class might end up needing to pick up the slack of their group members if those members don’t take the class as seriously. An interactive, application-heavy science course would cause further stress for these students who are already tied down by huge chunks of required memorization. The distinction between classes and extracurricular activities also allows students a cushion grade-wise. Just think, if the application element of extracurricular activities were translated into classes and therefore a grade, students might be less willing to be imaginative and exploratory because they could be punished for trying something new if it doesn’t work out. Because of the fear of failing for taking a risk, students might not make as impressive of a product than if they were doing the same project for an extracurricular. Similarly, students might be discouraged from participating in extracurricular activities that are too similar to class projects that they failed. For example, a BSE student might be less willing to join Engineers Without Borders if a class he were taking in the engineering department had a project similar to those of the club and he failed it. Merging the instructive nature of classes with the application requirement of student organizations would curb the two-pronged college experience. Students would no longer feel as free to learn in the classroom setting or as free to experiment in the extracurricular activity setting. For students who are encouraged to think “out-of-the-box,” having relatively structured outlets for doing so may be exactly what is necessary to promote “free-thinking.”|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.  She can be reached at igomes@princeton.edu. 
49226|~|Is this the end for Butler?|~|   November 17 2013|~|Column | Nov. 17 |~|Anthony Grafton|~|None|~|Students who come to Princeton for graduate study buck a generational trend. Back in the ’70s and ’80s, when “Wolfen” and “Escape from New York” seemed like documentaries, Princeton was attractive. It offered calm and safety. But the world has moved on, and urban crime rates have plummeted. Nowadays, graduates of elite colleges and universities stream toward city lights like highly educated lemmings. Our graduate students — products of very similar institutions — make a counter-cultural choice when they decide to spend their 20s in central New Jersey. The sentiment sounds properly warm and fuzzy. But the policies behind it don’t. In fact, we plan to offer students places for their first three years on campus, with some possibility of a fourth. Go away to carry out your dissertation research — as many students do — or simply stay on while you’re working on the dissertation, often with less financial support, and Mother Princeton hands you an eviction notice. So much for community. The University authorities have their reasons, of course. They emphasize the difficulty of paying for the endless repairs needed to keep the Butler houses from collapsing into the Jersey mud they rest on. They note that the buildings are neither adapted for people with disabilities nor friendly to the environment. And they point out that in housing 70 percent of graduate students, they fulfill the University’s plans and match the performance of sister institutions. But the practical reasons for tearing Butler down don’t seem more urgent now than they have been for decades. The policy of housing 70 percent was framed long ago, at a time when Princeton was very different: a time when old houses were rented cheaply to students instead of being torn down to make way for McMansions — and when the cities weren’t equipped with warm beacons like the one at the end of Daisy’s pier. Saying that Princeton does as well as peer institutions is not an argument at all. Given our resources, we should be cleaning their clocks and forcing them to do better — as we did, so admirably, when it came to financial aid for undergraduates. If students have to pay high rents to live in Princeton — and the rents in the new buildings have to be high, to cover their costs — some will decide not to come at all. Others will come, but they will spend most or all of their Princeton years in New York or Philadelphia. And a good many more senior students will decide, understandably, that it makes more sense to pay an exorbitant rent in a city that boasts more than three bars and coffee shops, rather than a very high one in an apartment complex on a New Jersey road that doesn’t have sidewalks. Once again, so much for community.|~|

49215|~|Are "flipped" humanities courses viable?|~|   November 17 2013|~|Column | Nov. 17 |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|It may be time to open Pandora’s box. I am speaking, of course, about the feasibility of integrating mixed modes of learning into Princeton’s humanities courses. Last month, in an article addressing the disillusionment with massive open online courses, Bennett McIntosh ’16 argued that the most preferable educational model is one in which face-to-face interactivity prospers over the “mono-directional” trend of online educational services like Coursera. He says it is especially critical that the liberal arts encourage the personal encounters that characterize lecture halls. Whereas learning in the presence of professors and peers (see: precepts) allows one to appreciate the sense of community peculiar to a college campus, simply watching videos complicates one’s ability to acquire “critical thinking [skills and] a functional personal ethics system.” While I understand the valuation of conventional modes of learning, I would like to expand on (and slightly modify) this approach. I am more inclined to align my views with those proposed by Lauren Davis ’15 in her own column on MOOCs. Although Davis shares McIntosh’s sentiments about the irreplaceable function of the university campus, she acknowledges that Princeton will need to “borrow some of the innovations offered by the MOOC model” to maintain its status as a top-tier learning institution. One way the University might enhance its courses, she said, is by employing the “flipped” lecture model, which is popular among some of the nation’s leading schools. The flipped classroom is a form of blended teaching in which students watch lecture videos on their own and later apply theoretical concepts in group sessions. Last Friday, the ‘Prince’ featured a story by Elizabeth Paul ’15 on the mixed responses to the flipped format of COS 226: Data Structures and Algorithms, a class designed to revolve around an online instructional component. Although the flipped element was eventually made optional, Paul notes, “flipped lectures could provide students [with] the opportunity to more deeply explore course material.” Similarly, I believe the most ideally integrated online courses would supplement traditional learning methods instead of supplanting them. The question of humanities-related MOOCs persists, though. While it may be simpler to render mathematical and scientific concepts on a screen, complications seem to arise when we talk about subjects such as English, history and philosophy, whose longevity has been dependent upon dialogic exchange. In a study conducted at the University of British Columbia, a group of English professors and teaching assistants replaced biweekly lectures with online work, combining this with weekly discussion groups similar to precepts. Using a class website, the instructors, who were teaching a nonfiction prose class, offered their students various interpretations of class readings, observations on the essays’ argumentative structures and additional elements that would increase the students’ sense of instructional autonomy. The teachers would emphasize to their students that they were reading opinions of works, not definitive conclusions. In addition, student-guided discussion boards challenged these pupils to reconsider the meaning of academic authority and undermine the assumptions of objective truths. The students assumed the roles of creator and spectator, no longer exclusively bound by the walls of the lecture hall. Moreover, the mixed-mode class was optional. By opening avenues for student participation instead of closing them, these instructors created a class that balanced contemporary and classical pedagogies. Students responded well to the class, which was ultimately considered a success, and the professors accomplished their goal: to create a course that didn’t oppose conventional teaching, but established a framework in which to explore a new, diversified learning environment. Like my fellow columnists, I have reason to doubt that online courses will supersede professors. There is something admirable about the near-theatricality of lectures and the spontaneity of precept discussions. Instead of avoiding MOOCs because of their unfamiliarity, however, it may behoove academia to consider how they could be reconciled with traditionally accepted modes of teaching. The distinction between what can be accomplished online and in-person is often subtle. In the example cited above, the professors concluded that their class encouraged a pluralistic type of thinking by which students could interpret information in various ways: rapidly or gradually, privately or communally. I can imagine how the HUM sequence might be enhanced if an online component were made available. In a video, the six professors could debate about conflicting interpretations of a text. With the consultation of multimedia experts, subjects such as music, visual art and archaeology could be represented in ways not afforded by a lecture. The options are innumerable. The complexity of integration, however, should not be understated. Although I am receptive to the notion of hybrid humanities courses, the success of MOOCs is contingent upon student initiative and professorial innovation, among other considerations. Still, I do not believe that MOOCs will make face-to-face interactivity obsolete in the near future. Rather than shying away from unorthodox teaching methods, it may well be time for experimentation.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich. He can be reached at aaroncr@princeton.edu. 
49278|~|Editorial: Uncontested USG elections |~|   November 17 2013|~|Editorial | Nov. 17 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Updated 11:03 p.m. Nov. 17, 2013 Recently, the Undergraduate Student Government announced the candidates running in its upcoming 2013 elections. Several of these candidates, initially including those running for President and Vice President, are running in uncontested elections. Because of a special decision by the USG senate, however, this year’s presidential election will be contested. Uncontested elections are not a new problem for the USG. The Editorial Board believes that uncontested elections, especially those for the highest positions in the Student Government, limit the diversity of opinion in the USG and ultimately prevent accurate representation of the University community. We are thus encouraged by the fact that this year’s presidential election will be contested. In order to decrease the number of unopposed elections in future years, the Board suggests that the administration give the USG a more legitimate role in University decision making and that the USG change the way it reaches out to students. Uncontested elections could be the unfortunate consequence of the University’s relationship with their student government. It may be that the University has not given the USG enough power to make meaningful changes to the campus community. While the Student Government can suggest changes, the University reserves the right to ignore or even act against these recommendations. Further, the University’s lack of recognition of the USG’s efforts could additionally make a student government tenure a less rewarding experience than it could be, discouraging students from running for these positions. While it is impossible to tell if these factors are directly causing the uncontested elections, this much is clear: the University should be concerned that its students do not want be a part of its student government. One possible way to encourage more people to run is by reaching out to student leaders around campus. While emails sent out to the entire undergraduate student body are an effective way to cast a wide net, they are not likely to convince people to run. Contacting specific students because of their experience would have the effect of encouraging individuals to run who may have not considered it. Such students may not know that their experience would be a valuable addition to the USG and would thus not be willing to run unless specifically contacted. Further, the USG has several committees and positions that could be uniquely served by the input of students with leadership experience in a variety of student groups. The Board particularly hopes that the USG might reach out to leaders of student groups that are traditionally underrepresented in student government—student athletes being just one example of a group that may merit more targeted outreach. This is not to say that specific individuals on campus should be tapped for positions; rather, targeted outreach should be used encourage students to apply for committees or run for Senator or U-Councilor. This would give these students the experience needed to run for President or Vice President later on, thereby increasing the probability that elections are contested. Competitive elections serve as dialogues in which issues and solutions are openly discussed and thus serve to improve our Princeton experiences. Increasing and diversifying student involvement at the lower levels of the USG would not only make it more likely that fewer elections in the future are like this year’s, but would also make the organization more representative of the student body. The Board believes that uncontested elections are a major issue that both the University administration and the student government must work to address. Balancing the relationships between the University and its student government and targeting outreach efforts are simply proposals that may promote competitive elections. What is clear, though, is that the University administration, the USG, or both bodies, need to take steps in order to decrease the likelihood of future unopposed elections.|~|Editor’s note: A version of this editorial was published before the USG announced that Zach Ogle ’15 will in fact be allowed to run against incumbent Shawon Jackson ’15 for president. This article has been updated to reflect this fact.  
48943|~|The humanities debate|~|   November 14 2013|~|Column | Nov. 14 |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|There has been a trend in the past four decades of University students shying away from the humanities in favor of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The world is becoming increasingly technology-centric. Technical skills are therefore increasingly important, and more people should be interested in pursuing those skills — even in the social sciences, statistics has become absolutely required. Where did the rigorous and serious field of computer science come from? Departments such as math, statistics and physics. To have innovation, technical studies require the engagement of the academy. Technical skills can lead to a certain set of in-demand jobs. According to information provided by The Wall Street Journal based on census data, high-paying jobs, including those on Wall Street, go to students who graduate in economics and other technical fields. Economics itself has splintered in various forms — Princeton alone has economics, economics with a math bent, Operations Research and Financial Engineering, a certificate in “finance” (which is the number one certificate by popularity) and a Woodrow Wilson financial policy track. It makes sense that there would be a splintering and expansion of financial fields. The economy is growing, becoming more complicated, and there are more specific and specialized skills necessary to operate within that economy. The tools to deal with an increasingly complicated system should be increasingly focused. If students are gravitating toward certain fields, they are necessarily leaving other fields. At the same time that more people are going into finance, fewer are going into the humanities. I believe that this should be of concern, though it is not unexpected and not necessarily bad. It is possible, in the same breath, to bemoan loudly the decline of cultural literacy and understand the increase in utility-centric academic pursuits. One of the primary reasons to be concerned that fewer students are being educated in the humanities is that America seems to be slowly losing its ties to high culture. I am, however, not convinced that the decline in humanities majors is necessarily to blame. The beautiful tradition of Western scholarship is important, but the form of culture-consumption changes — there are trends over time. Aristotle wrote dialogues, but we don’t have all of them; they disappeared as things do when they are not intentionally preserved. It is somewhat fashionable to lament the death of the opera — more fashionable, in fact, than going to the opera. I personally appreciate the medium but understand that it is not particularly popular right now. Change is not inherently a normative bad. Works of enduring worth will endure. Homer’s “Odyssey” and the Bible still grace most high school curricula, as they should and as they might continue to do. It is hard for me to admit that I am not mourning the decrease of humanities majors. I take my rounded education here very seriously, though I am not upset that I do not have to take Greek, Latin and Biblical Hebrew, as I would have if I came here decades or centuries ago. That academic pursuit fizzled to make way for what I consider to be more valuable: our distribution requirements, freshman writing requirements, etc. Even engineering students at Princeton have to take classes in Epistemology and Cognition and Literature and the Arts. But if time changes the Princeton student’s consumption of information, so be it. Forms of this debate have appeared in many places, including The New York Times. Lamenting the requests he gets to donate his writing, author Tim Kreider wrote in his Oct. 26 column that: “My parents blew tens of thousands of 1980s dollars on tuition at a prestigious institution to train me for this job. They also put my sister the pulmonologist through medical school, and as far as I know nobody ever asks her to perform a quick lobectomy — doesn’t have to be anything fancy, maybe just in her spare time, whatever she can do would be great…” Point well taken; getting paid money is an important part of working, and the expectation that writers are not due the same respect is unfair. But there is a clear difference between Kreider and his sister. Both of them, I’m sure, are good at their respective jobs, but there is a certain element of technical expertise that separates him from his sister. Those who work in finance these days have a technical know-how that is new, growing and developing. The field is becoming more demanding and more specialized. Perhaps it makes sense that as the field expands and becomes more complicated, more students should pursue an understanding of it. That humanities are suffering is, of course, sad, but so the trends go: the more technical the world becomes, the more technicians are necessary. Culture and the Western scholarly tradition are perhaps changing, but surely not dying.|~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif. He can be reached at applbaum@princeton.edu. 
48937|~|Major mistakes|~|   November 14 2013|~|Column | Nov. 14 |~|Susannah Sharpless|~|None|~|I decided my major in literally a split second. I was sitting in a room in 1879 Hall waiting for precept to begin, when I realized— suddenly — I was content. I felt happy to be in this world, in this school, in this room, in this body, and in that moment, I decided I would study religion. It was a pretty big decision to let my gut make for me, but it wasn’t totally random: I had always been concerned with spirituality and morality and meaning, I just hadn’t yet articulated to myself that religion might be the best way for me to pursue those interests. If you had told me when I graduated high school that I would be a religion major, I would have laughed in your face. I took my first religion course because it was about film, and though religion sounded boring, film sounded cool. Plus, I needed an Ethical Thought and Moral Values class. My falling in love with the discipline came as a total surprise, and it always makes me smile to think that had I not been searching for a good EM, I never would have ended up in the religion department. This is partly why Princeton has these requirements — to encourage students to take things that seem boring or terrifying or alien to us. College, after all, is supposed to be the place where you find what you love and what you want to do. Your education is a journey, everyone says, neglecting to mention that the road becomes increasingly narrow as you get older. For A.B. students, it’s pretty much set in stone by junior fall. Engineers have it even harder: They choose a major freshman spring, and for both schools, it’s pretty hard to switch once you’re in a department. The Princeton website’s “Major Choices” page explains that such changes are rare, but “You may be comforted to know there are sometimes opportunities to change your mind.” Never has anything been less comforting. Because, guys, seriously, what if we screw up? What if you think you love art, but you really love math? What if you stumble into an anthropology class after declaring another major and realize you love anthro more than English? I recently stared at the classes offered by the Center for Human Values with a sour feeling in my stomach, wondering whether — instead of dismissing them because they sounded pretentious — I should have actually looked into taking one. The thing is, though, that during my freshman and even in the beginning of my sophomore year, I would have rolled my eyes at the idea of studying ethics. It is only because of the work I’ve done this far in religion that I’ve realized I care — a lot — about morality. Maybe I should have thought harder about all my opportunities and not dismissed a whole school of intellectual thought so easily. But, honestly, how could I have known where my education would lead or that the decisions I was making would take me somewhere I didn’t expect? How could anybody? College was once a place where I could do anything and be anyone, full of possibilities and promise, but the problem is that — if you’re doing college right — the whole spectrum of selves available to you necessarily has to get smaller as you go through it. You start out overwhelmed by your options, and everyone tells you to open every door you find, but come sophomore spring you walk through a door and find you can’t walk back through too easily. The volume of our independent work makes this choice especially heavy: Two years of immersing yourself in a subject can be awful if you’re not sufficiently fond of what you’re studying. Choosing what that will be feels huge, definite, absolute. But my suspicion is that this choice is actually liberating, not restricting. I’m inclined to believe that the name “Princeton” on a diploma overshadows everything else. The exact discipline we major in means less, I think, than what we’ve learned, and our independent work actually offers us an opportunity to get interdisciplinary, to bend the rules. Even if I never do anything with religion for as long as I live, at least I’ve learned that I care a lot about a just society and ethical systems, and because of this, I have a better idea about the kind of life I’d like to live. Although sometimes when I think about all the things I could have done and could still be doing, I start to freak out a little, college doesn’t mean the end of our educations. It just means the end of college.|~|Susannah Sharpless is a religion major from Indianapolis, Ind. She can be reached at ssharple@princeton.edu.   
48933|~|Editorial: Implementing a data analysis requirement|~|   November 14 2013|~|Editorial | Nov. 14 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Princeton’s website explains that distribution requirements “transcend the boundaries of specialization and provide all students with a common language and common skills.”  Currently, the University requires A.B. students to complete classes in seven general areas: Social Analysis, Epistemology and Cognition, Ethical Thought and Moral Values, Historical Analysis, Literature and the Arts, Quantitative Reasoning and Science and Technology.  Providing a holistic education is the core of Princeton’s mission, and these requirements are a commendable measure toward that end. But Princeton’s formula for liberal education must at times adapt to the world beyond the FitzRandolph Gate.  Those students who graduate Princeton with no exposure to computer programming or to basic data analysis leave this school without skills that are fundamental to the world in which we live. Accordingly, the Board urges the University to replace the STN requirement with a data analysis and computer programming requirement. Our personal, professional and civic lives are conducted, shaped, monitored and informed by computers and by the data they collect. The recent enrollment explosion in 100- and 200-level computer science classes to some extent reflects student awareness of this fact. This upward trend has stretched the department’s resources thin. The University tried to curb enrollment by designating the most popular courses “No Pass/D/Fail.”  This increase is not a fad, just as the Internet, computing and “Big Data” are not fleeting trends. Instead of fighting student interest, the administration should reexamine and update its understanding of a liberal education. A computer science/data analysis requirement could be fulfilled by programming or statistics courses. Currently, some statistics classes and most 100-, 200- and 300-level COS classes are designated as fulfilling the Quantitative Reasoning requirement. But this requirement can also be filled by traditional math classes such as calculus that have little to do with programming or statistics, leaving many A.B. students with an inadequate understanding of recent technological developments. The marginal value of the STN requirement in addition to the STL is minimal when compared to the potential value of a data analysis and computer programming requirement. Recognizing that expanding distribution requirements may impinge upon students’ other academic endeavors, the Board thus believes that the STN should be dropped in order to accommodate the proposed requirement. Computer programming and data analysis would confer skills that are intellectually important and professionally helpful in a wide range of fields. It is no coincidence that a number of humanities departments already require majors to fulfill some kind of a statistics requirement. COS 126: General Computer Science is already a requirement for all B.S.E. students. But computer science and data analysis courses offer more than just technical skills for students pursuing quantitative degrees; they provide an introduction to a system of thinking and problem-solving without which a modern liberal arts education is incomplete. Even for students who want to pursue careers in fields that are not dependent on computer programming or big data, understanding these concepts is important because they have significantly influenced the broader workings of society. As such, the Board recommends that the University adopt a computer programming and data analysis requirement in order to prepare students for their professional careers and to maintain the comprehensiveness of its educational curriculum.|~|

48781|~|Pursuing our passions|~|   November 13 2013|~|Column | Nov. 13 |~|Prianka Misra|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|As I write these articles, I often wonder if this is what I could do for a living. When I wrote for my high school newspaper, I did not muse with such audacity. “Expos” — short for “expository writing,” my newspaper class — was just an elective. There was no way I was going to marry my career to this one seemingly tangential interest; there was no possibility of making a living off the mundane headlines that tried to spice up the humdrum happenings of a small private school. I had done some writing for the local paper as well, but it didn’t strike me that journalism could be a long-term passion, rather than a transient one. But when I came to Princeton, something pushed me to keep writing. Something that had seemed like a luxury before — writing for a college newspaper and being able to essentially talk to the entire student population at once — became a reality. As I see the paths of Princeton alumni that now have the opportunity to write for major news sources, I understand that I could possibly expand this dream and apply it to real life. Many of them started out like me, writing for college publications. My story is not a needle in a haystack: There are plenty of pre-professional extracurricular activities on campus that could possibly translate to jobs outside the Orange Bubble. Being on the debate team could introduce you to policy-making or law, while being involved in the social entrepreneurship club could lead you to start-up ideas that you pursue after college. And often, these pre-professional activities — rather than our classes or our GPAs — bring us the essential skills that we can describe and cite during interviews. We often learn most from the leadership and logistical tasks we face outside of the classroom. So, this leads me to a question: If we learn so much from these pre-professional extracurriculars, and they have such an impact on our job searches, what are we even doing in class in the first place? This may seem like a radical question, and I’m not proposing that we abandon the idea of a structured academic system at all. But I do think that we should reform the way we view the purpose of class. As it stands, classes in the social sciences at Princeton are usually seen as separate from pre-professional extracurriculars. While classes in the English department can be highly theoretical and engineering classes are highly hands-on, the social sciences represent an interesting middle ground between theory and application. However, as a student in this field, I find that my classes err more on the theoretical end, even though I wish they included more concepts that show me how to apply these theories. In my opinion, all classes should adopt a more applied philosophy and utilize an involved approach to assignments and activities, teaching students the problem-solving strategies that are reflected in the real world. This way, extracurriculars could serve as testing grounds for the concepts we learned in class. Professor John Danner teaches one such class that goes above and beyond my expectations, called “Special Topics in Social Entrepreneurship: Ventures to Address Global Challenges.” We constantly interact with guest lecturers who have turned social ventures that combat global health issues into tangible products and business models, and we are required to make videos, posters and pitches about our own venture ideas. These are all valuable skills that I could see people using when they are promoting a club, but not in other lecture-based classes. Danner’s class exceeds my expectations of a liberal arts education and even ventures into a pre-professional realm of academics. While I enjoy this, I think it would simply suffice to expose students to the concepts, not necessarily to the applications. Learning about how to build an entrepreneurial team, how to make a scalable venture and how to understand the concept of economic sustainability are all examples of what I want my classes to give me. We could learn a lot more if our classes challenged us to fuel our passions, think creatively and contextualize our skills in the way that many pre-professional extracurriculars do. While I might not become a social entrepreneur, I can say that Danner’s class has already given me ideas, a knowledge base and skills I can use in the rest of my life, let alone at interviews. If all of our classes could teach us how to actively pursue our passions — be that in terms of policy, society or economy — in practical ways, maybe we could get one step closer to actually doing it.|~|Prianka Misra is a sophomore from Castro Valley, Calif.

48786|~|Getting lost in (and around) the arts|~|   November 13 2013|~|Column | Nov. 13 |~|Ye Eun Charlotte Chun|~|None|~|It had already been a particularly grating night when I trudged my way to the Wa. I had already set off the fire alarm (twice) burning popcorn in Witherspoon, and the U-Store employees had shut the doors on me as I wildly gesticulated toward my phone, which read 3:59 a.m. Just when I thought my luck couldn’t get any worse, I realized I had looped around the Wa four times and was trapped in the metal maze that was the Arts and Transit project. Despite its very prominent construction and a $300 million donation made in its honor, the Arts and Transit project has gotten very little reaction beyond annoyance. Very few seem to know the objective of the project, nor do they seem to care; all they know is that journeying to Forbes is now a daily Triwizard task. However, behind this indifference lies a significant turning point in how Princeton has come to perceive and interact with the arts on campus. With the exception of the Art Museum, the University has always been more of a sponsor for cultural events off-campus than an active patron for bringing the arts near home. The scramble for “Lion King” tickets may be more vicious than my grandmother haggling at night market, yet the objectives of the Arts and Transit project are hardly ever discussed. The University can’t bring the “arts” back to liberal arts without better engaging the students in the process. Part of the issue is how we perceive the arts. Generally, the arts are what we’d all love to be a part of but don’t have the time for. They’re always referred to in the context of “arts and leisure” or “arts and recreation”; art is never seen as a fundamental reflection of our lives with broader implications. It’s a means of rewarding ourselves when we have the time, a stage of self-actualization that can only be achieved after we fulfill our most basic needs of finishing a problem set or even grabbing late meal. This is a mindset that originates predominantly in and is reflected by how we study the arts at Princeton. While majors and certificates allow those specializing in the arts to more easily explore options and branch out into various academic fields, the majority of us find it difficult to dip our feet in. Introductory courses, while approachable, hardly offer more than a perfunctory glimpse into the arts and offer little incentive for beginner students to stay. For the few brave souls who do, they are confronted by a huge leap in technical knowledge that often bars them from doing well in the class. While this is a phenomenon not unique to the arts, it’s particularly exacerbated by the lack of interdisciplinary arts studies here at Princeton. Interdisciplinary classes could not only make the arts more approachable and interesting to a general populace but could also prevent the marginalization of the arts as an elusive and “untouchable” field. For example, NYU’s Tisch School offers a major in arts and public policy, taking a look at how art emerging from a genocide impacts a nation’s democratic transition, or how the patronage of Renaissance art influenced modern-day Italy’s economy. MIT offers courses analyzing the role of technology in the music industry and how mathematics influences the beats of pop music. The possibilities are infinite, yet few are explored here at Princeton. Inconvenient as its construction may be, the Arts and Transit project wasn’t initiated to improve the quality of education for only those concentrating in the arts; it was to enhance interest and engagement among those far removed from the field. It’s one thing to go watch “Carmen” at the Met but another to see the implications of the Met in New York City’s economy. It’s one thing to visit Princeton’s Art Museum but another to understand how visiting students from schools in Trenton use art to fundraise for better classrooms. This year could be a turning point for what we do with the arts. We can choose to ignore the issue, or we can begin exploring a fundamental aspect of academia and cultural life strangely missing from Princeton’s environment. For a school that pushes so hard for liberal arts, it seems to be missing the most critical piece of the puzzle, and it’s time we do something about this.|~|Ye Eun Charlotte Chun is a sophomore from Seoul, South Korea.

48777|~|Princeton's newest title|~|   November 13 2013|~|Column | Nov. 13 |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Princeton recently obtained another trophy to place right next to its rank as the No. 1 college in the country: top honors in Trojan’s 2013 Sexual Health Report Card. Trojan evaluated the student health centers of 140 colleges and universities across the country in 11 categories: hours of operation, availability of contraception, STD testing, HIV testing, availability of condoms, ease of student scheduling, quality of resources and information online, sexual education outreach programs, sexual assault programs, website usability and “extra credit.” Between our SHARE counselors, Sexual Health Advisors, hallway envelopes of contraceptives, the ease of scheduling a next-day appointment at McCosh Health Center and the LGBT Center in Frist, it’s definitely true that Princeton’s doing pretty well in the sexual health department. What does surprise me, however, is that Princeton beat out the likes of Brown and Columbia. I think that the student body as a whole was a little surprised when we saw that Princeton took top honors. Maybe it’s the severe, ivy-laced gothic buildings and pastel button-ups as far as the eye can see, but there’s something about Princeton that seems to scream a reluctance to talk about sex openly. Despite this, Trojan seems to think we have a good system set up already. However, I think it’s important to realize that there’s still more that can be done. The reason I compare Princeton to Columbia and Brown is that I think they have a lot in the category of “extra credit” that we simply don’t. Take Sex Week, for example: Almost every other Ivy has one, while we don’t. It takes different forms: at Yale, the approach is multidisciplinary. Coordinators invite a range of people — company executives, sex therapists, professors, clergy, adult film stars — to give talks throughout a week-long event that is held once every two years. Harvard had its first Sex Week last year, offering workshops and talks on everything from gender identity to sexuality in the context of faith. Princeton’s club Let’s Talk Sex has been hoping to put together a Sex Week here at the school for quite a few years now, but nothing has come to fruition yet. What a Sex Week would allow for is a decreased taboo on speaking openly and freely about the subject. It would also allow for all sorts of opinions to be voiced. Even those in support of abstinence and abstinence education could hold lectures, though one wouldn’t automatically associate conservative viewpoints with such a liberal-sounding event. Though it would arguably be difficult to quantify, I also think the candidness of sex speech should be a factor Trojan takes into account on its next report card. That, above any of the other factors, is indicative of the general mood of a campus with regard to sexual health and sex education. Other forms of “extra credit” could come in the form of a sex column, like Columbia’s Go Ask Alice! While we do have the Sexpert, a column published weekly by the ‘Prince’ that answers a specific submitted question, it’s not nearly as user-friendly or helpful as Columbia’s version. This is mainly because Columbia’s sex column is an extensive website with searchable, sortable archives and an easy way to submit anonymous questions. The website spans topics from general health to specifically sexual questions, and it has questions dating back to 1993. The submitted questions are answered by health care professionals as well. We’re certainly on the right track by having a sex column at all, but its format and usability could be made better. Princeton is doing well in the sexual health and education department — well enough to win top honors in Trojan’s annual survey. However, we can still do better. The main problem at Princeton is a sense of taboo surrounding open talk about sex. This could be alleviated in part by a Sex Week, which would increase dialogue about the topic and create an open forum in which all types of views could be aired. We should also expand our sex column to give students a more convenient resource for embarrassing questions that can be moderated anonymously. In true Princeton fashion, we got the A, but we should be looking for the A+.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J. She can be reached at shruthid@princeton.edu. 
48607|~|Time to think|~|   November 12 2013|~|Column | Nov. 12 |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|Before I came to Princeton, I thought of college as it was portrayed in the movies. Perhaps naively, movies like “A Beautiful Mind” or “Mona Lisa Smile” came to mind. Some students would lie around chewing pencils and discussing current events; others would be arguing over brainteasers the professor introduced as an extra challenge on a whiteboard in their common rooms. Students could just gather together and think in an unstructured way, learning through self-initiated discourse. Granted, I knew Princeton wouldn’t be about highbrow intellectual discussion all the time, but I thought there would be more time to just sit around and think. When freshman year came around, all those preconceptions went out the window. Between four to five classes a semester, extracurriculars, room-cleaning and dinner-eating, there was little opportunity for anyone to engage in intellectual discussion. Little bits of free time with friends were for small talk and joking around; there weren’t usually large enough blocks of time for friendly conversations to turn into deep-thinking discussions. A lot of precepts involved academic conversation, but only in a structured way that adhered strictly to the class syllabus, rather than letting the conversation organically reach different topics. In a sociology class, for instance, we only discussed the book or the topic the preceptor assigned, not connections drawn from other sources. The preceptor usually guided the conversation in a way that would “help” students realize a predetermined principle, probably one that was discussed in lecture, by the end of the precept. Math and science precepts were, from my experience, mostly about homework problems or examples that were similar, so those classes were similarly formulaic in terms of content. By the end of freshman year, I figured that perhaps there wasn’t need for intellectual discourse if I was already spending so much time learning through class time. I had learned exactly what was in the syllabus, as promised. I didn’t realize what I had been missing until I led my first Outdoor Action trip in September of this year. My group of randomly selected eight freshmen taught me more through trail discussions than some of my classes did. With several free hours every day just to talk, we ended up devoting a morning to metaphors in “The Stranger” by Camus and its relation to “Waiting for Godot,” we discussed the nature of infinity and the proof of how all rational numbers made up a countable set, and we evaluated the rise in popularity of electronic music. We came up with an idea for a murder-mystery novel inspired by a dangerous-looking hiker we encountered on the trail, using dramatic devices like Chekhov’s gun and red herrings. It stretched the bounds of my knowledge just to keep up with them and contribute. With enough free time, like my group had on OA, I think any randomly assembled group of people could find a way to learn outside of the bounds of a curriculum through discussion with one another. It just takes an uninterrupted block of time and a group of smart, curious people. The problem is that we simply don’t have the time. Deluged by papers to write about the books we’ve read, we don’t have time to connect them to other books or discuss an alternate ending the author had considered or the story behind how the author came up with the characters. With weekly computer programming assignments, complete with APIs and formats we have to follow exactly, we don’t have time to come up with anything on our own. They come predictably, week after week after week, with no downtime. Everything is precisely structured. We are, to some extent, fed what we are meant to know. Since OA, I’ve never had another discussion quite as mind-bending as the ones I had on my trip, and I certainly feel like something is missing. Sitting around and thinking with classmates and friends is just as important a part of education as sitting in class and listening to a professor is. Unstructured discussion is about coping with uncertainty. We don’t know what the answer is off the bat, so we have to argue and make a decision, just like in real life. There’s no grader to say who’s right or who’s wrong in a boardroom meeting. This type of conversation is about learning to think outside the confines of what a textbook or academic authority has to say. It’s true that learning the fundamentals in class is important, and it can be easiest to learn those fundamentals in a methodical way. But unstructured intellectual discussion still should have a bigger place on campus than it does now. Whether that means cutting down on assignments or holding these kinds of discussions in precepts, we just need some time to think.|~|Barbara Zhan is a sophomore from Plainsboro, N.J.

48553|~|The real economics of choosing a major|~|   November 12 2013|~|Column | Nov. 12 |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Whenever today’s college students tell people back home (especially of older generations) about what they’re majoring in, the inevitable response (either direct or implied by snide facial expressions) is usually either “good for you; that’ll really put you on the fast track” or “what are you going to do with that after you graduate?” For most people whose major is not an obvious moneymaker, a common justification (though certainly not the only one) is moral or philosophical, something along the lines of “life’s too short” or “I’d always regret it.” I think a better justification can be found in economics. Before the mid-20th century, conventional economic wisdom said that most people behave as “wealth-maximizers” and, given a choice, would choose the path that gave them the most expected money. But in 1944, two economists, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, said that people behave instead as “utility-maximizers” and will, in many cases, sacrifice wealth (present or potential) for other things that make them happier. Modern economists have since found exceptions to this rule, where rational actors do things that don’t maximize their utility. But even so, post-WWII economics tells us that if people behave as “utility-maximizers” instead of “wealth-maximizers” — which, in the case of choosing a college major, I believe most people do — then they will choose the major and subsequent career that they believe will make them “happiest,” whatever that personally means to them. In picking a college major, most millennials seem to have adopted the von Neumann-Morgenstern model of economic value, whereas most of their parents and grandparents have retained the older, finance-based definition. Both are justifiable, as some level of financial success is an important and necessary consideration for everyone, but I believe that, in this case, happiness-maximization should be prioritized beyond that arbitrarily defined level. We should encourage people to choose their majors based on the newer model, instead of forcing an antiquated definition of “success” onto everyone facing this life decision. People fundamentally value different things. If you value money the most, which is totally understandable and does not need to be apologized for, then pursuing a career based on its expected financial return is logical and proper for you. But many of us place a higher value on other things. Anyone who has taken high-school English classes has been conditioned to value intellectual satisfaction, moral success or familial happiness. I don’t disagree that these are worthy aims; I simply believe that there are others that are equally noble, or at least equally rational. As someone who is considering politics as a career, it could be said that I most value power, influence, advancing my moral goals, advocating for others or a variety of more cynical things. Different people have different goals and want different things, and money doesn’t have to be the top priority for everyone. This system is self-correcting as well: Everyone’s utility at some level depends upon money, and as their wealth approaches zero, they prioritize it more. This means that most people, if they take the financial “risk” of pursuing a so-called “impractical” major and despite attaining their own definition of success are completely poor, will “self-correct” out of necessity and try to make more money. At some self-determined level of being “backed into a corner” financially, everyone will, out of sheer necessity, do something to bring themselves more income, even if that means sacrificing some level of happiness in other areas. I don’t necessarily mean a complete career change; take, for example, a politics major. If he repeatedly runs for elected office — say, on a local level — and never wins, he may well decide to look for work in marketing or political consulting, even if that’s not exactly what he wants to be doing. Given enough negative incentive, people may not change what qualifications they have, but they probably will change what they do with them. I don’t think that most people have such stubborn drives that they’d rather be completely indigent than compromise their goals even one bit. I understand that it is not a perfect world, and many people can’t simply make a job change whenever they want. But given the educational opportunities we’ve been fortunate enough to receive, a change is usually possible in some way or another. Realistically speaking, most people will not graduate from Princeton into permanent abject poverty. What all of this means is that parents sending their children to Princeton should probably stop worrying — or at least worry less — about their son’s or daughter’s financial success afterward. Everyone can define success in their own way, and who are we to stop them from or judge them for pursuing it, especially provided a “safety net” of self-correction? If success to you is money, go for it. If it’s influence, charity, artistic exploration or intellectual achievement, go for it. Act in your own self-interest, but, at the very least, allow yourself to define what that self-interest is.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

48558|~|On your mark|~|   November 12 2013|~|Column | Nov. 12 |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|I had a rough start one morning, so I decided to catch the bus from Whitman to Clio Hall to make it to my opening shift at Marquand Library. As soon as I stepped off the bus, I started to walk rather briskly toward the library when an older woman came up alongside of me and said to me, “Isn’t it beautiful?” I was rather confused, but then the older woman stopped and turned toward Dillon Gymnasium and Edwards Hall. I followed her lead, and my eyes widened when I saw a lush green tree. It was standing on its own, and in the background there were several trees with yellow leaves. The woman told me that this was a ginkgo tree and that she takes time every morning to look at that particular tree, even if she has to hurry to work. As many times as I have walked or taken the bus up campus this fall, I have never once stopped and looked at this tree. I admitted this to the woman. My only justification — if one could call it that — is that I’ve always been in a hurry. She flashed a warm smile and told me that it doesn’t take too long to look. She told me to just count: “On your mark …” Then she giggled. She meant that, since I seemed so busy, I should set a mental timer and look quickly. Afterward, we wished each other a good day and parted ways. I don’t know if I will ever run into that woman again, but she made me wonder about my inattention to the beauty that is Princeton’s campus. Perhaps I need to take a moment to reflect, whether it is by gazing at a tree or by making brief contact with someone else. I, as well as many others, create a private space even while walking around campus. We wear headphones large enough to block out the loudest of noises. We do this not only to listen to our favorite tunes but, perhaps, also to stimulate our internal gears in order to keep walking quickly to our destination. I, for one, generally wear earphones every time I walk out of my dorm. But there have been many times when I miss someone saying hello to me and need to ask that person to repeat him- or herself so that I can pause the song that’s playing. Now I’m starting to wonder if I do this in order to send a signal to others to not talk to me at all. “I’m in the zone,” so to speak, or, “I need to get to my destination, and I need to remain focused.” Coincidentally, the day I met that woman who had a special affinity for Princeton’s trees, one of my earphones was not working so I could not listen to music. I believe that if I were listening to music, she probably would never have approached me or imparted her knowledge about taking it easy and enjoying what’s all around us. I’ve noticed that my Facebook friends are uploading Instagram pictures of magnificent trees all over campus. Although I’ve been in the locations where those photos were taken plenty of times, I cannot deny the sense of foreignness that I get whenever I look at them. I ask myself, “Why haven’t I seen those trees before?” Fall tends to be a brief season, and I haven’t been taking advantage of it, nature-wise. My faulty excuse is that I have been in a hurry, I walk really quickly and I wear earphones to block out stimuli. But, in fact, those stimuli are what enliven my surroundings. It makes me realize that I am here traversing these footpaths like other students, employees and faculty members. I’ve been missing out on a sense of community. And just think that it took one person to remind of my negligence in participating in the community around me. Ever since that one encounter, I haven’t worn my earphones around campus as I walk from point A to point B. Now it feels like I am experiencing the campus with a clearer perspective. I can hear the sounds of squirrels rustling in the bushes, people on skateboards, conversations from afar, birds chirping and the wind. All of these amenities were so easy to attain, and it seems laughable that it took me this long to really be mindful of them. Before I met that woman, “on your mark, get set … go” meant hurry up and get to class. Now, that phrase takes on a whole new meaning: Hurry up and experience the environment around you. Let it absorb you. You’re not running a race alongside anyone else, and there is no finish line. Just go … and have a look.|~|Morgan Jerkins is a comparative literature major from Williamstown, N.J.

48214|~|No place for stereotypes|~|   November 11 2013|~|Column | Nov. 11 |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|For anyone who is a fan of the dying art that is late-night comedy, you might be aware of “Saturday Night Live” member Kenan Thompson’s slightly controversial interview in which he explains why he thinks the show has yet to cast a black female. In a few words, Thompson said that the ones who audition simply “aren’t ready.” Despite this, this past weekend, Kerry Washington — accomplished black actress and star of the show that rules my Thursday nights, “Scandal” — hosted. For me, the funniest moment of the night was the digital short of Washington and Jay Pharaoh in a parody of the viral video, “What Does the Fox Say?” The premise of the video is simple and well-known: Washington plays the overly jealous, aggressive girlfriend who accuses her boyfriend of cheating. More than the funniest moment of the night, though, I found this to be the most annoying, too. Because while writers managed to fit Washington into almost every stereotype society has of black women — an unwavering Obama fan, even changing her into Beyonce and Oprah in the same skit to mock the fact that no other cast member could — this close-minded depiction is the most frustrating and the one I feel affects me the most. I can admittedly say that I’m fairly sassy, assertive when need be and ultimately, I make no apologies for having the thoughts and values that I do. These characteristics probably apply to a substantial number of people on campus, but I don’t think many feel their personalities are either pigeonholed or challenged due to longstanding societal stereotypes of them. This is the plight of the black woman. It’s really hard to win. I state a view passionately, and a friend may try to comically brush it off by doing a little neck roll. I’m annoyed and a little disappointed, but I let the moment pass. Later on, I may be quieter and reserved — because people are multifaceted, go figure — and someone will wonder where the sassy black woman went. I won’t say this is an everyday commonality, but it has happened often enough to make me unwillingly less outspoken or ridiculously cautious of what I’m saying to others to prove especially that I do not always fit the stereotype. While this dangerous pattern of polarizing stereotyping can affect people of all ages, I find that it is particularly dangerous in college, as these four years are so pivotal in determining who we are and wish to be as people. Having others thrust on you a prescribed idea of who you are is completely detrimental in this search. And do not think you’re safe if you are not a black woman. Stereotypes are so pervasive within our lives that at times they can go unnoticed. Last year, a friend commented on the fact that, to her surprise, athletes filled the first row or so of her CHM 201: General Chemistry I lecture. In the moment, we laughed. But almost immediately after, we realized how horrible it was that she was surprised in the first place, as if athletes cannot be both physically and academically hard-working. If they allowed others to pigeonhole them in this way, perhaps they would not even bother studying or attending lecture and become self-fulfilling prophecies. My own friend of Asian descent often feels pressure to do well, simply because of her background. And while the stereotype of overachieving seems superficially great, it can have harmful effects: One could take on a large course load that is completely impractical or avoid challenging courses so as to maintain the image of complete academic control. None of this is to say that stereotypes hold zero truth. They must, of course, have origins. As black women have historically been a marginalized social group, outspokenness has been a necessity for them to demand their rights. With both challenging schoolwork and practice schedules, athletes must sometimes sacrifice a bit of one for the other. And many parents of Eastern descent instill in their children the drive to succeed, as it was their own sense of ambition that led them to prosper. But these truths can never hold true for all of those who are stereotyped, and moreover, to determine the actions and behaviors of an entire group is simply a reflection of our laziness to acquaint ourselves with the many faces of both a person and the groups with which he or she identifies. We are in the Orange Bubble. Typically, this is seen negatively as a source of ignorance of the outside world. But it also gives us the unique opportunity to step out of the roles society has so adamantly tried to create for us — whether it is the stereotyper or the stereotyped — and make our own. Do not waste the chance to break this mold, or in wasting your chance and choosing to acquiesce, force someone else into the same fate.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La.

48344|~|Selling Princeton|~|   November 11 2013|~|Column | Nov. 11 |~|Daniel Xu|~|None|~|I recently had the pleasure of attending a small dinner lecture delivered by W. Barksdale Maynard ’88 on the topic of Princeton’s architectural history, from which I gleaned many a delightful tidbit of information about this place that we students from all four corners of the earth have come to call home. As I sat through slide after slide of photographs from the historical record, thoroughly engrossed by the evolution of our campus from a rural pasture surrounding lonely Nassau Hall to a vibrant mecca of global scholarship and aspirational tourism, I came to a startling realization: Princeton is not a small campus anymore. It may have been, once upon a time, many buildings and expansions ago, when the Dinky still dropped students off beneath the majesty of Blair Arch and not on a plywood platform in a parking lot. Anyone who has ever had to make the trek from Frick to Foulke or from Forbes to just about anywhere already knows that scuttling from place to place often requires much more time than the 10 minutes the Registrar optimistically allots at the end of each class period. Though I, on my brakeless bicycle, have seen the vast expanse of this sprawling campus hurtle by me, I was surprised to discover that somehow I had still managed to internalize the fantasy — oft-repeated in the pages of admission brochures and through the lips of Orange Key tour guides — that Princeton is some sort of intimate, intellectual country club sprung straight from the pages of an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. What’s more, I realized that I myself have been guilty of describing Princeton in this way to those outside our Orange Bubble. Perhaps this was inevitable. The first time I ever stepped foot on the Princeton campus was during my prefrosh visit, when the cheerful residential college adviser of my Preview hosts led me and a group of my fellow prospective students to the aptly-named Prospect Garden. As we admired the flowers and foliage in their soft April bloom, the RCA gestured to the Italianate villa overlooking the cobbled walkway on which we stood. “That’s Prospect House,” she said. “It’s a little like a restaurant. You’ll only get to eat there on special occasions, like if a professor invites you or something. I’ve only gotten to eat there once, and it was the best meal I’ve ever had on campus.” Two weeks ago, I received my first invitation to dine at Prospect House, at a luncheon with the journalist Janet Malcolm. I eagerly sent in my RSVP and reveled in my anticipation of what would undoubtedly be an incredible experience. On the day of the lunch, I returned from my 8:30 a.m. lecture and took a nap — the first I’d taken all year — awakening with a start to realize that I’d slept through my alarm and was already 20 minutes late. I rushed madly up to Prospect House and slunk, breathless and chagrined, into the only empty seat at the long white table in the ornate upper-story dining room. I sat, hungry and humiliated, at the best meal I would ever have on campus, too embarrassed to even rise and fill my empty plate. Each year during Preview Weekend, when the prefrosh tire of asking unsolicited questions of professors in seminars and take to grilling the undergraduates after class instead, I find myself saying some truly peculiar things. It starts innocuously, with something like “Princeton is a small campus,” and before I know it, I find myself telling well-worn half-truths designed to obstruct any comprehensive understanding of what life is really like on this side of paradise. “I don’t really worry about this grade deflation business.” “Everyone is more or less happy with their rooming situation, in the end.” “You’ll end up largely where you’re meant to be, eating club-wise.” I wonder if my habit of disingenuously sugarcoating Princeton’s flaws arises from my own insecurities about the choice I made to attend this University. I sometimes find myself feeling as though successfully recruiting a prospective student would somehow validate my own decision to matriculate four years ago. In this way, Princeton strikes me as an elaborate pyramid scheme, each new class trying desperately to convince its successors that this is a worthwhile place to be — and no successful pyramid scheme makes a point of full disclosure. I wonder how many others are deeply unsatisfied with some aspects of life at Princeton but still smile through their teeth while they sing the praises of Old Nassau. I suspect it is quite a few. Some time ago, a prospective freshman somehow acquainted with my brother wrote to me on Facebook asking for advice on her choice between Princeton and Harvard. I wrote her the best reply I could — lengthy, reckless and honest — the kind of language that would immediately disqualify a person from employment at a used-car dealership. I checked up on her a few weeks later to discover she’d chosen Harvard, with its own set of foibles and final clubs. Whatever her reasons for choosing, I hope she made the right decision in the end.|~|Daniel Xu is a molecular biology major from Knoxville, Tenn. He can be reached at dcxu@princeton.edu.  
48298|~|Lending our support|~|   November 11 2013|~|Column | Nov. 11 |~|Spencer Shen|~|None|~|Last week, The Daily Princetonian published a news article about a petition circulated by graduate students that opposed the demolition of the Butler Apartments. The students worry that the demolition will leave a large number of them without on-campus housing. The petition cited concerns over the administration’s target of housing 70 percent of its graduate students on-campus — a higher proportion than that of most of Princeton’s peer schools — as still too low in a wealthy suburban town where housing prices are far too high for graduate students to afford. Moreover, priority in assigning housing is given to newer graduate students, so the 70 percent figure is not evenly distributed across all years — from their third year onward, housing for graduate students is nowhere near guaranteed. The students are also concerned that they will be forced to live far from campus in order to find affordable housing, even as they continue to serve as preceptors and instructors for undergraduate courses. Although the University maintains that the local rent market will allow graduate students to find relatively affordable and conveniently located housing, Princeton’s wealthy suburban neighborhoods seem to suggest otherwise. Although it will be more than just a mild inconvenience to the graduate students involved, the demolition is not nearly as noticeable or as expensive as the other renovations occurring on campus, such as the extensive construction in Firestone Library or the new Lewis Center for the Arts. The demolition of the Butler Apartments and the rest of the administration’s Housing Master Plan won’t receive nearly as much of an emotional response from undergraduates or the local community as the demolition of the Old Dinky station and the construction of the Arts and Transit neighborhood. For most undergraduates, there is little contact with graduate students outside of precepts and office hours and perhaps those juggernaut intramural teams. However, they are still an essential part of Princeton — after all, we are not a strictly undergraduate-only liberal arts college like Williams College or Amherst College. They help conduct the research that keeps Princeton relevant in academia. The professor might be the one standing behind the podium and gesturing at the blackboard, but the graduate students are the ones who grade our homework and exams. They hold review sessions and office hours and answer our questions long after our professors have gone home. The petition against the demolition gathered over 200 signatures from graduate students — nearly 10 percent of Princeton’s graduate student body. If 10 percent of the undergraduate student body were to sign a petition, Nassau Hall would almost certainly take notice. The graduate student body seems to receive much less attention from the administration, and even less attention from the undergraduates, even as they constitute one of the key cogs that make Princeton run. Whether or not the administration is actually less attentive toward graduate students’ wants and needs is difficult to measure objectively. However, many of the older graduate students I spoke to, who are no longer given priority housing or Graduate College rooms, feel that the general atmosphere is one of administrative apathy. Princeton emphasizes its undergraduate education but that should not happen at the expense of its graduate schools. This is not to say that we should model ourselves after Harvard and Yale and create a medical school or a law school. Princeton shouldn’t risk becoming more known for its graduate schools than its undergraduate education, but the University could surely do more to ensure that its graduate students don’t end up with the short end of the stick. We undergraduates are coddled with a constant influx of study breaks, free T-shirts, therapy puppies and many other benefits — some of them are trivial and some of them are truly helpful, but all of them are symbolic of an administration that takes its “focus on undergraduate education” mantra a little too far. Many of us complain about the long walk from our residential colleges to Frick Chemistry Laboratory or the Engineering Quadrangle — especially those who live in Forbes College — but at least we don’t have to make that walk from the Graduate College or the Lawrence apartments. Even when the University enacts a policy that ends up being unpopular among the undergraduate student body, we can rest assured that the administration will keep its ears open to our input. Hopefully, the University will consider the forthcoming petition against the apartments’ demolition. The graduate students deserve the same respect and treatment that we enjoy. The undergraduate student body should consider lending its support to the graduate students on these sorts of occasions or at least take notice of issues that they face. Even if their problems don’t affect us, it is our responsibility to look out for each other as fellow Princetonians.|~|Spencer Shen is a sophomore from Austin, Texas.

48100|~|The stigma of competition |~|   November 10 2013|~|Column | Nov. 10 |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Since President Eisgruber announced his intention to create a committee to re-evaluate the controversial policy known as grade deflation, the initial furor (or excitement, or even optimism, might be better words) among the student body has largely settled down. Tiger Magazine, though, recently published a satirical article “announcing” that the committee had returned its findings early and had recommended that “no more than 10 percent of the grades given in any department should be A’s.” I found the article to be highly amusing and forwarded it to my parents, thinking little of it. Soon after, I called home (yes, there are people who still do that), only for my mom to tell me “well, that’s a bummer” and for my dad to spew out words that are, for the most part, too inappropriate to be published. Clarification revealed that my parents, reading the first paragraph or two of the article and not knowing that TigerMag regularly publishes spoof content, took the committee’s “decision” to be factual. Of course we laughed it off, but it got me thinking — does Princeton really have such a stigma of competition that the ridiculous policies proposed in the Tiger Magazine article could actually seem legitimate? And is it possible that Princeton is too oriented toward academic competition? After all, if TigerMag had published a phony article about, say, a new policy limiting the number of new organizations that can be formed on campus, their readership would have hardly have reacted as strongly. The article was even re-posted on the Class of 2017 page, in which several students posted comments along the lines of “I almost had a heart attack there.” As soon as the issue of grades arises, students and parents alike are all ears. Of course, it was first and foremost the academic aspect that catapulted Princeton to the No. 1 spot on the U.S. News and World Report’s annual college rankings. In recent years, the boom in the college-age population coupled with the increasingly widespread societal belief that a college degree is a prerequisite for future success has led to a huge rise in the applicant pool, a subsequent rise in the number of rejections doled out each year and a drop in the overall acceptance rate. These figures certainly bolster a school’s image of selectivity and, in turn, prestige through high competition. But in seeking to maintain its status, Princeton may have taken policies to promote a competitive environment worthy of its rank too far. When the school’s administration focuses so much of its attention on making academia competitive, so too will the students focus on adapting to the more aggressive atmosphere, until competition becomes the defining feature of the school. A high degree of competition, then, no longer serves as an indication of a school’s relative reputation, but rather become a prerequisite to it. So indeed, we may be seen as “too competitive.” The question then inevitably arises — is this a positive trend? It has been argued, admittedly, that competition forces students to raise their academic performance and to strive for self-improvement. Multiple studies, however, indicate that competition can also have the detrimental effects of stunting creativity, fostering hostility and lowering self-esteem, hardly ideal characteristics of a school that is supposed to be preparing students to be critical and constructive thinkers in the real world. Competition is undoubtedly an integral aspect of human life, yet it is possible for competition to be taken too far — so as to be the defining aspect of an institution of higher learning — that it ceases to be a benevolent force. Rather, we should be known for the achievements, past and present, already accomplished and being accomplished by students and faculty alike and for the opportunities provided to scholars of all races, ages and creeds. Competitiveness should not be the first word that comes to mind when you think of a school like Princeton.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

48004|~|Two models of mentorship|~|   November 10 2013|~|Column | Nov. 10 |~|Tehila Wenger|~|None|~|Toward the beginning of this academic year, Shawon Jackson sent out an email to the class of 2017 asking if they would like to participate in the Princeton Women’s Mentorship Program, now entering its third year. Students who joined had the option of “pod” or “general” membership. Those in the first category were sorted into small groups made up of one representative from each class year. General members receive emails that invite them to leadership events, but do not commit to weekly pod meetings. The idea for the pods is to meet once a week in a social capacity and develop strong relationships with other pod members that allow for mutual mentorship. Additionally, each pod is assigned a faculty member or administrator to meet with at least once a semester. This initiative is the brainchild of undergraduate women on campus in response to the 2011 Steering Committee Report on Women’s Leadership. The most directly relevant observation made by the report is that women, “perhaps even more than men,” are influenced by mentors in terms of academic and extracurricular achievement. Anecdotal evidence from faculty and students indicates that mentorship plays an important role in women’s decisions to pursue leadership positions and scholarships, but this mentorship can be difficult for women to access (possibly more so than for their male peers). The report contains another finding that is equally important for understanding the direction the mentorship program has taken. In a survey on freshman orientation, 77 percent of respondents felt that they lacked sufficient opportunities to make connections with upperclassmen. The choice to create inter-class pods is a clear response to this concern. Given that opportunities to meet upperclassmen are limited, the pod provides a structured environment for members of different years to bond. Caroline Kitchener ’14, one of the founders and current co-presidents of the mentorship initiative, asserted, “Those relationships are really the point of the program.” The intimate group setting allows freshman women to comfortably interact with older peers who can, as Kitchener puts it, “help you understand what’s going on in this place.” In the most successful situations, students keep in touch with their pod members even after some of them have graduated. Peer mentorship, however, is only half the story. The Steering Committee Report focuses on the positive effect that faculty can have on women’s decisions to apply for scholarships or leadership positions. While pods are set up with a “Pod Partner” — a Princeton faculty or staff member — these individuals are only required to meet with the group once a semester. The meeting requirement is relatively lax in order to accommodate the full schedules of the staff and faculty members involved. Of course, Princeton students are busy as well, which can lead to dysfunctional pod groups that don’t meet. This has been effectively addressed in the past by creating general membership, which weeds out students who are interested in the program but don’t have enough time for weekly meetings. Other tactics for ensuring commitment include introducing accountability and investment by assigning a “pod captain” and sponsoring restaurant meals for pods that do meet frequently. Through restructuring the program and offering incentives, WMP has managed to make the time commitment worthwhile for students. The program should now focus on how to accomplish the same thing for faculty. The program focuses more on developing relationships between students of different classes than on those between students and faculty. While having a junior or senior friend may enhance an underclassman’s social life, that friendship may never reach the stage of mentorship. In contrast, a relationship developed with a professor is rarely just a friendship. Teachers have the power to change the way students see themselves. Making a connection with an adult who has “made it” — someone in a high-profile position of success and authority — cannot be compared with the connections we make with our peers. Both are critical for students’ social and academic development on campus, but in terms of mentorship, a relationship with a faculty member is much more effective than one with another student. The Women’s Mentorship Program is an earnest attempt to provide women with a strong inter-class network, but it is an imperfect answer to the leadership disparity pointed out in the Steering Committee Report. While the program offers several lectures and workshops on leadership throughout the year, the main focus is on the pods. Isabella Lloyd-Damnjanovic ’17, a current participant in the program and a staff copy editor for The Daily Princetonian, said that she thinks about her fellow pod members “more as guides to Princeton social or academic life than mentors.” This distinction is something Rebecca Kreutter pointed out in her column last Wednesday: Advisors are not necessarily mentors. Mentorship evokes admiration and guidance, a stronger role and greater influence than someone who dispenses helpful advice. In order to create the kind of mentorship that the Steering Report indicated is necessary, faculty and staff partners in the program should be required to meet with their pods more than once a semester. One-on-one meetings between the students of a pod and their partner would build stronger relationships and might raise the faculty member’s personal investment in the group as a whole. Some of the workshops should include the staff partners in order to build mentorship ties that go beyond the student members of pods. The way that the Women’s Mentorship Program tackles the lack of social connections between students of different class years is an important step towards ameliorating the upper-underclassmen divide created by eating club culture. The problem of faculty mentorship remains on the table, and with certain changes of programming and prioritization, the Women’s Mentorship Program could be pivotal in closing the gap.|~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio.

48024|~|Editorial: Midsemester evaluations|~|   November 10 2013|~|Editorial | Nov. 10 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|As students prepare to choose classes for the spring semester, course reviews become increasingly important. Currently, Registrar-administered course evaluations are administered at the end of every semester, after lectures and precepts have ended. However, these evaluations have many downsides. As end-of-the-semester evaluations do not affect the students writing them, they are often rushed or not completed. Additionally, the evaluations of the current system are likely non-representative because they cannot include feedback from students who dropped the course and because students’ responses are influenced by their expected grades. An effective solution to these problems would be the addition of an online mid-semester course evaluation system. Aside from a few professors who ask students for mid-term evaluations, there is no regular opportunity for mid-semester student feedback. As such, the Editorial Board strongly encourages the development and implementation of a mid-semester course evaluation system that should be accessible both to professors and students seeking to enroll in the course in subsequent semesters. There is already significant student demand for a standardized system for mid-semester evaluations. According to a Spring 2012 study in the Academic Life Total Assessment by the Undergraduate Student Government, “66 percent of students strongly or somewhat support having the option to give feedback after midterm week.” Questions could be taken from the existing course evaluations system with anonymized responses aggregated and provided to professors and other students to view online. The first benefit of the proposed feedback system is that evaluations can have an immediate impact for students currently enrolled in the course. Feedback for lectures, precepts, labs and homework assignments, for example, could be taken into account by the course professor and used to make changes for the second half of the semester. On the other hand, end-of-the-semester evaluations made after the course has ended only allow a professor to make changes for the next class, providing no benefit for students who took the course that semester. This is relevant to the second advantage of the proposed system: if students are likely to experience changes in a course they are enrolled in, they have a greater incentive to give thorough feedback. This would promote two principal benefits: a larger proportion of students would participate in the feedback process, and their evaluations would likely be more specific and constructive, as evaluations could now meaningfully impact the second semester of the course. The improved response rate and higher quality of responses would benefit future students contemplating enrolling in the course. A third unique benefit of mid-semester course evaluations is that they would include the feedback of students planning to drop the course. For someone deciding whether or not to take a class, reading about other students’ reasons for dropping a course — whether it was too difficult or not interesting, for example — can be valuable. And with more perfect information, student demand for poorly-reviewed, highly-dropped courses will decrease while demand for better-reviewed courses would increase, resulting in better course selection overall. Finally, the relative lack of certainty about grades mid-semester can result in more honest feedback; students are more likely to praise a course they are getting a good grade in and more likely to provide negative feedback if their grades are lower. If students are less confident about what their grades will be during the middle of the semester as compared to the end of the semester, student feedback will be more independent of expected grades and be less affected by bias. As for when the proposed mid-semester course evaluations should be administered, the board believes the seventh week of classes is optimal. After midterms week, students have had ample time and experience in a course to provide constructive feedback for the professor and other students interested in the class. Additionally, the seventh week of classes occurs after fall and spring break; the week after midterms can be effectively spent determining what a student enjoys or dislikes about his or her courses. And midterms are often a major factor in students’ decisions to drop or pass/D/fail a course. With a week’s worth of distance between midterm exams and mid-semester evaluations, students would be able to provide constructive and specific feedback for their professor as well as other students. The board suggests piloting the program within a few departments before being expanded across the University. Eventually, questions could be tailored specifically to departments or even individual courses. The board is confident that a mid-semester evaluation program could improve students’ experiences in a course and also provide students with more accurate feedback during the course selection process.|~|

47773|~|Editorial: Defending free speech on campus|~|   November 7 2013|~|Editorial | Nov. 7 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Recently, former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly was asked to speak at Brown University about the controversial policy of “Stop and Frisk,” which he had helped to implement during the Bloomberg Administration. Before the former commissioner could speak, however, Brown University students interrupted the lecture and prevented Mr. Kelly from making any remarks whatsoever. With these recent events in mind, the Editorial Board believes that our campus community — both students and administration — should recommit itself to upholding the principles of free speech in accordance with the University’s broader educational mission. In stark contrast to the events at Brown University, a recent event on our campus demonstrates proper academic discourse in line with the principles of free speech. The Anscombe Society recently invited Ryan Anderson to give a talk defending a traditional view of marriage. Student protesters did not interrupt Mr. Anderson during his talk. Instead, the protesters voiced their objections by asking productive questions during the Q&A session. Lacking fighting words, incitement or heckling, the ensuing discussion enabled students on both sides of the debate to hear each other’s arguments, hopefully increasing mutual understanding. We believe that the University community should model future speaking events on the paradigm of respectful discourse manifest at the Anderson event. The board believes that speaker events must be conducted according to the following principle: Speakers have a right not merely to speak but also be heard. It follows that protests should be held in manners that respect the speaker’s right to be heard and that help to further dialogue instead of stalling it outright. The University’s treatment of protests in Rights, Rules, Responsibilities is consistent with the aims of free speech and respect for dialogue, and we commend the University for the policy. The board does believe that there should be a few guidelines in place for selecting speakers to come to campus. First and foremost, an invited speaker must have a topic and view that is appropriate to an academic forum and that advances the educational mission of the University. “Fighting words” and incitements to violence are clearly inappropriate. There should also be some minimum of student interest to warrant bringing a speaker to campus; such interest can serve as an informal test of determining whether the speaker will advance community knowledge or will be speaking on a subject that students deem relevant. If the University or student group is to fund the costs of the speaker (i.e. traveling expenses), the lecture must be open to opposing voices, respectful, and in the advancement of intellectual or cultural endeavors. Some may worry that upholding a clear prerogative for free speech for invited guests may lead to the hosting of speakers with views that flagrantly offend general decency (e.g., racial supremacists). However, the board maintains that it is important to hear minority perspectives: members of the community capable of independent thought will not be swayed by an irrational, indecent viewpoint. Rather, such a viewpoint should and will be discredited on its merits alone. It is for individuals — not a higher authority — to decide what is creditable and what is not. The board also does not believe that the prestige and marginal benefit a speaker gains from speaking on campus to be significant enough to warrant banning them from speaking. Free speech is the cornerstone of intellectual enlightenment and educational advancement. Without the ability to openly debate an issue with all viewpoints present and able to defend themselves, an educational institution risks becoming a farce. The marketplace of ideas works best when that marketplace is truly free. We hope the University will continue to protect free speech on this campus and that students will uphold the importance of respectful discourse.|~|
47776|~|Money for rankings|~|   November 7 2013|~|Column | Nov. 7 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|This Monday, the Editorial Board conditionally endorsed the White House’s college ranking system and its plan to award Pell Grants based on these rankings.  Though I appreciate the desire for accountability in higher education, a one-size-fits all college ranking system directly tied to financial awards to the school is simply the wrong approach. The plan not only distorts the choices students make between schools and schools make in educating students, it fundamentally devalues college education by treating it as a mundane commodity and ignores the causes of poor student performance even as it claims to address the symptoms. It is of course important to ensure that students (and their grantor, the federal government) are not being defrauded by woefully inadequate schools. Recently a number of for-profit colleges came under fire for aggressively recruiting low-income students, taking the money they brought in through Pell Grants, then leaving them adrift after graduation. This blatant exploitation of the system called for increased vigilance and accountability, and the federal government responded appropriately, disciplining the schools and their accrediting institution. But such exploitation of the Pell Grant program is not the target of Obama’s rankings. Rather, the ranking system would foster competition among even the best-ranked schools. This would supposedly encourage schools to provide a superb education — but how can we define “superb” with a mere list of metrics? The simple fact is, no ranking system can adequately measure the complex myriad of characteristics which make an education valuable to the student. Current, private, college ranking systems from Forbes and U.S. News and World Report, among others, are already problematic; they encourage schools to fit their narrow definition of good, and colleges have been known to act improperly to inflate their rankings. And with these rankings, the incentives are all indirect – how much more distorted will rankings be when they are directly tied to federal moneys? No matter which metrics are chosen, schools will immediately feel pressure to focus on these narrow aspects of their educational experiences, tying their hands in efforts to innovate education just as such efforts are becoming critical. Educators and administrators recognize this, and are resistant to the plan because of it. Said Jon A. Story, senior associate dean of Purdue’s graduate school quoted in the Purdue Exponent on Monday: “The system of university ranking that does not acknowledge the full scope of what we really do is misleading.” And how does the administration propose to rank the outcomes of an undergraduate degree? Secretary of Education Arne Duncan lists “graduation and transfer rates, alumni satisfaction surveys, graduate earnings and the advanced degrees of college graduates” as possibilities. While these are, individually, telling statistics about a given school, the idea that they could, taken together, put a comprehensive number on the value of a college degree is preposterous. The emphasis on graduate earnings is disturbing – how much more do we need to incentivize schools to push I-Banking and consulting? But worse is what the list lacks — any measure of critical thinking skills gained through an education. A 2011 study found that 45 percent of students showed no gain in cognitive skills after two years of college. The American Association of Colleges and Universities found in a survey this spring that nearly all employers found critical thinking and creative problem-solving more important than a student’s undergraduate major, but employability is only the tip of the iceberg. The same skills employers listed as important — “ethical judgment and integrity; intercultural skills; and the capacity for continued new learning” — are critical to a dynamic democracy and culture. While advanced degrees and postgraduate earnings provide an indirect measure of such skills, no metric can measure the impact that a school has on a student’s psyche. Perhaps a test of cognitive skills would be an appropriate metric to include in the government’s rankings? Unfortunately, as we have seen time and again in public schooling, such high-stakes testing distorts education even more than simply taking metrics. High-stakes testing in primary and secondary school and this new attempt to rate post-secondary institutions are both emblematic of a misguided, one-size-fits-all approach to education. Since different students have different needs, the government would be ill-served to pressure them into institutions where their Pell Grants were worth more, merely because the school fits an arbitrary metric. The administration’s plan tries to solve two problems — Pell Grant waste and ineffective education — with one “magic bullet” which simply won’t do. Too often low-income and first-generation college students fail to attend top-notch schools not because they are unqualified but because they aren’t aware they are qualified because they lack the guidance available to luckier students. If the government wants to make sure Pell Grant monies are spent on superb educations, it should work with excellent colleges, and with Pell Grant students before they graduate high school, to ensure that these students are at a school which will educate and challenge them. Here the data Obama proposes collecting will be helpful to students in their search — it is only when paired with supposedly comprehensive ratings that it becomes dangerous. The quality of college education as a whole is a separate issue, and one that should be addressed through the concerted efforts of educators and the encouragement and support of the federal government, rather than the strictly monetary carrots and sticks that the administration proposes.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a sophomore from Littleton, Colo.

47719|~|Outside the Bubble: Five things you need to know about energy|~|   November 7 2013|~|Column | Nov. 7 |~|Kinnari Shah|~|   Columnist     |~|Talking energy is like talking pop culture these days. I keep having the same type of conversation, and I keep running into the same kinds of misconceptions about the field. I think new and exciting solutions, whether they be new technologies or improvements to old designs, are out there, and it’s important to keep pursuing them. But how we go about that process is a matter of contention. The problem is that it’s becoming too easy for the public to be swept by some new technology they’ve heard about and to immediately champion it without fully considering its current state and its future viability. Unless you have some background in this area, in what goes into a full assessment of any system or technology, you really have to base your beliefs on other people’s opinions. The problem is that a good amount of the mainstream information out there is written by people who don’t have the necessary background to give an accurate representation. Sometimes, they focus on the wrong details or fail to address the whole picture. As a result, we tend to hear about some new technology or system and immediately think to ourselves, “hey, maybe that could work. Why aren’t we doing that? Why isn’t that everywhere?” We don’t give due considerations to the right kinds of questions: What would need to happen to implement these changes? Is it viable? To avoid falling into this trap ever again, there are five things you should always keep in mind when talking energy. First: There is NO be-all and end-all solution. No one technology is going to fix everything. This seems obvious when you say it out loud, but it’s easy to forget. Recognize that what will work depends highly on geographic location. In some regions, conversion of natural gas to diesel may be absurd; in others, it is an economical and efficient solution. The upshot is that we can’t talk about energy without contextualizing ourselves based on geographic location. Even then, don’t forget that a portfolio of options is better than just one, especially when talking about renewables. You cannot champion one technology as the solution to everything. Second: Consider the whole picture. For example, what is the water usage of your technology? Water isn’t as freely available and renewable as the water cycle diagram might naively lead us to believe. We have to consider volume usage, volume consumption (which doesn’t return back to the source), heat and contaminant pollution, the costs and structures associated with cleaning used water. Another major consideration that we often overlook is lifetime CO2 production. This is not the amount of carbon dioxide that your own technology emits. It is the amount of CO2 produced from the cradle-to-grave cycle. Take, for example, electric cars. I’m excited for the future of electrification. But I won’t sit here and tell you that it is currently zero emissions — electricity is still largely made from coal and natural gas plants, which do emit CO2. I think it’s a mistake to limit discussion to just the technology at hand and not consider the entire picture. There can be quite a few hidden CO2 costs when we move to major-scale operation and we must address their implications. Third: Just because a solution is possible does not make it economically viable. This is a big one. Unless we are talking about some simpler fixes to make existing technology more efficient, then there is quite a bit to think about before putting a whole new system in place. What are the costs (capital and operating) associated with replacing old systems with newer but more expensive equipment and are they realistic for staying in operation? What are the costs associated with creating new infrastructures to handle more dangerous and explosive fuels? What are the costs associated with feedstock, wastes and contaminants? Keep in mind that feasibility is vastly different from viability. That being said, it’s important to know the difference between technologies that are not economically viable and technologies that are not but could be economically viable. For example, how do government subsidies come into play? Fourth: Energy is art. It requires quite a bit of creativity and ingenuity in design. And it takes time to get it just right. Fifth: The future of energy is highly dependent on politics and public opinion. These two things can make or break certain technologies. Everything hinges on this point. Our ability to be informed rather than misinformed, to be analytic rather than easily swept up by every other new technology or breakthrough we hear about, is absolutely critical. The public’s ability to assess energy technologies in the right way will be the greatest contributing factor to creating solutions. This is a major challenge that our generation faces. We need to make sure we do it right. Kinnari Shah is a chemical and biological engineering major from Washington, N.J. She can be reached at kmshah@princeton.edu.|~|

47519|~|Outside the Bubble: The Republican road to victory |~|   November 6 2013|~|Column | Nov. 6 |~|David Will|~|None|~|Millennials grew up hearing about American exceptionalism, mostly in the context of its decline. Unfortunately, the past several months and years have only added to the pessimistic narrative. Shutting down the government of the world’s greatest democracy cuts against the idea that we as a nation are anything special. Discussions of default are worthy of far-flung, third-world countries that are rife with corruption and short on prosperity. A superpower does not lurch from one crisis to the next. Leaders in Washington approach short-term deals like triage for their slew of self-inflicted wounds. The government shutdown was a national embarrassment. It arose from an incoherent political strategy concocted by the Republican Party’s extreme faction. The adults in the room warned the Tea Party that their tactics would fail. Yet Senator Ted Cruz and his followers persisted in sewing dysfunction. Instead of negotiating to keep the government open in the days before the shutdown, Cruz bloviated on the Senate floor. The result? The Republican Party’s popularity sunk to a new low, and the Affordable Care Act remained fully funded. Senator Cruz and other irresponsible Republicans falsely divided the party on the Affordable Care Act. It is one issue on which all conservatives agree. Suddenly, if you did not want to risk the country’s full faith and credit, you were a member of the “surrender caucus.” That’s exactly the problem with Senator Cruz and the Tea Party. It’s obvious what they’re against, but it’s difficult to pinpoint specifically what they’re for. In Senator Cruz’s first year in office, I have not heard him introduce an originally conservative idea. That is, Cruz has not offered actual alternatives to the bills that he has opposed. Responsible Republicans earned the nickname RINOs, which stands for “Republican in name only,” for opposing the shutdown. It’s a pithy, anti-intellectual label that conservatives fling at one another to avoid substantively discussing their differences. That’s the level to which the party has sunk. Ad hominem skirmishes have replaced clashes of ideas. Few republicans in Washington, it seems, are interested in fighting for the bold proposals needed to rehabilitate the party’s brand. Republicans should have rebutted every item on Obama’s first term agenda with a coherent alternative. A tort reform bill that also liberated insurance companies to compete across state lines should have countered Obamacare. Republicans could have answered the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill by teaming with Democrats to impose capital requirements on big banks and reestablish the separation between commercial and investment banks. The future of the GOP does not depend on everyone in the party agreeing with these ideas. What matters is that people who feel differently respond with policy proposals of their own, not just opposition. William F. Buckley, the father of the modern conservative movement, famously advocated running the most conservative candidates who could win. Well, as it turns out, the Todd Akin, Sarah Palin blend of ignorance and extremity is not a formula for success. But one electoral humiliation after another has only hardened some Republicans’ resolve. There are those who believe Mitt Romney lost because he was not far-right enough. He advocated “self-deportation” and sneered at 47 percent of the country, but apparently that didn’t suffice. This is a toxic mentality. It will cause the party to purify itself into oblivion, alienating one voting group after another. Thankfully, the leadership vacuum that plagues Washington has not metastasized to the rest of the country. There are 30 Republican governors, several of whom, I believe, could be the next president of the United States. The most successful among them just coasted to reelection right here in deep-blue New Jersey. He’s no squishy moderate, either. Governor Christie is ardently pro-life and against gun control. More importantly, he’s worked with Democrats to take on the public-sector unions and balance the budget without raising taxes. Christie is a case study of the party’s potential for a bright future, one centered on ideas and a pragmatic approach to governing. The party can only benefit from adding Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Susana Martinez of New Mexico to the potential 2016 presidential field. The good news for Republicans is that the party does not face a deficit of innovative solutions for the country’s problems, only a shortage of people in Washington to advocate for them. That’s why, ahead of 2016, I’ll be looking far outside the nation’s capital for the GOP’s next class of dynamic leaders.|~|David Will is a religion major from Chevy Chase, Md.

47527|~|Modern couples|~|   November 6 2013|~|Column | Nov. 6 |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I love to people-watch, especially when I am in unfamiliar places. So, naturally, when my boyfriend and I finished up our lunch during our day trip to Sedona, I was content to simply observe as my food digested. The patio, hugging the sidewalk outside the restaurant, provided generous opportunities for me to survey both my fellow diners and those passing by. However, it was not the occasional mountain-lady walking by and sporting a “vegan love” T-shirt that gave me reason to shake my head, but rather the other patrons in the pizzeria, those who I have begun to call “modern couples.” Modern couples have become a national epidemic, originally contained to the younger generations yet slowly infecting the middle-aged and soon perhaps the elderly. Even worse, the behavior exhibited by modern couples is not even limited to couples, but can exist in any friendly gathering of two or more. These modern couples, as I have dubbed them, are those who have replaced mealtime conversation and interaction with mutual (yet separate) texting, browsing and gaming. Increasingly advanced technology has given nearly everyone affordable and convenient access to smartphones and all the capabilities that go along with them, but I believe such accessibility has come at a disturbing cost. As I glanced around the restaurant, I saw a woman tapping away at a colorful iPhone screen while her husband took a phone call; a group of women who were all either engaged with their phones or had them laid out on the table; and the only other diner — sitting alone and thus most justified to use technology for preoccupation — left his phone in his pocket, if he had one at all.  This is not an isolated case either; I have seen parents play a movie on an iPad to placate their child at a restaurant, and when I worked at Starbucks, people who came in together would order, wait and leave without taking their eyes off their phone screens and without saying a word to each other. For me, shared meals have always meant shared conversation; I see the modern couples’ perversion of it as cold, impersonal and borderline disrespectful. If a meal is spent with so little interaction with your companion, why dine together at all? Technology, including the smartphone, has given us incredible capacity to reach and process information anywhere and at anytime. But such progress should be an aid to us, not a distraction that interferes with our real-world relationships. Modern couples are an example of such a distraction. When I accept an invitation to eat out (or in) with someone, I expect that they are doing so because they find me engaging and interesting, and in accepting the offers I probably think the same of them. I eat with my friends to laugh and share stories; I eat with my boyfriend to relax and to enjoy each other’s company and love; I eat with my family to appreciate and relate. There is no one I eat with so that I can share an uninterrupted meal of tweeting and messaging. If someone can’t put away their phone or tablet for the duration of a short meal, it’s unlikely that they will be able to unplug completely in most aspects of their life. I don’t mean to be the person knelling the toll of the computer-apocalypse, but when half of a restaurant is holding their phone instead of their date’s hand, I think there’s some sort of disconnect. We are a technological generation, and I’m not trying to change that. Our collection of computers and screens has given us more than it has taken away, but we are allowing it to take more than it should. Every time I see a modern couple, smiling at Instagram posts instead of the person across the table, I get a rush of nostalgia for the pre-cell phone era I never even experienced, and I can’t help but feel like I’m witnessing some profound death. We are constantly juggling an endless list of tasks and activities, half-engaged and always in motion; mealtime is traditionally a break in the cycle, allowing us to breathe in the present and focus just on our fellow diners and our palates. With so much of our modern day lives crammed with noise, why pollute the small sanctity meals offer with more of the same? And so I call for a reformation, for a dramatic rejection of the modern couple inside the microcosm of Princeton, and a return to the pairing of fine food with fine conversation (or, in the case of the dining halls, the elevation of mediocre food with superior conversation). Next time you ask for a table for two, make it truly a dinner for two; ignore the buzzing in your pocket, replace the “lols” with real laughter and make your own memories instead of living vicariously through status updates.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

47515|~|The myth of the mentor|~|   November 6 2013|~|Column | Nov. 6 |~|Rebecca Kreutter|~|None|~|Society tells us that young, impressionable and impressive undergraduates like ourselves should have mentors. Pick up any memoir from someone considered successful in his or her field, and it will mention the mentors that helped along the way: the college professors, the first bosses, the nice old neighbors with their sassy but unexpectedly spot-on advice. As Ken Perlman described in a Forbes article titled “The Often Overlooked but Invaluable Benefits of Mentorship,” a mentor “can help cultivate leadership skills one-on-one in real-time, reduce the anxiety in taking big steps and focus leaders on achieving their goals.” Gwen Moran from Entrepreneurship.com adds that we should “forget advisors” and focus on finding high-level “power mentors” with expansive networks. Add to this the Jack Donaghy-Liz Lemon and Dr. Cox-J.D. relationships from pop culture, and you have the Mentor. Approachable, available and a leader in his or her field, a mentor gives advice but also lets the mentees fail every once in a while to engrain the lesson more fully. More importantly, the mentor is always there whenever the mentee is having a professional or personal struggle. The pressure is on. Find a mentor or risk never achieving your goals. To cope with this demand for mentors, Princeton offers formal mentorship programs, from the Princeton’s Women Mentorship Program to the Latinos Unidos for Networking and Advising. Extracurriculars supplement these with their own programs and with lists of alumni to contact. While these are all valuable programs, they continue to perpetuate the idea that to succeed you need the perfect mentor to walk you through life’s challenges. I have felt this pressure to find a mentor myself when asking for letters of recommendation, filling out surveys gauging how many professors I know well and reflecting on who I can talk to for post-grad advice. It can feel at times that if you’re not going to office hours, engaging with professors one-on-one and developing working relationships now, you will graduate having passed up an amazing opportunity to connect with knowledgeable and open faculty members, administrators and alumni. One difficulty in finding a mentor, however, is that it can feel disingenuous and forced. After all, you don’t want to waste your mentor’s time, especially if they are busy with their Important Power Lives. In Sheryl Sandberg’s book on women’s leadership, “Lean In,” she addresses this pressure to find a mentor in her chapter “Are You My Mentor?” Sandberg points out that “If someone has to ask the question, the answer is probably no. When someone finds the right mentor, it is obvious.” She claims that women, in particular, have a hard time developing these relationships naturally and resort to asking people point-blank to mentor them. At first I was disconcerted, caught in a double bind. I have to be assertive and proactive about finding a mentor, yet if I reach out to potential mentors, maybe not as obviously as throwing around the M-word, it can seem forced. Thankfully, Sandberg did not stop there. She goes on to talk about one young woman she had advised who once told her she had “never had a mentor,” even though Sandberg considered herself a mentor to the young woman. The woman was looking for someone she could talk to for an hour every week. Sandberg writes, “That’s not a mentor — that’s a therapist.” It was then that I realized that the problem with mentorship is not so much about finding the perfect relationship as letting go of the idea of perfection to begin with. If I’m looking for a Jack Donaghy, I’m going to end up disappointed. It seems obvious after reading it, but a mentor is not a guardian angel looking out for your every move. Mentorship is not an exclusive partnership between that one perfect Mentor and her devoted mentee. Most of all, it is not a pre-cut relationship, but one that evolves over time. You may not realize you had a mentor until you are asked to reflect 10 years from now on how you got to where you are. Looking around, I can see that I have several people I turn to for advice more often than others. I wouldn’t call these people mentors, but then I don’t need to. After all, there is no better way to end a budding mentorship than to ask, “Where is this relationship going?” No, the first step for me is not to search out the mythical Mentor. It is to admit to someone more knowledgeable than myself that I need advice — not always, not forever, but for this one moment.  We’ll see where it goes from there.|~|Rebecca Kreutter is a Wilson School major from Singapore, Singapore.

47298|~|The road not taken|~|   November 5 2013|~|Column | Nov. 5 |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|Strangely enough, if you were to ask me right now what the most difficult part of Princeton has been for me thus far, my answer would not include workload, grade deflation or organic chemistry. Granted, these aspects have not been easy for me in any stretch of the imagination. I struggle with time management, grades and amine functional groups just as much as the next guy. But on a day-to-day basis, these are not the things I worry about most as a Princeton student. What I struggle with most is simply deciding what to study and where to focus my future after Princeton. College is arguably the most important time in our adult lives. It’s a sort of crossroads, an intersection that can take you anywhere in life you want to go. And when one considers an Ivy League institution like Princeton, that crossroads becomes much, much larger. From the first week on campus, one thing is pounded into our heads again and again — entering Princeton as a freshman means that your options in life are limitless. From medical school to law school, nonprofits in Africa to Wall Street investment companies, electrical engineering to classics, anything you can imagine doing is possible, and that is simply terrifying. This phenomenon has been noted in psychological studies before, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as choice overload.  Simply put, past a certain point, an increasing number of options presented to a person can result in less satisfaction with the outcome. Having more options results in greater anxiety about missing the optimal choice. There will always be the leftover “what if” feeling, especially after decisions as important as what college to attend or what career path to follow. With this in mind, it is essential to ask, “What is the optimal amount of freedom to allow students?” More importantly, when does the amount of freedom cease being beneficial for the student? As a liberal arts institution, Princeton encourages you to explore many different fields of academics over your first two years.  As I see it, the combination of distribution requirements paired with the mandatory two years before declaring a major has two main purposes. First, it is to promote interdisciplinary thought and well-rounded students through an exploration of many different subjects. I admire this goal and fully support it. The second is to allow students to discover new subjects that they could pursue academically, ones that they may not have otherwise focused on. But is this really conducive to a richer and more fulfilling major choice?  Initially, that was one of the most appealing aspects of Princeton to me, that I could delay the inevitable choice of a career another two years, and that the answer would eventually just come to me after getting a bite-sized portion of an assortment of classes and subjects. In retrospect, I don’t see any benefit from delaying a major choice for two full years. It’s because of this that I question whether the academic freedom of Princeton has really been beneficial to me. The liberal arts aspect of Princeton is, in many ways, effective. While many students attempt to circumvent the requirements with easy classes, many students do genuinely explore areas that they never would have before. This is great for producing well-rounded students; however, this does not necessarily facilitate better major choices. Often, this does not make choosing a major easier but, in fact, more difficult. Perhaps intentionally delaying major choices until the end of sophomore year offers an unnecessarily excessive amount of choice. Entering Princeton as a freshman already comes with a huge amount of options.  Do I really need another two years to add to the long list of choices I have? If I had declared a major during freshman year, I would have saved myself two more years of stressful decisions that, in the end, would not make me any happier.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pa.

47295|~|Time for Princeton women to lean in|~|   November 5 2013|~|Column | Nov. 5 |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|Welcome to the 21st century, where women and men are supposedly treated equally and enjoy the same opportunities. Princeton’s Class of 2017 is almost equally divided between men and women, as are other Ivy League freshman classes. Women and men have an equal opportunity at Princeton to apply for leadership positions. So half of the clubs and organizations should be led by women, right? Wrong. When I walk into a Whig-Clio debate, all the speakers are male. And USG leadership, either campus-wide or class-wide? The same. When you look at the overall leadership numbers, the problem is even more staggering. At the beginning of coeducation, the “leadership gap” wasn’t much of an issue. Women were eagerly reaching for and attaining prominent roles on campus. Across high-profile campus posts, including president of the student government, chair of the Honor Committee, editor-in-chief of The Daily Princetonian and president of the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior classes, six women in the 1970s held those positions, 18 in the 1980s and 22 in the 1990s. But in the first decade of the 21st century, there were only 12 women filling these roles. These numbers grabbed officials’ attention at the University two years ago, when the school convened a blue-ribbon committee and issued a report known as the Keohane Report. Quite frankly, after acknowledging the female leadership void, the report offers little in the way of innovative recommendations to change the status quo. There is no urgency in its tone. Indeed, the report only recommends that the issue be re-examined in 10 years. But just by looking at the numbers or merely attending campus events, it’s nearly impossible to miss the problem. And, as the report notes, it is not just an issue at Princeton. The problem exists on many other college campuses. This is a cultural problem around the United States and the world. Understanding the broader problem, I acknowledge that, in the pursuit of leadership equity, there is a limit as to how much the school or the law can do. Nevertheless, Princeton could do more than it is currently doing. The university, legally and ethically, must ensure an environment of equal opportunity. Women must have the same options as men. And we do. No one can stop me from applying for or attaining a leadership position. And I certainly wouldn’t want to attain such a title because the school had forced clubs to set aside a certain number of leadership roles for women. I want to earn a position as a result of all I’ve accomplished and the skills I’ve acquired. As the report recommends, the University’s Women’s Center holds events to empower women on campus and tries to encourage leadership. There are mentorship programs both among women students and female professors. In this respect, the school is pulling its weight. The school has a responsibility to guarantee equal opportunity and ought to try to encourage women to be more ambitious. After all, they were accepted to Princeton just like the men. Of course, more can always be done, but the fact that there are resources going to these programs is a start. And, hopefully, it will help put a dent in those statistics over the next decade. But what is really needed is for everyone on campus, male and female, to take a hard look at ourselves and our attitudes. The report found that women here at Princeton consistently undersold themselves, while male students stressed their accomplishments. Women need to take initiative and ownership of the problem and not look to anyone else for a hand up. Lack of female leadership has been and will continue to be a problem, both on and off campus, until women put forth a conscious and united effort to change it. That is the argument of Sheryl Sandberg, current COO of Facebook, in her book “Lean In.” Sandberg notes that women have to make a genuine effort to try to change perceptions and the norm. Women have to apply for positions even if they are not sure they are qualified and speak up about their opinions in corporate meetings. In her New York Times review of the book, University professor emerita Anne-Marie Slaughter extends this responsibility to both women and the corporate culture as a whole. And both are right. We all need to work toward change. Students and the University have a responsibility to reverse the trend of inequality among student and faculty leadership. The school could do more to make this an issue on the forefront of everyone’s mind, here and outside the Orange Bubble. Princeton should not only sensitize women to this issue but also faculty, staff and male students. Frequent lectures or public discussions among administration and students can encourage people across campus to take action to change the status quo. College is just the place to start molding future leaders — future leaders of both genders.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C. She can be reached at mlmorse@princeton.edu. 
47364|~|Forgetting I'm Asian|~|   November 5 2013|~|Column | Nov. 5 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Some people forget their jackets on the Street. Others forget to turn in their problem sets on time. I forget that I’m Asian. It may seem like a confusing confession, but with a last name like Dinovelli, it’s easier than you’d think. However, as an anxious freshman, worried about the difficulties of writing sem, it was the least of my concerns. Hurrying to the writing center one winter morning, I hoped to receive some sage advice to keep my essay from going the way of the Titanic. Unsurprisingly, I was the only one in the room early on a weekend morning. Writing my name on the sign-up list, I took a seat and waited my turn. My solitude was brief. Soon after, another student entered the room, looked at the clipboard and sat down. Assuming I was not the only one taking advantage of the morning rush (or lack thereof), I paid little attention to her occasional stares. However, after a minute or two of silence, she approached, asking, “Hi, do you know a Ben Dinovelli? I’m supposed to have a meeting with him.” She was looking for me. It wasn’t the first time, nor the last, but rather one of a myriad of instances where my name has presented itself as a source of confusion for others. As an Asian adopted by white parents, I am no stranger to the dreaded question: “I know where you’re from, but where are you really from?” Trust me, the awkwardness doesn’t go away with time. Having been raised in a predominately white town by white parents, it’s easy for me to forget that my name and appearance do not naturally mix. After all, how many Asian-Italians have you met recently? When comments are made about Asians, it doesn’t always instantly click that sometimes I’m the one being referred to. Throughout my life, I’ve always felt like a Red Sox fan with a Yankee jersey eternally glued to my chest, having been judged for and associated with my race despite my predominately white upbringing. I have been jokingly called a “Twinkie,” as if being called “basically white” could placate me. And I’m not the only one. It seems that many Asian-American students at Princeton face a binary conflict between either embracing, or distancing, themselves from their “Asian” culture. Although rarely spoken aloud, being around large groups of other Asians is seen as a personal promotion of “Asian-ness.” Some embrace their Asian-ness and surround themselves with large groups of other Asians, joining cultural campus groups, such as CSA, KASA and AASA. I found it embarrassing and tried to completely sever ties to my ethnicity; I hid behind a veil of racial blindness and said my race didn’t determine who I was. As an incoming freshman, there was a pressure on campus to assimilate to the Princeton culture, which is historically and predominately white. As Asian American Studies advocate Frank Odo ’61 mentioned in a recent interview with The Daily Princetonian, one of the biggest challenges he faced on campus was trying to “fit in with a whole bunch of white guys.” While the racial composition of the campus has changed dramatically over the years, this mindset of trying to belong still exists. The desire to fit in indirectly influenced the friends I made and the activities to which I committed myself. Although I didn’t count the number of Asians every time I sat down at a table, I felt weird being in a large group of Asians — as if by virtue of being there I was placing a large neon sign above my head. I feared being stereotyped. I feared being defined by my race. I feared that others would assume that I was someone I was not. While most students at Princeton are not adopted, many, especially those from backgrounds that include other cultures, still have to choose how much they should integrate themselves when they come to campus. Unfortunately, for many this means choosing a side and thus abandoning some part of themselves in the process. Maybe I should be upset at myself for not embracing my “true” Asian culture, or maybe I should be more grateful for being an “honorary member” of Team White. To be honest, I am still at a loss regarding how to express my identity. However, perhaps I don’t have to forget a part of myself in order to embrace the other. Maybe the two can be reconciled.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn. He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu. 
47152|~|A waste of a good time|~|   November 4 2013|~|Column | Nov. 4 |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|In her Oct. 1 column, “The cult of exclusivity,” Katherine Zhao discusses how the Princeton experience can often feel like “getting hit by a long string of rejections.” She laments that Princeton’s culture has the habit of excluding students from the exact extracurricular activities they had once thought they had excelled at in high school. If we think about it, this culture prevails even in the academic sphere of Princeton students’ lives. While walking out of Frick Chemistry Laboratory after having finished an organic chemistry lab, I saw a friend of mine huddled over her laptop, looking fairly morose and a bit beaten up. She started venting about how she had bombed her physics midterm, subsequently decided to drop the course and was now deliberating whether or not it would be worth it for her to continue being an engineer. Watching her feel as though she had failed at what she had originally set out to do at Princeton, I began to question the unforgiving nature of Princeton’s education system and the system of other similarly rigorous universities. Prerequisites, such as PHY 103: General Physics I, should be more like introductory or skill-teaching courses that allow us to venture off and explore the myriad of departmentals and electives the University has to offer. However, for many majors, they become checkpoints of “go” or “no go” — determinants for whether or not the student believes he will be able to succeed in the department based on his own performance and in comparison with his peers due to grade deflation. But it really shouldn’t be this way. If a student is in love with a department and sincerely hopes to join it, then prerequisite classes should not convince the student that the department will be too overwhelming and therefore undesirable. After all, even though Princeton is a challenge, it’s such a shame when the level of difficulty of prerequisite classes dissuades the student from delving beyond the preliminary and studying what he is truly interested in. The truth is that every major has its challenges — that one class that nearly everyone stresses over and pulls all-nighters for just to survive. But students shouldn’t feel completely deterred from a department, and a class should never make a student feel as if he has to give up altogether because he is not matching up to his classmates. Regardless of how the University perceives itself, number 1 status and all, it should still acknowledge that its students won’t constantly be at the top of their game in every class — and it’s not the end of the world if this happens. Having written columns on mental health on campus and what students have experienced after making the difficult decision to withdraw for a year due to academic struggles, I realized that Princeton doesn’t really give students a second chance should they run into problems with workload and class performance. With so many limitations, even the pass/D/fail option could hardly be considered a second chance either, especially as it cannot be used for classes in one’s major. I’m not saying we should expect less of ourselves or that it’s okay to downplay unsatisfactory grades. However, I do think that there should be a greater emphasis on the value of learning and internalizing information — even if it takes time or repetition — rather than on one’s success relative to others. For example, as a student who regrettably tanked the first time she took the first semester of organic chemistry, I didn’t feel as though others would understand my desire to try it again during my sophomore spring. My thinking was that I didn’t want to walk away from the class having learned nothing, or rather having learned that I didn’t have it in me to understand the material. Considering that our time at Princeton is so limited and valuable, I wasn’t okay with the possibility that I might leave Princeton having wasted a class. And looking back, I realize that it was right of me to think this way — that I was appreciating the extraordinary opportunity to be educated by exceptional professors in challenging courses. But no one else, at that time, had assured me that it was legitimate and acceptable for me to ask for a second chance. Princeton can do this so simply by changing its culture and reformatting the expectations that students force upon themselves, such as by bringing up the fact that it’s okay to drop a class and take it again when we feel more ready, saying that the typical paths of study are recommended but not required (especially considering that no student here is really “typical”) and recognizing that a failed grade on an exam doesn’t equate to being a failure. Our time at Princeton shouldn’t be about realizing everything that we don’t or can’t do. It should be about taking advantage of new opportunities and shaping what we do based on what we now know about ourselves. Because if it’s not that, then it’s just a waste of what could have potentially been a really good time.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.

47169|~|Doing college right|~|   November 4 2013|~|Column | Nov. 4 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|A few weeks ago, one of my favorite high school teachers sent a message via Facebook to several of my friends in Boston demanding that they “stop hanging out” with one another, emphasizing her sincerity with all-caps text and more exclamation points than a humanities teacher should ever use. The unwritten message was that in spending time with one another, my friends weren’t embracing the full college experience; time spent keeping in touch with old friends from high school was time not spent establishing new relationships within their respective universities throughout Boston. I sat idly as three of those friends chattered away at our reunion in a small burger restaurant in Davis Square. They told their stories as one, adding an anecdote about a person who was mentioned or bulking up a story with another version of the same happening. They had shared experiences, as students of city schools can. I was out of place with my isolated stories of Princeton. The smell of burgers settled into my hair as they babbled on. I couldn’t contribute to the stories of people everyone knew — I’ve had only brief encounters with the few students from my high school who are at Princeton — but I didn’t have any particularly thrilling stories about new friends and experiences to make up for it. It dawned upon me that in a single week, I had run into more friends in the city of Boston than I have made in the two months I’ve been at quaint little Princeton. I still don’t quite feel settled into my room in Bloomberg Hall, but it took me less than a week to feel at home in my boyfriend’s triple dorm room. As I set to work choosing which whimsically named burger to order, I wondered whether I was “doing college wrong.” Advice to incoming freshmen often includes some version of the notion that college is a fresh beginning, a departure from life in high school toward a greater world of academic and personal growth. Childhood memories and high school friends are great, but we have to move on. Holding on to what was means missing out on what is. I never imagined I would struggle to “move on” the way I have since I left home. In anticipation of my new, bound-to-be fabulous life at the extraordinary place that is Princeton, I packaged my memories of high school — friends, home, Tokyo — into a pretty hypothetical box and tucked it away into the far recesses of my consciousness. I was ready to face college head-on and determined to build a new life grander and more fulfilling than anything I had experienced before. But I couldn’t commit. I’ve been neither here nor there, neither fully engaged in my relationships and activities at Princeton nor committed to staying connected to my old friends. Every day I woke up convinced that today was the day I would start to be more present, more connected, and every day I went to bed resolved to do better tomorrow. I found myself in no man’s land, and until my visit to Boston, I didn’t realize that this awkward gray area I’ve found myself in is a construct of my own interpretation of how I should be “doing college.” “Moving on” implies letting go. It suggests that we leave something behind. In order to successfully move forward, we can’t ever look back. But how can we see how we’ve gotten to where we are if we don’t remember where we’ve been? We shouldn’t feel compelled to move on. It’s okay — better, even — for us to simply move along, following the current of experiences that then become memories. I had to see for myself how new friends can intermingle with old ones, how new experiences add to, rather than replace, old memories and how life isn’t a collection of disjointed stages dictated by how the educational institution is designed. As I lay in my boyfriend’s bed stuffed to the brim with burger and frozen yogurt, responding simultaneously to worried texts asking whether I made it safely past the post-World Series Championship craze on my way home and curious texts asking what everyone was up to over fall break, I had an epiphany: I had been wasting away what should have been the most stimulating two months of my life so far fixated on pursuing the “right” college experience, when really I should not have been worrying about that in the first place. “Doing college right” isn’t about the college experience itself; such a narrow focus undermines the worth of what we gain. It’s about discovering how that experience falls into place in the broader timeline of experiences throughout your life.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan.

47159|~|Is '12 Years a Slave' relevant? Probably|~|   November 4 2013|~|Column | Nov. 4 |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|During fall break, I saw Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a Slave” in one of the few theaters in the country where it was playing. I had read reviews praising the movie as a modern masterpiece. Many critics and fans regard it as the frontrunner for Best Picture. However, I was most interested in examining the historical relevance of the film. There have been many artistic explorations of slavery (e.g., Alex Haley’s “Roots” and Quentin Tarantino’s “Django Unchained,” among others). What would distinguish this film from any of its predecessors? “12 Years a Slave” is a beautifully crafted movie. McQueen’s third feature length is a skillful adaptation of the autobiography of Solomon Northup, a free man from New York who was kidnapped in 1841, sold into slavery and held in bondage for 12 years on Louisiania plantations. While it will please arthouse patrons with its soft color palettes, triumphant score and convincing performances, it is still a fundamentally brutal film that will incite pity, wrath and melancholia. I believed the film was worthy of an important discussion, but I could not decide why. After two days of reflection, I still could not articulate the entire range of my reactions. I was both pleased by the film’s masterful execution and discontented with its inability to express new ideas. I tried to understand what, if anything, I had learned from the experience. I concluded that the film’s success is not in its capacity to inform a nation about its shameful past (yes, slavery is bad — we know). Neither does the film explore a rich intellectual landscape that will challenge historical academicians. Indeed, the film emphasizes the familiar experiences of African-American slaves (I do, however, commend screenwriter John Ridley for including two under-represented historically-based character types: the white indentured servant and the black plantation mistress). But, the film’s success is contingent upon its emotive capacity. The fact that the film summons such visceral reactions and encourages the kind of reflectiveness that led me to write this article is a testament to its achievement. By virtue of its excellent craftsmanship, the film invites the audience to revisit it, thereby allowing the viewer to repeatedly experience emotional responses (horror, sympathy, hope) that are distinctly connected to the slavery narrative. In other words, the film is most valuable not because of its intellectual novelty, but because it successfully encourages the recollection of an important, scarred past. With this film, McQueen argues for the endurance of this particular narrative. He reminds us that humanity, though it tends to change its ethical and moral perspectives, is still capable of atrocious actions, just as it is still able to overcome them. There is a sort of timelessness to the slavery narrative because of its exceptional themes of debased repression and impossible persistence. The consequences of slavery were influential in Princeton’s history as well. In his essay, “Princeton and the Controversies Over Slavery,” University professor Sean Wilentz examines Princeton’s role in the antebellum debates between abolitionists and their opponents. As the intellectual center of the American Presbyterian Church, Princeton (then the College of New Jersey) was, by most standards, conservative in its stance on slavery. Wilentz notes that Princeton “was not so much proslavery as it was opposed to radical antislavery,” which became evident in the creation of the American Colonization Society, founded by Princeton graduate Robert Finley in 1816. The society sought to remove emancipated blacks to Africa, helping found the colony of Liberia. Given the severity of the slavery debate, it is interesting that in the 1850s, approximately one-sixth of Princeton’s population was black. Although racial relations were not always stable, white and black Presbyterians worshiped in the same building well into the nineteenth century. In 1840, however, black members of the First Presbyterian Church were relocated to a separate space. This community of expelled blacks would create Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church, which still stands as a symbol of both black solidarity and racial disunity. The release of “12 Years a Slave” in 2013 is not ill-timed. In our own environment, we can still see vestiges of the most contested debate in American history. I am not a film historian. I do not know the extent to which McQueen’s effort will endure. But even if we have been exposed to slavery narratives before, we have seen few that are as excellently composed as this one. And that, I think, is why McQueen created it. Regardless of the historical facts, this is a film about a real man’s emotional journey. McQueen draws this story from the well of history and reminds us that it is still there and always will be. Like the undeniable effects of slavery on current racial relations, we cannot ignore it. Nor should we. The act of remembrance is justifiable in itself because it validates our past and confirms the ethical transformations that have guided us to our present.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich.

47069|~|Memoirs from the Virginian wilds|~|   November 3 2013|~|Column | Nov. 3 |~|Ye Eun Charlotte Chun|~|None|~|He said that he’d been the best Latin reciter in his Ghanaian village before he took to the streets in Maryland. “I used to be a high school English teacher!” he said, pounding his chest proudly. “I liked poetry very much, and foreign languages. I could read Shake-uh-speare with a loud and strong voice, clear as the autumn sky.” He had come to Maryland 10 years ago to teach English with his brother, then had been laid off during the financial crisis. Since then, he’d taken to sleeping in Chinatown alleyways, picking up Mandarin Chinese along the way. The day we met, I was on a metro from one end of Maryland to the other, trying to reach Virginia on a spur-of-the-moment trip. When he first plopped down next to me, he said I looked pensive. Then he casually kicked up his legs and claimed that he rode the same train every day and saw many different people, even if they never saw anything more than a homeless man when they looked at him. But people are fascinating, he said. It’s incredible how much they miss by trying to just get from one place to another and not stopping to just revel in the feeling of existing. He then proceeded to pat me on the shoulder and quote Shelley before hopping off the train as suddenly as he’d gotten on. “After all, m’dear, if winter comes, can spring be far behind? Just take it one step at a time.” It was only then I realized I hadn’t even asked his name. Cliche movie moment, check. Before we move on, let me rewind. I’m an international student who has no close relatives in the United States and who, come fall break, realized the prospects of staying on campus seemed, quite honestly, miserable. I had been researching places to see autumn foliage for weeks and finally decided to board the first train to Virginia to solo-hike through Great Falls Park. It had started off as a trip to get away from the Orange Bubble and to see the glories of the Potomac; it ended up being a remarkable trip in every way more than just the destination. I boarded the 6 a.m. to Maryland, then took a metro from one end of the state to the other. Much to my dismay, I realized there were no cabs to take me to Great Falls Park from my stop in Virginia. After sitting hopelessly on the ground for 10 minutes, despising AT&T for its subpar service, a hay-truck driver stopped and asked if I needed a ride. Of course, as all rational people who care about their safety behave, I agreed. I distinctly remember the driver telling me while I was putting on my seatbelt, “I’m no creep, honey, but I guess that’s what all creeps would say.” This time, I got the name of my fellow traveler. His name was Doug, and he had never left Virginia in his entire life. He left at 7 a.m. every day to move hay from his farm to a business partner whom he met at the metro station, and he went home on the same route at the same time, every single day. People think they always need change, he said, that they always have to get out of the country and see something new. But what do they ever see more than some of those “new compyootun things”? He looked at me through the rearview mirror as he said this. “There isn’t much to the world, honey, there really isn’t.” Doug then proceeded to talk about his farm. I’m guilty of zoning out during most of his speech (there’s only so much excitement to how hay swirls), but it was still fascinating to hear how different Doug’s point of view was from Metro Man’s and how antithetical their lives were. One was always moving and traveling on paths unknown, and the other was always following the same route. However, both were equally happy with their lives and understood the world just as profoundly as the other. The Potomac itself was, of course, one of the most breathtaking views I’d seen. However, at the end of the day, I realized that travel isn’t so much about the place you intend to go or the place you leave behind, but returning home to see what you left behind in a completely new light. I learned more on this trip than books could ever teach me because I let my questionable judgment lead me to an experience beyond imagination. As Metro Man said, there are some pretty strange things that happen in the world; some things will thrill you and some will just freak you out (“like one of those Potato Head dolls”), but all you need to do is keep hopping off at stops that make you happy and jump right back on when you need to move on. Then, hopefully, there will be a cab awaiting you at the other end. Possibly.|~|Ye Eun Charlotte Chun is a sophomore from Seoul, South Korea.  She can be reached at ychun@princeton.edu. 
46953|~|On empathy|~|   November 3 2013|~|Column | Nov. 3 |~|Lauren Davis|~|   Columnist     |~|A few weeks ago, I got a C. The letter, scrawled in the corner and circled for emphasis, burned into my retinas the moment I flipped over the paper at the end of precept. A cocktail of emotions sizzled silently in the pit of my stomach as I packed my bag — frustration, anger, incredulity, insecurity — and I practically stomped out of the door like a two-year-old, mid-tantrum. Like most Princetonians, my self-worth remains a little too closely entwined with my GPA, despite my efforts to consciously pull the two apart. Receiving a bad grade still provokes a visceral response. As I left the building, I spotted my preceptor ahead of me on the side of the path, lighting up a cigarette. Still brimming with indignation, I thought it a good idea to march over there and give him a piece of my mind. I’m not proud of the possible, rather Shakespearian, conversation starters that ran through my head as I walked over, which ranged from the tersely outraged rant (how dare you disrespect me with this awful grade) to the guilt trip (I met with you before writing this paper and you told me I was on the right track, how could you stab me in the back like this). The preceptor looked up as I approached and said that I was surprised at my grade. He stumbled over his words slightly nervously when he began to reply, and I looked down to notice his hand shaking slightly behind the faint veil of cigarette smoke. The thought suddenly struck me that, though he was responsible for giving the grade, he didn’t deserve the unkindness I was about to unleash on him. Who knows what was going on his life — a life not all that many years ahead of my own — that had him smoking a cigarette at 10 a.m. Perhaps he’s stressed by his own work. Perhaps his dog just died, or his mother is sick. Perhaps, I realized, with a surge of sobering guilt, he is just a human being who didn’t deserve to take the full brunt of my irritation in that moment, even if he played some role in it. It can be far easier, but also less fair, to cast off unpleasant feelings onto others than to just let them go. Thankfully, this timely flash of empathy quelled my self-righteous impulse to lash out at the preceptor. I took a breath and asked if we could meet to talk about the paper at a later date. We both smiled, and I walked away. As I felt a surge of companionship and kindness toward my clearly overly-stressed preceptor, as one human being to another, the indignation about the C quickly faded into perspective. That angry, small-minded and selfish student is not the person I want to be, regardless of whether or not the grade I received was strictly “fair.” The academic environment is, by nature, full of criticism. We criticize to challenge ourselves and others, to improve ideas and, ideally, to improve our ability to think and make the world a better place. As high achieving students, most of us take our grades personally — probably more personally than is healthy — though it’s inevitable that the transcript we get will play some role in defining our future. But the pressures and expectations we feel don’t excuse us from behaving with basic empathy and kindness toward the professors and preceptors giving out those grades, the same way we would treat anyone else who is doing a job. In our everyday interactions and conversations among ourselves, as students, we tend to dehumanize our professors and preceptors. They hold power over us, so we adopt an “us versus them” mentality, inventing intentions or vendettas behind their assessments of our work that rarely exist. Far more common causes of unfair grades are human errors like tiredness or distraction; or maybe, we actually deserved that grade because we could do better. I’ve been babysitting for a professor this semester, and seeing him at home playing joyfully with his kids simply drives home the point that, though he may stand at the lecture podium and dictate standards in the academic system, he’s just a person. We all may have frustrations with the academic system from time to time, perhaps rightly so. Perhaps we may have legitimate feelings of blame when we are judged unfairly; but genuine ill will on the part of a preceptor, which is not excusable, is far less common than we make it out to be. Anger and negative emotions only serve to alienate us from others, whether it’s our friends, family or professors. The student perspective is, and has to be, very self-centered. We’re rightly concerned about our grades, our future and our performance. But the reality is that the world isn’t only about us. Everyone has their own struggles in the classroom and in the wider world. Perhaps we can all try to step into other people’s shoes before we act, to remind us of the baseline of kindness and respect that we would hope to receive were our situations switched.|~|Lauren Davis is a philosophy major from London, England.

46951|~|Editorial: Obama's college ranking plan|~|   November 3 2013|~|Editorial | Nov. 3 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|In August, President Obama announced plans to rate colleges based on their value and affordability and to tie those ratings to the federal grants students receive when attending colleges. The plan would eventually function so that students at higher-rated institutions would receive larger grants and more affordable loans. Pell Grants, which the federal government uses to disburse federal aid for colleges, totaled $34.5 billion to 9.4 million students in 2012. Many Pell Grant recipients use the federal money to go to schools that have low graduation rates and do not meaningfully improve outcomes even for those students who do graduate. For example, while applicants 25 and older receive 44 percent of Pell Grant money, only 3 percent earn a bachelor’s degree. Given the considerable waste produced by the current Pell Grant system, the Board supports the principles of Obama’s plan. We believe that it will encourage students to attend high value-added schools. In so doing, it will lead poor performing colleges to reform, dubious for-profit colleges to close and the government to spend more efficiently. At the same time, we worry that some students, who may be constrained in their college choices, would suffer as a result of this policy. In particular, students with constrained college choices may be hurt twice by this policy: Not only may they be compelled to attend poorly performing institutions because of a lack of meaningful choices, but they may now also receive lower funding because of their place of matriculation. Concerns also remain that the rankings system may give schools poor incentives when admitting students; if the ratings system ultimately incorporates graduation rates, it may incentivize schools to avoid admitting students that come from backgrounds that predict poor graduation rates. The rating system may also not be able to appropriately account for variation in backgrounds and experiences of students who attend different colleges, thus biasing its estimate of a college’s value-added. For example, it would be inappropriate to directly compare the graduation rates of schools that typically attract students whose parents attended college with students who are the first in their families to do so. Thus, while we believe Obama’s ratings plan would serve as an important informational source and would encourage students to attend effective schools, we urge caution in its application and stress that rating should never be mistaken for an absolute measure of value. Though flaws are probable and legitimate concerns exist, the bottom line is that the government does not have to create a perfect rating system to identify schools that serve as for-profit scams or do not produce value for their students. Based on Secretary of Education Arne Duncan’s recent explanation and modification of Obama’s proposal, the ratings system seems to be developing on an appropriate track. He stated that his goal is to develop a ratings rather than ranking system that compares schools within categories; in other words, schools with similar missions or population sizes would be compared, but not those that have vastly different fundamental characteristics. Duncan further outlined the goals: “We’ll be looking at access, such as the percentage of students receiving Pell Grants. We’ll be looking at affordability, like average tuition, scholarships and loan debt. And we’ll be looking at outcomes, such as graduation and transfer rates, alumni satisfaction surveys, graduate earnings and the advanced degrees of college graduates.”  Such a rating system would be a unique and beneficial contribution to the available higher education data, especially since the Department of Education would likely be able to gather more accurate data than private services. The Board believes this plan would represent a prudent step in encouraging reform among colleges, encouraging students to attend schools that will improve their lives and in disseminating information that will enable students to make informed choices when deciding where to matriculate. Currently, the higher education system in America is suffering from large cost increases and failures to give value to students. The Board thus welcomes this rating plan as an important measure to address these issues. ABSTAIN: Zach Horton|~|

46633|~|What we can't learn from MOOCs|~|   October 24 2013|~|Column | Oct. 24 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|It’s Friday. Midterms are over for all but the unluckiest. For a week we’ve been herding into lecture halls to take exams alongside hundreds of our peers, bonding over horrifying schedules and desperately waiting for break. Now it is upon us, and many leave campus and their friends for the week, knowing that all will still be there come November. Now imagine if it were not still here. After all, what use does a campus serve in the 21st century? We’re in the age of massive open online courses, when knowledge can be gained for free on the Internet. Forget the elitism of Ivy schools — all the college anyone could need is online! Not so fast. Despite the hype, the professors who teach MOOCs, as they are called, are less than enthusiastic about their potential for replacing traditional university education. A survey this spring in the Chronicle of Higher Education reveals an intriguing level of cynicism regarding the format. More than half of surveyed professors did not find the course they taught as rigorous as a comparable traditional course, and less than 30 percent thought that MOOC students should be given formal credit for their work. Clearly, something besides professors who think they’ve found an educational panacea are behind the enthusiasm. What is it? MOOCs can be seen, in a way, as an extension of what might be called the industrial model of education. When compulsory education began during the industrial revolution, the schools it created were modeled after the same industrial model as contemporary factories — teachers were the manufacturers, pounding out educated students in an assembly line, shifting them from one grade to the next until they’re sufficiently taught, then releasing them. This model has been pervasive in primary and secondary education — as our suite of quality-control standardized tests testify — and has moved into higher education as well, as large lectures replace the tutor-student relationships which were the standard since Socrates. The problem is, while books, films and other educational materials can be mass-produced, education itself cannot. Beyond introducing students to various essential facts, the most effective instructional method is engaging students on a personal level, responding to their individual needs and encouraging learning through collaborating to work out the concepts. I can be shown the derivation of the quadratic formula or the implicit theorem all I want, but it doesn’t mean anything until I work it out for myself, often outside of class with the insights and prodding of my peers and instructors. In remote education, collaborating is clunky and often infeasible, diminishing the value of the lecture. The same student density which allows us to share midterm gripes constantly also makes these very classes worth it. If interpersonal, collaborative education is effective in mathematical and scientific instruction, it’s essential to the liberal arts. While we can learn facts and skills from videos, it’s far harder to pick up critical thinking, a functional personal ethics system or civic engagement through videos. These, more than information exchange, are the goals of a college education and are hardly accomplished through coursework alone. Indeed, the value of our undergraduate experience stems as much from learning new modes of thinking and perspectives from our peers. Presenting mono-directional MOOCs as a replacement for college devalues the personal development essential to a university’s mission. Princeton recognizes this — outside of class, we have plenty occasion to learn, from famous speakers and each other, and within courses, discussing and challenging ideas is the basis of the preceptorial system. However much we complain about precept, it’s hard to argue that a system basically consisting of massive lectures alone would work better. As a one-way exchange of information, lectures — and the MOOCs modeled after them — may as well be modern textbooks. And here we see the proper role of MOOCs in modern education. These lectures and the accompanying materials can be invaluable for those outside of a college environment or as a substitution for a textbook within, but will never replace a well-built course’s collaborative component. Their rich presentation of information, ability to communicate with the professor-author in real time and low cost of distribution make them ideal, however, for replacing the expensive, dry and heavy piles of paper we all know and hate. In her column last month, Lauren Davis suggested we try out a “flipped” lecture system, wherein students watch MOOC-type lecture material on their own time and discuss or apply it in class, and indeed several courses, including COS 226: Algorithms and Data Structures, have begun experimenting with this format. In theory, this allows instructor resources to be focused on the most important part of learning — the synthesis and application of the material. Remote learning, by very nature of being remote and therefore decreasing the influence of the campus as a community, cannot provide a well-rounded college education to all. So as we integrate technology into the lecture hall, we must not lean on MOOCs as our only way of opening access. They can provide knowledge to students around the world, but it is only through initiatives to ensure that bright students everywhere have access to college that we can provide equal access to that far more important resource, education.|~|
46630|~|Editorial: Restructure midterms|~|   October 24 2013|~|Editorial | Oct. 24 |~|Daily Princetonian Editorial Board|~|   Staff     |~|As exams come to a close and many of us head off campus for fall break, the Board would like to take the opportunity to reflect on the structure of this chaotic week that we call midterms. Midterms week is unique, as students carry the burden of exams along with their regular course loads. Currently, there are few policies in place that regulate how midterm exams are scheduled and administered. With a few simple changes, midterms would be more standardized and thus fairer for all students. The first issue with midterms concerns take-home exams. The Board recognizes that there can be limited time to administer in-class exams during midterms week; this makes take-homes necessary in some cases. However, take-home exams lead to both increased opportunities and increased temptation for students to cheat. Because students are not in a classroom surrounded by peers, they may hold themselves less accountable, and there will be no one else present to ensure their academic integrity. As a result, if take-home exams are not administered properly, they penalize students who adhere to the University’s academic policies. Two important changes can be made to help remedy this issue: Closed note take-homes should be disallowed, and time-limited take-homes should be timed in a reliable manner. Closed note take-homes provide a unique temptation for students to cheat. In a classroom setting, students are less likely to cheat because there is both an implicit and explicit pressure to act honestly when there are other students in the room. But if a student is in his or her room alone, struggling with a take-home, and the textbook is mere inches away, it is easy to imagine how some might slip up and take a peek. If several students in a class cheat, those that do not are at a significant disadvantage in terms of grading, especially given the steep grading curves in many classes. Timed take-homes also incentivize cheating. In a classroom setting, it is obvious if a student is writing after the time is called. But again, if students are alone and just want to finish up a paragraph or two, it is easy to imagine them writing beyond the allotted time. There are several systems that can be used to check timing on such exams. One option is administering exams through Blackboard, which has a system that electronically times student exams. Another option is having students physically pick up and return exams at designated times. If professors do not wish to utilize these methods, they can simply opt to assign non-timed take-home exams or in-class exams. The Board also believes that there should be a standardized policy for rescheduling midterms. Unlike final exams, with midterms, professors have the power to move an exam for students who request a change due to a particularly heavy exam schedule. This leads to unfairness, as some professors may be more willing than others to make exceptions. For final exams, the Registrar outlines a concrete policy by which students can move exams: If they have more than one in a 24-hour period, they are eligible for a change. For midterms, the Board proposes a similar policy. Because midterm exams are generally shorter and occur over a shorter time period, the Board feels that it would be appropriate to allow students to reschedule an exam if they have more than two exams in a 24-hour period. Standardizing this policy would both make exam rescheduling easier and would ensure fairness across classes. Midterms week is one of the most stressful times of the year. The Board believes that these changes would help make this week both fairer and more manageable.|~|
46663|~|Keep calm, we don't conform|~|   October 24 2013|~|Column | Oct. 24 |~|Prianka Misra|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|I am done with people calling me an investment banker. It is time for an intervention. Mitchell Hammer’s recent article, “Keep Calm and Conform On,” seems to have this label in mind for me and many of my peers at this University. Hammer presents an interesting and compelling argument, stating that students at the University conform too much to greater societal norms. We don’t stand out in the hordes of other young people hungry for opportunities and impassioned with creative energy. Princeton students are blase. We simply carry on with the status quo, pursuing our banking jobs and the serene, well-traveled routes to future employment opportunities. Sure, many Wilson School majors (and those pursuing a plethora of other majors, mind you) seek careers on Wall Street. I am not one of them. I don’t know whether I want to go into law, journalism, public policy, business or something else. Hammer brings up the fact that students at the University don’t look very different from one another. He comments on the lack of a strong presence of students with unconventional and visible tattoos, dyed hair or unique piercings. While I can understand his perspective here, I think that he has to look harder. Many Princeton students may have these attributes and choose not to flaunt them. This could be due to personal preferences or perhaps a general campus-wide trend, but I highly doubt that the eclectic student body at Princeton would judge someone severely for having such an image. Besides, I don’t think that choosing not to show off your tattoo has much to do with conformity on the whole. I don’t equate preferences with beliefs, so I don’t think that choosing not to have a tattoo or preferring to hide one from the rest of campus says anything about the rigidity of your moral or intellectual fiber. More importantly, I don’t think that not having purple hair or a piercing shows that you are any less original than someone who has both of these things. To me, conforming is about subverting and silencing your beliefs because those of others are too loud to accommodate your own. I think it’s safe to say that most Princeton students aren’t afraid to speak their minds. They are intellectual non-conformists, and they pursue myriad opportunities that are “out of the box,” not just the ones that will yield a job on Wall Street. When I first came to Princeton, I didn’t think I would be unique. I was (and possibly am) just your average Indian-American girl. I performed classical Indian dance and played the piano. I loved Indian food and Bollywood music, but when it came to hanging out with school friends, I was really into uniquely Californian food and the best top 100 songs. I was perhaps only different in the sense that I was choosing to study international relations as opposed to giving in to gentle, habitual pre-med coaxes and not-so-subtle hints administered by my parents. But when I came to Princeton, I realized how different I really was: I had traveled to five of seven continents, performed at international choral venues, written for a renowned newspaper and been interviewed for one of my pieces. All of these things added color to my story, which then fused into a vibrant spectrum when I encountered other Princeton students who had engaged in meaningful experiences without banking in mind. I found that my story, when set into motion and dialogue with the stories of others, wove into an intricate fabric that couldn’t be replicated. I met people who had been to Ghana for a gap year, who were working on documentaries in Varanasi, India, who had met the President of the United States, who had won awards for scientific innovations, who had started ventures and organizations in every corner of the world. And although you can’t exactly equate uniqueness with nonconformity, it’s safe to say that these people stretched themselves beyond the status quo, choosing to address the issues and engage the populations that were most important to them. These people didn’t just have future employment in mind — they wanted to better themselves and engage in their communities as well. People at Princeton may not be “different” in the most obvious ways. But I would encourage everyone to look deeper and find the facets that make each student here unconventional. To some extent, Hammer is correct. Our visual conformity is undeniable — the crew neck sweaters and jittery interview suits unite large swaths of our student body. But that doesn’t mean that we conform intellectually, ideologically or philosophically. To find the real nonconformists in the student body, you’ll have to start a conversation.  |~|Prianka Misra is a sophomore from Castro Valley, Calif. She can be reached at pmisra@princeton.edu. 
46445|~|A response to "What Is Marriage?"|~|   October 22 2013|~|Column | Oct. 22 |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Last Thursday evening, I found myself in McCosh 50 for a talk delivered by Ryan Anderson ’04, called “What Is Marriage?” The fact that it was sponsored by the Anscombe Society — a campus group dedicated to promoting traditional marriage roles, family and chastity — gave me a pretty strong inkling of what wouldn’t be included in his definition. The gay marriage debate is ages old at this point. On a college campus, it’s pretty difficult to oppose same-sex marriage in peace. Especially in such a liberal part of the United States, being homophobic like that is just about equivalent to being racist. What interested me in Anderson’s talk, however, was that he claimed he would make a case for the “traditional definition” of marriage without calling upon religion reasoning, vague moral loftiness or historical precedent. He said he’d use purely “philosophical reasoning.” It turns out that “philosophical reasoning” was just a generic slippery slope argument. If we change one variable in the supposedly very complicated definition of marriage (his, by the way, consisted of three parts: a man and a woman creating a nurturing environment for children, doing this with sexual exclusivity and doing this forever), it could lead to changing every variable. What’s to stop it from changing two people of any sex to three people of any sex? What’s to stop it from becoming four people of any sex? What’s to stop marriage from being a temporary “wed-lease” — no expectation of forever at all? The main problem with the slippery slope argument is that marriage law has already changed tons of times, within the last hundred years alone. Fifty years ago, marriage law disallowed interracial unions. Even before that, it dictated that a woman, after marriage, would become the husband’s property. Clearly, we’ve amended the law several times already, and anarchy has not yet broken loose. Someone in the audience did mention interracial marriage in the Q&A session, and Anderson responded by saying that the old writings of Aristotle and Plato never indicated that marriage had to be between two people of the same race, so therefore it was okay. I found this response startling for several reasons. First of all, it broke the rule that Anderson set for himself that he wouldn’t call upon historical precedent. Second, if Aristotle and Plato had indeed had racist tendencies in their writings from thousands of years ago, would that make a solid case against interracial marriage now? Furthermore, what even makes them any sort of authority on the matter of marriage? Plato wasn’t even married, and Aristotle said in “Politics” that women were “subject to men, but higher than slaves.” Anderson pointed to polyamory as the seemingly catch-all bleak dystopia that the world would be headed to once we legalize same-sex marriage. Many defenders of traditional marriage law seem to think this too. What’s surprising, though, is that even people who believe in marriage equality seem to agree that polygamy would be an unwanted consequence. The thing is, I don’t think polygamy and polyamory are huge deals either. It’s no one else’s business, certainly not the government’s, what a certain person’s definition of love is. What does matter is that the institution is offered to all members of society equally. The main argument against polygamy by skeptics is that it never works out, many citing Psychology Today’s claim that people are just fundamentally too jealous. However, with 50 percent of all weddings ending in divorce, it’s arguable that marriage in general just doesn’t work out. No one’s proposing to illegalize marriage because it doesn’t seem to work out. According to a recent study based on U.S. Census data, bartenders have one of the highest divorce rates among all professions, yet no one’s trying to make sure that they never get married. Apart from his slippery slope argument, Anderson made the claim that marriages are all about children and that single-parent households and same-sex marriages produce the “worst environment” for children. He cited a few social science studies to back this up but was very unclear on what “worst environment” even means. Furthermore, as he conceded later in the Q&A session, social science studies are very difficult to control. Two studies about the same subjects can reach polar-opposite conclusions based only on the type of data they report. And if both single-parent households and same-sex households scored equally “bad” in terms of rearing children, what’s the legal justification for allowing one but banning the other? I came to Anderson’s talk expecting a well-articulated argument with which I would have to respectfully disagree. I was a little sad that what I heard was a rather shoddy one. Slippery-slope arguments and poorly controlled social science experiments aren’t a proper platform on which to deny one-tenth of the American population equal rights.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

46449|~|Finance or bust|~|   October 22 2013|~|Column | Oct. 22 |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|Several times a week, my inbox is flooded with emails from TigerTracks about new opportunities in consulting, trading and investment banking. At first I thought that maybe I had made a mistake when I filled out my profile. Did I accidentally click “computer science” instead of “comparative literature” when I clicked on the drop-down box to list my major? Perhaps I clicked on one of the check-boxes for “consulting” when I really meant to click “communications/media” as one of my career preferences. But when I looked at my profile, I had made no errors. So why was I receiving emails that did not pertain to my interests? After expressing my opinions to friends, I realized that I wasn’t the only one who felt a little bit peeved about these emails. According to PolicyMic, in 2011 about 35 percent of Princeton students went into finance, which proves that the industry is booming.  The top investment banking companies come to Princeton and Harvard first to recruit students, and these emails are used to spread the word in order to prepare for the early recruitment and interviewing process. And I’m not suggesting that no one in the humanities goes into these types of job sectors. They do. But when I rarely see email alerts about arts companies, I cannot help but wonder if I, and many others who made sure to detail their preferences on TigerTracks, are being ignored. As mentioned earlier, I understand that the recruitment process for finance companies starts very early in the year. Students dress in their best professional attire and head to Frist 302 to hear from employers, chat with them afterward and eat good food. Career Services tries to create a balance with these events; for example, they organize the annual Communications Careers & Networking Night. Looking at the description for the event, it is noted that these types of companies do not often recruit on campus. But why not? Those handling TigerTracks should count the students whose interests include the arts, editorials, writing, et cetera, so that they can use these statistics to attract companies from these particular job sectors to come to campus in order to recruit people. If Career Services targets students who participate in the Nassau Literary Review, the Nassau Weekly, The Daily Princetonian, creative writing classes and the countless theater groups, I can almost guarantee that you will find enough students to fill Dillon Gymnasium for a career fair that is specifically aimed at those who are interested in the arts. This will encourage companies from these sectors to network more with students. The demand is already there. The Freelance Artist’s Manifesto Boot Camp is another excellent example of an initiative hosted by Theatre Intime for those who are artistically inclined. But what about those artists who do not want to be freelance?  There are countless ways in which an artistic person can channel his or her skills, both in traditional and unconventional paths. For instance, NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts or the University of Iowa’s Writers’ Workshop could hold information sessions here. These options do exist, but we need access to them. I have noticed that there are a few companies, such as those in translation, with deadlines that passed a few short days ago. What if reminders were sent about those opportunities? Since foreign language study is required for two years at Princeton and there are plenty of students who go beyond the requirement, these types of students should be catered to as well. Do you know how many Princetonians speak French? Searching for jobs is a stressful topic for all seniors, but the process would be less overwhelming with balanced support from Career Services. Yes, finance students should be especially cognizant of deadlines and information sessions because the recruitment processes are early and tend to finish rather quickly. That doesn’t mean that the entire student community should be flooded with these emails, especially when we have never listed these career preferences. Instead, those who tend to fall on the artistic side should be informed and reminded about upcoming deadlines for other companies. Check out BuzzFeed (which was started by a Princeton alumnus, might I add) — there is a job opening this instant as a books editor. Many Princeton students on Facebook are constantly tuned into these websites. If Career Services could consolidate some of this information and send emails, perhaps others like me wouldn’t feel so left out.|~|Morgan Jerkins is a comparative literature major from Williamstown, N.J.

46458|~|Getting help with fitting in|~|   October 22 2013|~|Column | Oct. 22 |~|Susannah Sharpless|~|None|~|When you join an eating club (if you join an eating club), a weird thing happens: You become the baby again. Though you’re basically halfway though your undergraduate career — if you keep churning smoothly through the system like the rule-abider you are — and a legal adult, you suddenly find yourself infantilized. The older members beam at you and tell you how to bus your plate. When you show up for meals alone, you feel intimidated, awkward. You wander wide-eyed through unfamiliar halls, feeling once more that overwhelming newness you haven’t felt since freshman fall. Aaron Applbaum ’14 recently wrote about his wish for more cohesion among the student body, and I agree with him, but I would like to emphasize a different negative effect of the eating-club-induced bifurcation between upper- and underclassmen. He is right to worry about lost opportunities for friendship and growth. I think, also, that this separation between younger and older students robs us of a chance to help each other. I think we all remember how scary Princeton can be when you don’t know what on earth is going on. This is a school of strange lingo and unspoken rules. From “proxes” to passes, to the twin McCoshes, to what it means to be “picked up” or “hosed,” feeling comfortable here is as much about speaking the language as it is about figuring out where you “fit.” The other day, a friend of mine fumed about the way a freshman had asked her for a pass. She and I, as freshmen, had been terrified into simpering timidity by socially powerful upperclassmen because we were susceptible to social pressure and easily swayed by group cohesion. Admittedly, this freshman had been relatively rude, but how could he possibly have known better? My understanding of how to fit into this campus was formed both because and in spite of the sorority I belonged to for a year-and-a-half. I joined as a freshman because I was totally confused by Princeton and rushing was the easiest way to work my way into a campus social scene I barely even knew existed, let alone understood. The girls I met during rush were friendly, tall and blonde, a lot of them were English majors, and I thought I saw some incarnation of what I’d like to be in them. It was shallow, but I was sold. Though I eventually turned out not to be an English major and definitely not to be a sorority girl, I never could have evolved past who I was then, and what I understood Princeton to be, had I not had this community in the first place. Given the circumstances, it was the best I could do. I’m pretty against Greek life in general these days, but I can’t fault anyone for wishing for this kind of network to decipher the complexities of the first months and years here. It’s true that there are a variety of ways for underclassmen to find this kind of guidance within the older echelons of this campus community, but these are highly specific, often aimed at a certain demographic and mainly academic. I don’t know if they work or not. I know the peer adviser I had freshman year (was I supposed to have one sophomore year, too?) was unhelpful — and besides, I knew what I wanted to study. What I needed were upperclassman connections I could ask for more than just a pass. I don’t have an exact solution. I do know that efforts last spring to make me feel at home in my eating club worked: I love it there now. This fall, watching freshmen — my younger sister among them — adjust to this campus makes me wonder whether us upperclassmen could do something like this, though I’m not exactly sure what it would be, for the actual new kids on the block, the real babies. Last month, as my newsfeed filled with pictures of newly Greek sophomores hugging smiling juniors, all in their letters, I felt something like envy underneath my scorn. I wanted that: to get to know the people the dining halls I’m never in and tell them that if they mix Sriracha with Fines Herbes Dressing it’s actually delicious. I’d like to let the underclassmen cramming in my old study room in on the secret that the walls are thinner than they realize, so they shouldn’t sing along to their 2 a.m. pump-up song, and to remind whomever’s in my old room in Yoseloff that everyone can see what they’re up to from the courtyard. Well, everyone who’s down there, at least. Which isn’t me, anymore.|~|Susannah Sharpless is a religion major from Indianapolis, Ind. She can be reached at ssharple@princeton.edu.

46151|~|Look up|~|   October 20 2013|~|Column | Oct. 20 |~|Daniel Xu|~|None|~|People don’t look up. I’ve proved it to myself a number of times. On one occasion during my sophomore year, after climbing to the top of Dillon Gymnasium, I spotted a friend of mine walking past me toward Spelman Halls and the Wa. I called out to him and, hiding behind a gargoyle, observed with terrific glee that he skidded to a halt and immediately turned to look behind him. He looked to his left and to his right, and then, curiously, into his messenger bag, before scratching his head and continuing on his way. He did not look up. We certainly don’t take issue with looking down. When I was a child, plane rides were just the most exciting thing. I used to argue with my little brother over who got to sit next to the window, even though we were small enough then to be able to press both of our heads against the glass. We watched as we rose higher and higher until the cars and trucks on the highway began to look like the ants that swarmed out of the hills we stomped on at recess. Here was the vastness of the Earth, shrunk to a size that I could understand and absorb within the myopia of my worldview. I’ll admit that whenever I’m on a plane, I still like to look through the glass at the world below. And I still find it pretty neat that nobody down there would ever think to look back up at me if it weren’t for the noise of the jet engines. There is a place near my hometown where the murky turquoise waves of a TVA-commissioned lake meet the base of a brown rock formation rising 50 feet into the air to form cliffs overlooking the water. These cliffs are a popular gathering spot for young people during the warmer seasons, who drive from miles around to hurl themselves like lemmings off the ledges and land, whooping and hollering, in the lake below. This past summer, my high school friends and I gathered together in our hometown to return to the lakeside cliffs before the start of our senior years. We drove along the derelict country road and wandered through the bush to arrive at the top of the rocks, just before the sun set. We met a shirtless, tattooed young man who asked us for a cigarette lighter, because he’d gotten a bit drunk and thrown his off the cliff. When we came up empty, he consented to sit down beside us to talk for a while. A car enthusiast with a particular fondness for Japanese domestic market vehicles, he shared his dream of one day going to Tokyo to check out the street-racing scene there. “You know, like that movie ‘Tokyo Drift.’ None of y’all happen to be Japanese, do you?” he asked hopefully. We told him we were sorry to disappoint. “Man, I’d really like to go,” he sighed. Then he jumped from the highest cliff. A sense of mounting terror crept over me as the minutes passed and he did not resurface. My friends dove in to search for him while I stayed ashore to dial 911. We left after the cops came with their speedboats and searchlights. I would read in the news the next morning about the body of a drowned man discovered underneath the rocks where he’d jumped the evening before. I stayed up that night and many nights after wondering what had kept him from just skipping town and going to Japan. Wondering what kept anyone from just pushing aside the things that get in the way of what they really want from life. Maybe he hadn’t saved the money. Maybe there were things he needed to take care of first. Maybe he thought he’d have plenty of time to get around to it, eventually. We Princetonians are ambitious, driven young people. We have incredible plans for our futures, and if we don’t have plans, we have dreams, and if we don’t have dreams, we have vague suspicions. But there are times, with so many aspirations packed so tightly into one small Orange Bubble, that working to meet those great expectations can feel like fighting just to stay afloat. And sometimes we get the feeling that where we’re headed isn’t where we’d really like to go — that what we’re working for isn’t really what we want. But we tell ourselves that we’ll have plenty of time to get around to chasing those dreams when we’re older, when we’re more secure — when we’ve made it. People don’t look up, not when our eyes are fixed so firmly on the ground we have yet to cover. But maybe, just once in a while, we should.|~|Daniel Xu is a molecular biology major from Knoxville, Tenn. He can be reached at dcxu@princeton.edu. 
46222|~|Big fish, bruised egos|~|   October 20 2013|~|Column | Oct. 21 |~|Tehila Wenger|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Big fish from a little pond comes to Princeton. It’s an old cliche, one painfully familiar to many undergraduates who are in theory excited to dive into a rigorous intellectual environment but not quite prepared for the reality. Many who can’t wait to engage with intellectual equals are soon crushed by the realization that some of these “equals” leave them far behind in terms of brainpower. The caliber of classes and peers may provide an intellectual feast for a few students who are particularly grateful to have escaped the ennui of unchallenging high schools, but for others, the prospect of no longer being the smartest person in the room is terrifying. In academic forums, this reaction often translates into a tone of apology or self-effacement. Students enter each new precept gingerly, qualifying their most interesting and controversial offerings with that sterile little addendum of, “I feel like,” or “I think,” then recoiling in shock if a classmate is ill-bred enough to challenge the comment. Two years ago, Princeton commissioned a report of the Steering Committee on Undergraduate Women’s Leadership, also known as the Keohane Report. Although the report highlights the tendency of women to underrate their mental powers more than their male counterparts, the disparity is qualified by the finding that “over the course of their careers, both men and women lower their self-assessments about intellectual self-confidence.” This is one of the many things they don’t tell you on Orange Key tours: Princeton turns out humbler students. There’s nothing wrong with a little humility. I can think of more than one classmate who could use a larger dose of it. These are presumably the outliers in the Keohane study; the University environment has done nothing whatsoever to affect their good opinions of themselves. Overall, however, when students who are accustomed to academic domination suddenly find themselves in a position of intellectual mediocrity, the development of humility is complemented by painful feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. These character traits don’t have to go hand-in-hand. Humility implies the capacity to be honest with one’s self about limitations and weaknesses. Insecurity is the opposite — there’s no opportunity for honesty when you’re plagued by neurotic uncertainty about your own worth. I have yet to meet a stupid Princeton student. I do know many who are technologically, mathematically or literarily challenged. Just the other day, one of my friends announced over breakfast that he found “Middlemarch,” the darling of all 19th-century lit scholars for its unparalleled insights into human relations, a painful read because “nothing happens.” This student is one of the most interesting, sharply analytical thinkers of my acquaintance, and my general estimation of his intelligence is not in the least weakened by his obtuse approach to Victorian literature. I even admire his unapologetic dismissal of George Eliot. To me, he’s a tone-deaf concert-goer critiquing a masterpiece, but he’s more interesting to talk to after the show than an appreciative listener who doesn’t trust herself to pass judgment. Princeton students have strengths and weaknesses in different areas, but we tend to overemphasize our weaknesses and play down our strengths. I am currently battling a two-year-old mental block that causes my brain to switch off as soon as I hear words with mathematical connotations: “integral,” “derivative” and “logarithmic function” all have the power to send a shiver of fear down my spine. The strange thing is that in high school, I was a decent math student. As a college freshman, I quickly dropped out of MAT 104: Calculus II and developed an allergic reaction to anything containing numbers. My confidence in my own math skills is currently at an all-time low. This is a self-inflicted state of mind, a way of sidestepping intellectual expectations by buying into the myth about a left-right brain dichotomy. It is easier for me to invent a mental handicap for myself than to engage with a subject I find particularly challenging, especially one that puts me on such unequal ground relative to my math-oriented friends. At the end of the day, my mathematical ineptitude is a pretense and a cop-out. We need to stop selling ourselves short in our own minds and discourse. In terms of the size of the fish and the pond, we haven’t shrunk just because our borders have expanded. True, some of our peers outshine us in the very subjects we used to dominate, but that’s no reason to pretend to be smaller than we are. Swallow the humble pie, but don’t fall into the easy trap of doubting and devaluing yourself beyond what the situation calls for. Our time is better spent trying to grow bigger.|~|Tehila Wenger is a politics major from Columbus, Ohio. She can be reached at twenger@princeton.edu. 
46215|~|Editorial: Expand ESL offerings|~|   October 20 2013|~|Editorial | Oct. 20 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Among the difficulties freshmen face when they first arrive at Princeton is meeting Princeton’s high standard for academic writing. Though we understand that Princeton’s mandatory writing seminars aim to prepare all students for this increased rigor, the Board believes that the University should provide more resources for those students who have learned English as a second language in order to help them meet this rigorous expectation. The University’s application process aims to ensure that students who matriculate here are well-equipped to complete essays in English. Excluding those who attend an English-language school, applicants who are non-native speakers of English and who did not attend an English-speaking high school must demonstrate their English proficiency by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language as well as the SAT or ACT plus writing. However, critics of the TOEFL argue that the test fails to evaluate a student’s ability to construct a complex argument in English, which is an imperative skill for academic writing here. Of course, not all non-native English speakers at Princeton struggle with constructing complex arguments in their essays, and the writing seminars bolster the argumentative writing abilities of all freshmen. However, ESL students face the intrinsic challenge of a language barrier, which makes it especially difficult to produce high-quality academic writing. Princeton already addresses this barrier for graduate students by providing the graduate population with many ESL resources. The Friends of Davis International Center sponsors multiple levels of English language classes tailored to international graduate students. With group and individual classes and tutoring, the center provides ample opportunities for graduates students who need ESL learning assistance. Moreover, the McGraw Center offers its English Language Program, a comprehensive program tailored toward oral skills. These and other opportunities are valuable resources, but many of them are unfortunately limited to or tailored for graduate students. Thus, the Board hopes that the University will adapt some of these resources and tailor them toward the undergraduate population. Many of the opportunities already provided for graduates students would need little change content-wise but are held at inconvenient times or locations for undergraduates; adjusting these two parameters would easily attract undergraduates. Moreover, those resources that are specifically targeted to graduate students as a matter of policy, such as McGraw’s English Language Program, should be made accessible to undergraduates. Moreover, the Writing Center could expand its services to also include specific appointments for students who would like to focus on their ESL issues. Students could be able to request these sessions separately online, and these sessions would involve writing fellows who specialize in assisting ESL students and who could focus on the unique challenges that such students face. The Board recognizes that such an offering would currently fall outside of the Writing Center’s purview, as its current sessions aim to help students with the writing process and such larger issues as argument construction and organization. However, we believe that offering services to ESL students would be a worthy extension of the Writing Center’s services. Princeton should be taking steps to help non-native English-speaking students succeed at Princeton. Though Princeton does seek to ensure that all undergraduates have sufficient grasp of the English language by evaluating TOEFL results, this practice certainly does not guarantee that all undergraduates will face no language barrier. Simply expanding current graduate offerings or the Writing Center’s services would allow some international students to be more academically successful at Princeton. Because Princeton has an interest in the academic growth of all its students, the Board urges the University to expand its ESL offerings.|~|
46152|~|Letter to the Editor: Anscombe supports (media) equality|~|   October 20 2013|~|Letter to the Editor | Oct. 20 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|Regarding “PEP supports equality at marriage talk” (Thursday, Oct. 17, 2013) The Anscombe Society would like to thank Regina Wang for her well-balanced piece covering our event last Thursday with Ryan T. Anderson ’04 speaking about marriage. We believe, however, that the editors of The Daily Princetonian did a poor job of respecting Wang’s balanced news coverage in the framing of her story. Unfortunately, the print edition’s headline following Anderson’s lecture misleadingly read, “PEP Supports Equality at Marriage Talk.” Had the editors paid any attention to the event itself, they would have known that Anderson observed up front that both sides of the marriage debate are in favor of marriage equality — contingent upon what marriage itself is defined to be. The headline pushed through by the editors of the ‘Prince’ was the mark of a biased editorial staff. Further proof of this lies in the discrepancy between the headlines of the online and print editions. Online, the Anderson article has the much more balanced title, “With demonstrators in the audience, Heritage Foundation fellow Anderson ’04 urges traditional understanding of marriage.” This headline was released soon after Anderson’s lecture, and the discrepancy between this balanced title and the biased print version reveals a conscious editorial decision to manipulate the coverage. This poor framing of an otherwise generally well-written story should come as an embarrassment to the ‘Prince.’ We hope to see better editorial decisions in the future.|~|Ben Koons ’15 and Christian Say ’16 President and Vice President of the Anscombe Society

45863|~|Class divisions|~|   October 17 2013|~|Column | Oct. 17 |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|The senior class council wisely saved up its social funds for a series of events called “Pub Nights.” The point of these evenings is to rent out a bar such that it  exclusively serves the Princeton senior class, so that anyone from the class can participate. The recent event at Triumph Brewing Company was remarkably enjoyable given the social nature of the affair and the unlimited and free nature of the beer. One aspect stuck out in particular, though. There are so many students in the Class of 2014 I had never met before. There were many students whom I had never even seen before. I am into my fourth year at this institution, and I still hadn’t met a notable quantity of my comrades. At Princeton the likelihood that any given student is interesting and engaging is very high, and the likelihood that they can teach you something new is even higher. It dawned on me that I had a real fear growing inside of me: that I would graduate from Princeton and never meet all of these potentially wonderful and engaging people. And of course that fate is inevitable. I understand that one cannot know, or even meet, 1,200 some-odd students, no matter how socially ubiquitous one is. However, I figured it ought to become a priority of mine to try. After realizing how many of 2014-ers I had yet to meet, I recognized that there are four such classes on this campus at every given moment. Naturally I know fewer and fewer students from each of the respective younger classes, knowing hardly a handful of freshmen. I know my class to be composed of smart, engaging and diverse people; surely every other grade mirrors this reality. My fear grew. I would leave Princeton knowing such a small minority of such a talented campus. But what scared me was not that I wouldn’t meet everyone (that is silly), but more so that I wouldn’t meet much of anyone. What mechanism is in place for seniors to meet and befriend freshmen (and the other grades as well)? The entire student body shares nights out on the Street, but in my experience that is not the place to build new and diverse friendships. There are a few outlets for older students to befriend younger ones. All activity clubs recruit freshmen into their ranks. Eating clubs will welcome in new hoards of sophomores in the spring, and classes are usually not segregated by year. All of these outlets, however, are limited. A music group will increase its membership only by a few lucky souls, and eating clubs, while creating some interaction between upperclassmen and underclassmen, do so only for a limited number of students. If I have learned anything from attending Princeton Reunions, it is that class year is arbitrary, and the intergenerational comingling of Tigers is part of the institution’s very fabric. Current students get to meet alumni; young alumni get to meet the older ones. The four-year gap that separated the veteran seniors from the rookie freshmen just about dissolves upon graduation. As four becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of our total life lived, the time difference matters less and less. It is of course true that most seniors are in many ways more mature, savvy and comfortable than most freshmen, and friendships between the two camps are not the most natural thing. But Princeton students learn quickly, and frosh soon grow into themselves and so are increasingly worth getting to know (as  they are even in their yet underdeveloped forms). The increased interaction between freshmen and seniors can be mutually beneficial beyond the fact that more people will meet each other. Freshmen can learn from the experiences of the seniors and avoid more potential pitfalls, and the seniors can be reminded of the eagerness and simple joy of attending Princeton. I am not advocating for a formal mentoring program, just the ability for people of different ages to learn from each other in an organic and friendly way. There ought to be a way for the University to increase the senior-to-freshman (read: underclassmen) interaction. The University does provide upperclassmen with two dining hall meals a week, but these are either not spent or used to dine in the company of other upperclassmen. The younger generation should not bear the burden of introducing themselves — that is understandably daunting. I believe the residential college system is the way to facilitate the mingling of upper and lower classes. Every upperclassman has belonged to one, and most people have an affinity toward their college and perhaps some spillover affinity for the new people in it. I would have called a senior-freshman event hosted by Wilson silly, that is, before recognizing what a tragic loss it would be to graduate from Princeton and not know such a vast number of its young talented students and potential lifelong friends.|~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif.  He can be reached at applbaum@princeton.edu. 
45837|~|Editorial: Emergency action plan|~|   October 17 2013|~|Editorial | Oct. 17 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Last week’s false alarm regarding a reported shooting incident on campus came just months after reports of a bomb on campus during the summer. Both events were covered extensively by the media on and off campus, and though the Board commends the Department of Public Safety and the Princeton Police Department for their thorough response to the incidents, we believe the University can take action to better inform students on how to respond to and stay safe during emergencies. Specifically, the Board believes that the University should more publicly disseminate a detailed action plan concerning appropriate action after a suspected shooting or bomb threat. During the recent suspected shooting, many students were caught off guard by the situation and were unaware of what steps to take. In order to alert students to possible dangers as rapidly as possible, the campus alert system provides only the sparsest information. Though this was successful at making the student body aware of possible danger, it provided limited directions about what steps students should take. Throughout the school year, students participate in fire drills to ensure that all students understand the protocol in case of such an emergency. While drills for either a bomb or shooting threat are likely unnecessary given the disparity in legal requirements and likelihood of incidence, Princeton could take other steps to improve its response to campus emergencies. Currently, Public Safety has guidelines available online on how to deal with a variety of emergencies, but these guidelines generally lack detailed information concerning how the University community should respond to occurrences such as reports of gunshots. Students, faculty and staff could benefit from a clear action plan for emergencies we do not run drills for, including bomb threats and gun incidents. Furthermore, these online guidelines are only there if students seek them out. At minimum, this information should be given to RCAs, student leaders and others who are responsible for events with large numbers of people and who are likely to be in a position to direct people during an emergency. As an additional step, the University could take steps to explain such a plan to freshmen during orientation. Currently, freshmen receive detailed information about such various topics as fire safety, diversity and sexual assault. The University might simply educate RCAs concerning appropriate emergency response policies and have them convey this information to freshmen during one of their many orientation sessions. Such instruction need not be alarmist, but it should give students basic information that may prove helpful in the event an emergency strikes campus. We like to believe that nothing ever happens at Princeton, but, in case something does happen, the campus community needs to be informed on what to do to stay safe. The University and Public Safety can do so by making information better available to students, faculty and staff and by presenting the community with a clear plan for all types of emergencies. Doing so will help keep people safe and make the jobs of many throughout the campus easier in the event of a potentially dangerous situation.|~|
45841|~|On being a Forbesian|~|   October 17 2013|~|Column | Oct. 17 |~|Katherine Zhao|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|I was more than a little daunted when I made the first trek from the West Garage to Forbes on move-in day. It seemed like a universe away from university proper, perched on the side of Alexander Street, cut off from main campus by a quagmire of fences and yellow construction tape. There were 6-foot-deep holes here and there in the pavement, roped off by yellow tape, welcoming us to the land of Forbes. I spent my first week nursing blisters from walking several times to and from Forbes every day for classes, club meetings and late meal. After that first week, I resigned myself to wearing my boring old sneakers instead of all the cute shoes I bought for college. For a notoriously slow walker like me, the trek was a marathon. That, combined with a paralyzing paranoia of being late, had me leaving 20 minutes early for classes everyday, ensuring my peace of mind as I slowly snailed along. On my second day of classes I woke up at eight, confusing the buzzing of a construction truck for the buzzing of my alarm clock. Getting places was a hassle because once I was cozily ensconced in my room, I didn’t want to leave again. I dreaded the long late-night walks to paint at the art studio at the far end of Nassau Street. When classes started picking up in speed, and the weight of a million assignments hung heavily in my mind, the walks to and from Forbes became therapeutic. I began to enjoy the 15-minute breaks from constant stress. When President Eisgruber mentioned expanding Forbes as a possibility to increase the student body size, the knee-jerk reaction was, “Who’d want to live in Forbes?” I, or anyone else from Forbes, could answer that question. There’s something magical about living off main campus; I come back after a long day of classes to a place that’s familiar. I like the separation between school and dorms. At the end of the day, when I cross Alexander Street and see the familiar white paned windows and red brick walls, it feels like I’m going home. When I come back, my day is done. Though Forbes jokes are tossed around all the time for an easy laugh, there are benefits of living here that nobody else experiences. The popular conception that living farther away from everyone else brings us closer together is true. I find that I’m closer with people in Forbes because once we’re back for the night, we usually stay in and hang around. Instead of making the trek to Frist for late meal, we have study breaks in the Blackbox theater, stage impromptu ping-pong battles in the basement at midnight and watch Star Trek in the lounge until dawn. When I was choosing groups for Asian American Student Association projects, the Forbesians chose together and we ended up with a video production group who all lived in Forbes. My video group leader (who’s also in Forbes) told us that the same thing happened the year before as well. I’ve come to terms with living in a different time zone. I’ve found it relaxing to be far away from where I have class, to live in a dorm that’s just home and not school. I’ve been looking out the window every morning when I wake up, and I noticed that there’s now a new fence put up across the street. When the new arts center opens up, I’ll be the first to see it when I open my window one morning. When there were gunshots reported in Nassau Hall, I felt a small twinge of smugness in being safe and sound in Forbes, far, far away from up-campus turmoil. I’ve come to the conclusion that Forbes is a blessing in disguise. In exchange for walking 15 minutes to class everyday, I don’t have to worry about the freshman 15. It’s worth the walk and more for that chocolate fountain once a week, so for all of you non-Forbesians out there: I’ll see you Sunday.|~|

45469|~|Keep it small|~|   October 16 2013|~|Column | Oct. 16 |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In the wake of the announcement that a committee was being created to review grade deflation, another presidential proposal — that of expanding the undergraduate student body — was largely overshadowed in campus discussion. As a possible means of enlarging the University, President Eisgruber ’83 floated the idea of adding a seventh residential college or expanding Forbes College, currently the University’s smallest. Such an expansion, in either form, would be detrimental to both the student body and to the image of Princeton in comparison with its peer institutions. I went to a high school that had for more than 360 years prioritized and treasured its small size, and by the time I graduated, I had for six years personally felt the practical and tangible benefits of such an education. The most obvious of these is that classes were kept very small (before ECO 100, the largest class I’d been in since middle school was 20 people). Maintaining a small school matters because students become more invested in their own education. Even for no other reason than the simple fact that you’re very likely to be called on, you want to come to class prepared. Professors can more effectively teach classes, as they have a better sense of how well each student understands the subject. And everyone is more engaged in a class in which the professor and the students enrolled in the course know each other on at least a somewhat personal level. Furthermore, the abstract conception of a small school building as a “community environment” does in fact mean something. Statistically, in a small school you are more likely to run into people you know, acquaintances become friends more quickly and you can rarely be somewhere without being among friends. You are more likely to have more in common with the friends you make, because you are in each others’ classes, you participate in the same clubs and you go through parallel struggles and experiences. I bought this premise wholly and knew when I applied to college that on some level I wanted to continue to benefit from small classes and a strong school community. Obviously even the smallest liberal arts college would be significantly larger than most high schools, but I didn’t want to suddenly become one of 10,000 freshmen. One of the chief reasons I chose to apply to Princeton, and eventually chose to come, was precisely because of its comparatively small size. The absence of most professional schools measurably puts the emphasis on the undergraduate experience in terms of endowment per student, class sizes and classes taught by professors. And the residential college system breaks the class of 1,300 into groups of about 200 people you’re most likely to see day-to-day and get to know fairly quickly. Preserving all of these goods that are unique to smaller schools should be a key priority, and as such expanding the undergraduate student body seems rather misinformed. One obvious point is that the proposed increase in the student body would be marginal, not radical, and that any effects of dilution or increased anonymity would be minimal. The last expansion after the addition of Whitman College, for example, was only around a 10 percent increase, and the sky didn’t fall down. Class sizes didn’t suddenly balloon. The world didn’t end. But I believe that repeated marginal changes such as these to the student body will in the aggregate make a significant and harmful difference. I believe the current student population is of the right size: Big enough that a wide array of classes and activities can be offered and that you are always meeting new people, but small enough that you aren’t usually one of 450 in a class and that you always see your core group of friends. And while I don’t believe the number 5,200 is some objective standard for the perfect size of a university, I think the current size of Princeton makes sense. Slowly pushing this number higher and higher without a well-justified and case-by-case reason, however, does not. Gradually expanding, while at each step may lessen the initial shock of massive increases, in the long run leaves the same effect. If every 10 years, Princeton adds 150 more students, for example, no one expansion would feel drastic, and in fact each would feel proportionally less so than the last. But over the long-term life of the school, it would radically increase the student body. Perhaps no single increase would be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, but looking back years later, the quality and character of the University would be unrecognizable. By decreasing the simple likelihood of running into a given person, you make everyone feel that much more anonymous, that much less known in a place that is supposedly their home. Clubs become more competitive, and classes either increase in size or become harder to get into. This is not a goal that the Princeton administration should be striving toward. Princeton is a small university in a small town. It is designed on some level to feel like home; that is a characteristic not many schools can achieve and is a fragile one that shouldn’t be tampered with.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

Like columnist Isabella Gomes and many of my Facebook friends who linked to the article in angry or bewildered statuses, I strongly disagree with Shen.  I find something deeply problematic with his assumption that where there is alcohol, there will necessarily be rape — and that this is a reality to which Princeton students and administrators must resign themselves. It’s true, of course, that rape is more likely when alcohol enters the picture, but insofar as rape depends on one or both parties being in a (presumably drunken) state that makes consent impossible.  Just as you cannot get into a car accident without getting in a car, as one example, you cannot have drunken sex without drinking. Fine. Where Shen goes wrong is in assuming that the two unavoidably go hand-in-hand and that rape inevitably and inescapably follows from alcohol consumption. Sure, nonconsensual sex may require being in a state too drunk to consent, but that doesn’t mean that a drinking culture must necessarily lead to a culture in which 1 of every 8 undergraduates is raped.  I, like Gomes, argue that we can have one without the other — and, perhaps more to the point, we can have a culture of one that does not endorse or shrug off the other as mere collateral damage. To examine my argument more closely, let’s consider a less controversial example, one set outside of sticky eating club dance floors.  Say that, after graduation, a Princeton alumna named Alice moves to New York City.  One night, Alice visits her friends, who live in an apartment several blocks from hers.  At two a.m., she leaves for home and takes a shortcut through a dimly lit street, even though she knows that more murders occur in such settings than on major thoroughfares.  Then, while walking along this dark path, a man emerges from the shadows, holds a gun to Alice’s head, and kills her.  The question is, as with alcohol-induced rape, to what extent is Alice responsible for what happened to her?  After all, her decision to walk along a dark street ultimately resulted in her death — isn’t she, in some way, culpable? And yet, our intuitive response is that Alice is not responsible for her murder (at least not in any moral sense); the murderer is.  The important distinction to draw here is that between causal and moral responsibility:  Just because someone’s actions, like walking on a dark street or drinking to excess, ultimately cause some consequence doesn’t mean that we find the person who performed those distantly causal actions morally culpable for that consequence.  Instead, we say that the person who intended to cause the consequence — that is, the rapist or the murderer —is at fault.  To go farther back than that direct causal link is to open up a space in which it becomes permissible to argue that people are responsible for the more distant consequences of their actions:  that Alice caused her own death simply by moving to New York City, or that students cause their own rapes simply by matriculating at Princeton. The Alice example starts to disentangle the link Shen proffers between rape and alcohol.  But it also acknowledges the reality that – just as Alice’s risk of death increased when she chose to walk along the dark street  – the risk of rape increases when alcohol enters the picture.  To understand a risk, however, need not be to accept it, or more specifically, to accept responsibility for it.  (That is victim blaming, plain and simple.)  And it is certainly not to endorse it.  Shen’s argument, under this construction, becomes absurd:  He essentially argues that one consents to nonconsensual sex by consenting to party culture.  But to “implicitly support” a campus culture that, many steps down the line, sometimes results in rape is a different thing entirely from “implicitly supporting,” or consenting to rape itself. Princeton’s current rape rates are not a reality we need to accept on face.  As Gomes points out, rape and party culture can be separated, and change can be effected, with programs like “Unless There’s Consent.”  Perhaps the one thing Shen is right about is that we can’t change a “college culture” that revolves around drinking and sex.  (Nor, in my opinion, should we.)  But we need not, as Shen argues, throw our hands up and conclude that nonconsensual sex is the inevitable price we pay.  Instead, we need to shift the conversation, as “Unless There’s Consent” has attempted to do, away from victim-blaming and towards prevention.  |~|Cameron Langford is a politics major from Davidson, N.C.

45467|~|Keep calm and conform on|~|   October 16 2013|~|Column | Oct. 16 |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|Halfway through Frosh Week, as I sat on the chapel steps with a handful of other freshmen meeting our academic adviser for the first time, I was invited to observe. My adviser asked us to look at the students around us and see how many stood out; how many, out of the thousands of success-driven students at Princeton, all with impressive resumes and exceptional talents, really stood out? She brought to my attention the absence of unnaturally dyed hair, of unconventional piercings and of tattoos too large to be concealed under a suit skirt or a collared shirt among the student body. Since then, I’ve kept a quiet vigil; I have so far seen just one purple-haired boy and caught just a flash of what may have been inked skin underneath a sleeve. While I myself have no tattoos or piercings, and my hair is a nondescript brown (and it is true that many students at Princeton are not exactly the type to have a strong affinity for such things), the complete lack of these individualizers inside Princeton’s microcosm awoke me to a more troubling part of campus culture. It seems some Princeton students are so consumed by their futures and their “employability” in a growing job market that they are willing to shape their own identity around it. Far beyond a healthy preoccupation, future employment is at the forefront of student life and influencing their college experience to align with desirable employee skills. To Princeton students, an aspiring investment banker with tattoos winding down his arms is seen as one without a job. Piercings and tattoos are the extreme; their absence is simply one representation of the career-driven attitude that rules students at Princeton. What really is being lost is the sense of originality and freedom that is historically attributed to the greatest intellectuals of human history, and that I once associated with the academic seats of America. Coming to Princeton, genius for me was embodied by a classic photo of Einstein, his wild hair at all angles and his tongue sticking out. I expected much of Princeton to have a similar quirk of brilliance, some rejection of the status quo in favor of groundbreaking pursuits. However, I’ve noticed that many here have their sights set instead upon a secure profession, repressing the penchant for questioning conventions that education attempts to foster. Instead of focusing their talents and their lessons toward avant-garde ideas, many students are inclined to construct a resume — and therefore an identity — around their preconceptions of employer desires. The job is the end and the education merely the means. Even worse, pursuits that do not directly correlate with students’ future employment goals often are cast by the wayside in favor of activities more likely to impress corporate giants and Wall Street icons. This issue is a national epidemic, and understandably so with the economy still reeling. But as students at one of the most prestigious colleges in the world, we should be challengers rather than conformers. As we learn and grow on this campus, we should be creating an identity independent of current standards and using this individuality to redefine our environments. Our aim should be to analyze and to formulate, not to accept to ensure security. This university is meant to promote this sort of exploration; I find it almost disrespectful to focus a large portion of our energies on ensuring a comfortable career with little regard to Princeton’s appeal for individual innovation. The senior thesis alone is evidence enough to show the value Princeton places on personal and creative thought. Yet some students I’ve talked to anticipate the thesis as the addition of a published work to their application, not the unique and individual production that the thesis seeks to be. I agree that consideration for our future is prudent, but it is imprudent for us to become absorbed by such restrictions. Change is progress, and if we — the brightest of the next generation — do not instigate such change, it will never happen. And if nothing I’ve said has been compelling, consider all the black-suit, crew-cut would-be investment bankers, all with identical resumes built on identical principles and aiming for identical employment. Not one of them stands out, not one is memorable. Then consider the hundreds of people I encounter on campus daily, all gifted and all with impressive lists of credentials, but not one of which I remember — not one, that is, except for the one purple-haired boy.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

45185|~|What a No. 1 ranking could actually mean|~|   October 15 2013|~|Column | Oct. 15 |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|I don’t really know what I want to do with my life, but I know I want to change the world. Maybe something small, maybe something big, but I want to make a difference — leave my mark. Many of my freshman classmates share these hopes and ambitions with little idea how to achieve them. But that doesn’t worry me. After all, Princeton is supposed to be “in the nation’s service and the service of all nations.” The faculty and administrators have to be able to provide some guidance over the next four years. Right? It’s the numbers that worry me. According to The New York Times, almost 36 percent of Princeton graduates in 2010 with full-time jobs were in financial services. And that was down from the high of 46 percent in 2006 before the recession. Around campus I see the posters for lectures by Wall Street executives and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. I can’t even escape the presence of big business in my room. I keep opening emails about finance career open houses and interviews on campus. And I’m only a freshman. Don’t get me wrong. Students who want to go into financial services and consulting should be able to do so. But the heavy emphasis on these fields makes it seem like more is going on than just providing opportunities to those interested; it seems that the University, by providing ample information and opportunities to interview for Wall Street companies, is trying to convince other students who are unsure of what career they want to pursue that working in finance is a good idea. Maybe it’s partly a prestige thing; we, as a society, value money or think more highly of someone making a lot of money than we think of someone in public service. And Wall Street makes it so easy for Princeton students to obtain those jobs people hold in high regard. We associate income with achievement. It’s like an extension of the competitive college environment; when we graduate, we want the “best” jobs. Companies come to campus and wine and dine the students; it’s very seductive. Public service groups can’t compete. But is this cajolery enough to squash the naive dreams many students walk through FitzRandolph Gate with? We like to blame the mass exodus to Wall Street on students needing high-paying jobs to repay the massive college debt hanging over them. But Princeton and its peer institutions provide financial aid without resorting to loans. As President Eisgruber has boasted, 75 percent of Princeton graduates have absolutely no college debt, and the remaining 25 percent have an average debt of between $5,000 and $6,000. Princeton students, therefore, are free to go into whatever field they desire, not just one that pays well. We also have a high ranking in terms of alumni donations. U.S. News & World Report ranked Princeton second, with 62.4 percent of its alumni donating to the school. Of course, it’s great that former students love the school so much that they want to contribute funds. It means we have the largest endowment per student in the country and, thus, current students can enjoy a fantastic four years in the Orange Bubble. But, given these statistics, it seems undeniable that the University is benefiting from graduates making a lot of money in fields like consulting and investment banking. Princeton works with companies, making it easy for them to recruit students. After all, the ensuing Wall Street conscription benefits both institutions. The companies enlist bright young graduates, and the school ends up with richer alumni. But is it the students’ interest in these firms that leads the University to encourage the companies to come here, or does the presence of these firms on campus generate the interest from the students? CNN ranked Princeton as the number-one college in the United States with the highest-ranked graduates based on wages, with an average starting salary of $58,300 and a mid-career salary at $137,000. Yet, according to the same survey, only 49 percent of us think our job is meaningful. Should the University really be steering us into wealthy but unfulfilling adulthoods? I don’t know exactly what I want to do in life, but I know it doesn’t involve sitting in an office crunching numbers. And I really hope that when I am nearing graduation I don’t feel pressured to work on Wall Street and have been presented with viable alternative endeavors. I hope that we students can be more concerned about enriching each other in the classroom and less about making ourselves rich. Maybe when there is less University pressure pushing us in one direction, more students will trade in high salaries for a career they find more meaningful. And while we won’t be number one in average salaries or in donations to the University, perhaps not all number-one rankings should make us proud.|~|Marni Morse is a freshman from Washington, D.C.

45183|~|Revising writing seminar|~|   October 15 2013|~|Column | Oct. 15 |~|Rebecca Kreutter|~|None|~|Freshman year, after dining hall acquaintances have exhausted standard small talk on the weather — “Winter’s coming” — and last Saturday’s happenings — “You will not believe how late I went to bed” — there is one topic left sure to fill any lulls in conversation. Bring up writing seminar, and you’re set. Whether you’re complaining, commiserating or anticipating with dread, the words will flow on paper like they never do at 3 a.m. when the first revision is due. Writing seminar is designed, as its website states, to help students “build a solid foundation for their later work at Princeton, including junior independent work and the senior thesis.” The Outcomes Statement for writing seminar elucidates this goal, targeting thesis development, research and bibliographical skills, organized and expressive ideas, active revision and dialogue creation. While writing seminar does a decent job of addressing the writing aspect of independent work, it prepares students poorly for what it means to do independent research. No matter what type of high school students come from, resources were sparse compared to the diversity of databases, journals, books, audio files, personal notes and more that fill our 13 libraries and countless online platforms. In high school, research consisted of Google quests and perhaps the occasional key-term search in JSTOR or EBSCOhost. These are the skills we bring to college. Currently, writing seminars attempt to teach students about research. Freshmen venture to Firestone, meet a librarian and have a conversation about Princeton resources. These skills are supposedly internalized in the end-of-the-year research paper. After dutifully hearing about Princeton’s resources and the usefulness of reaching out to librarians, we turn back to Articles+ and start in with the key terms. This can work for a year or two when papers are based on in-class work, but when junior year comes around these high school skills no longer get the job done. Some may argue that junior seminars are where students can learn more concretely about research methodology. After all, isn’t that what many junior seminars are designed for? For example, junior seminar taught me to search for relevant peer-reviewed journals to see what topics are being discussed in a given field and to create a citation tree to find the most common and influential articles in a topic. By the time junior seminar comes up, however, students are already expected to be ready to start independent, unique, high-level research. At this point, seminars begin to teach students specific research methods related to their concentration. A basic level of research proficiency is assumed. The problem is, it is just not there for most people. In order to better prepare students for independent work, the stated goal of writing seminar, it should focus equally on academic writing and academic research. It would be more productive for both students and their advisers down the road if, instead of writing three papers over the semester, students wrote one small paper, spent the next month or more practicing concrete research skills and then finished up with a research paper. The research assignments would necessarily be overly pedantic, asking students to find a specific dataset such as “Ghanaian public opinion on the United States’ war on terrorism.” Professors could assign students a particular topic and have students identify the major names in that field, sketch out the development of the topic, summarize the history and talk about one potential field of research that could be explored. The end goal in these assignments would be high-quality research and would not involve arguing a thesis. This change would require some extra work from librarians and writing seminar professors, but then less guidance would be required in later years. Writing seminar is the ideal time and venue for getting students to think critically about their writing skills and more importantly about their research skills. Freshmen come to campus expecting to make changes to their habits in order to adapt to college, whereas juniors facing JP deadlines rush through with old, inefficient habits. Integrating research into the curriculum would also allow students to learn, fail and relearn research skills without the time pressure of independent work, allowing writing seminar to live up to its mission.|~|Rebecca Kreutter is a Wilson School major from Singapore, Singapore.

45053|~|We need more women|~|   October 15 2013|~|Column | Oct. 15 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Duncan Hosie  Sexism thrives at Princeton and in America. Yet misogyny is particularly forceful in one domain of our campus and society: politics. During the 2008 presidential campaign, hecklers confronted Hillary Clinton, encouraging the then-senator to “iron my shirt” and “make me a sandwich.” Marc Rudov, a contributor to Fox News, argued on national television, “When Barack Obama speaks, men hear: ‘Take off for the future.’ And when Hillary Clinton speaks, men hear, ‘Take out the garbage.’ ” The blatant bigotry wasn’t limited to a few isolated reactionaries. Respectable newspapers regularly included updates on Clinton’s hair, dress and makeup. (I don’t recall any stories about John McCain’s ill-fitting suits.) Clinton had to deal with charges from mainstream reporters that she was “shrill” and “emotional.”  Lamentably, misogyny continues to follow Clinton. Just last week, elected delegates at the California Republican convention circulated anti-Clinton buttons that declared, “KFC Hillary Special: 2 Fat Thighs, 2 Small Breasts … Left Wing. And it’s not just Clinton. In 2008, prominent liberals dismissed Sarah Palin as a “good-looking beauty queen” and a “dumb twat” instead of focusing on her policy proposals. Ostensibly serious reporters asked Palin about whether she received breast augmentation surgery and whether she was neglecting her children by running for vice president. Personally, I believe Senator Clinton lost her 2008 campaign because of sexism from the media and voters themselves. I also believe that sexism contributed, in part, to the resounding defeat of the McCain/Palin ticket. But this sexism does not just impact Clinton or Palin. The double standard that female candidates face, and the lack of popular outrage over the egregious treatment they receive from the media, sends a dangerous message to all American women. It suggests that the highest offices of American government are reserved for men, that women would be better off pursuing other careers and that politics itself is a men’s sport. American politics remains a men’s sport. Consider any level of American government. Municipal level? Among America’s 100 most populous cities, only 12 have female mayors. State level? Five states have female governors. Nationally? One out of every five members of Congress is female. According to the UN 2012 Women in Politics report, the United States is ranked 78th internationally in terms of the number of women elected to legislative or parliamentary bodies. We’re tied with Turkmenistan. Unfortunately, this is Princeton’s problem, too. With upcoming USG elections, it’s time to have a conversation about the role sexism plays in our own campus politics. According to the 2011 report of the Steering Committee on Undergraduate Women’s Leadership, there has been only one female USG president since 1994. In other words, Princeton has only had one female USG president in my lifetime, even though elections occur every year. Additionally, the report notes, “in the past 10 years, a woman ran for USG president only in 2003, 2007 and 2010.” Since then, Catherine Ettman ’13 ran for president in 2011 and faced criticism during the campaign that she was shrill. The report also observed that class presidents “tend to be male,” as do other prominent positions in campus life (for example, the editors-in-chief of this newspaper). Each current Princeton class president is male. And just last week, the freshmen voted in Class Council elections. They elected four males and one female. The one woman elected also received the fewest votes out of the five winners. If we want to increase women in government on the national level, we have to start on the collegiate level. By the time women are in college, they are much less likely to run for office, to win that office if they do run and to consider pursuing politics in the future. According to the Women & Politics Institute at American University, men aged 18-25 are twice as likely to have considered running for office later in life “many times.” The same study found that women aged 18-25 are 20 percent more likely, relative to men, to have never considered running for political office. The study contends that these gaps don’t fade over time; they persist for women’s entire lives. This is not just a women’s issue.  I’m a man, and I am equally harmed when our elected public servants, whether they be at Princeton or the marbled halls of Congress, don’t represent all of us. I believe that representative government needs to be, well, representative. Democracy depends on diversity. Ultimately, without full female representation, I don’t think USG or any elected body can truly reflect the people. Women of Princeton: We need you. I hope all undergraduate women reading this column will consider running for USG office. This University has made enormous progress in becoming more accepting of women. Since 1973, graduating classes at Princeton have been co-ed; since 1991, all eating clubs have accepted female members. We still have work to do, though. Of course, misogyny manifests itself in many forms on campus other than just USG elections. But making sure that the public face of undergraduates truly reflects all students is an important, and powerful, place to start.|~|Duncan Hosie is a sophomore from Belvedere, Calif.

I did not say that online education has encouraged state legislatures to curb funding for public institutions.  On the contrary, as I said in the lecture, there is strong evidence that intelligent use of online technologies can encourage state legislators to be more generous to public universities than they would have been otherwise. (An endnote to my talk — to be available soon on the ITHAKA website — contains a strong statement to this effect by the very able chancellor of the University System of Maryland, William “Brit” Kirwan.) Cuts in state funding for public higher education are a serious matter, but they are caused by factors other than advances in technology. Wrongheaded uses of minimalist versions of online technology can tempt governors to try and use technology to provide education “on the cheap” — but these temptations can and should be resisted, as all of us work to find more and more effective ways to use technology to improve educational outcomes in cost-effective ways.|~|William G.

45042|~|Changing perceptions of home|~|   October 14 2013|~|Column | Oct. 14 |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|Even as a first-year college student, I struggle to define the importance of place in my own experience. Living in Princeton demands that I acknowledge differences between this vision of suburban grandeur and the contrasting urban minutiae of my most recent home, Detroit. It is important to address the significance of displacement from one’s origins (dare I say, one’s roots). By addressing the process of familiarization with a place, perhaps we can understand more clearly our own habits of self-identification in relation to physical spaces. Although I was born in Detroit, I had lived in the suburbs bordering the city for most of my life. Thus, as a child, I thought the realities of urbanity did not concern me. The spatial discrepancies between my home at any given time (I had lived at eight locations prior to moving to Detroit) and the city established an emotional distance from the concerns of inner-city life. Growing up in a comfortable environment similar to that of Princeton benumbed my preparedness for the “other” — that not-so-distant reality that lay only miles away. As a black male myself, I would later realize how peculiar it was that, for the first seven years of my life, I had few African-American acquaintances. Separated from typical perceptions of inner-city culture, I held a myopic view of Detroit. In this way, suburbia served a dual role in my life. I adored it for its quasi-pastoral serenity; I would regret it for its prescriptive worldview. I could attribute the little I did know of Detroit to my grandparents, who had moved to the city soon after the 1967 riots. My grandmother’s unchanging mandate of safety restricted me from walking beyond their block unaccompanied. News of the city’s economic devastation, educational shortcomings and immoderate crime rates only reinforced my skepticism. Simply, I could not find Detroit’s appeal. But when I would visit the city, my grandfather would humble me. He was a gentle father geared toward a Southern sensibility. A retired firefighter for the city, he had many friends and emulators. In addition to maintaining and beautifying a local park, he sold clothes and hats as a vendor. Whether he was removing litter from his neighbors’ yards or dressing the city with fine attire, my grandfather wanted to help revitalize a place that was once the “Paris of the West.” Ewing’s sarcoma, a cancer, took his life in the summer of 2011. Beyond the immediate grief, I was shamed by my reluctance to embrace Detroit as he had done. If a man could devote himself to a place so freely, why couldn’t I open my eyes to it? My grandmother returned to Tennessee, and my mother and I moved into my grandparents’ old home as a symbolic gesture of preservation and renewal. Over the course of the following two years, I would immerse myself in the city, walking along the Detroit River to appreciate the Windsor-Ontario skyline, reading books on the edge of the fountain in Campus Martius Park, frequenting the small, locally-owned restaurants planted across the city. My conceptions of home shifted gradually from the outlying suburbs to this new, surprisingly familiar place. Perhaps it is because I made the transition to Princeton while trying to understand whether Detroit was my place of belonging that I felt the faintest sense of loss. It was as though by removing myself from this vision of home, I was constructing an irresolvable dissonance in my mind. Although Princeton is perhaps more reminiscent of my youth than Detroit, I suspect that whatever conceptions of “home” I may have lean away from simple comfort and physical security to a faux-romantic pursuit of urban fervor and undeterred movement. Here, it seems that my attempts to “become at home” involve harmonizing like elements so as to render a more familiar and inviting image. The process can often be quite nuanced. Consolidating the architectural elements of Alexander Hall with those of Saint Anne de Detroit Catholic Church, for example, allows a fluid exchange of sites peculiar to specific locations. Still, I can’t comfortably claim that I understand where my home truly is. Indicating a physical space may be the simplest solution. But there must be more. Whether I will learn to prize this new, intellectual domain as my primary (albeit temporary) home is undetermined. I think the ongoing discovery of home — whatever definition that word may imply — is an important narrative to consider. I urge all Princetonians to contemplate the degree to which we feel obligated to our birthplace — even those of us who call Princeton home. Once we graduate, having the advantages of a strong educational upbringing, where will we be expected to serve? Is there any goal superior to that of helping the community in which you were raised? I’m not yet fit to say. I suspect, however, that the kind of people we will be remembered as won’t be determined by one place alone. Instead, every location that fulfills us will, like a beautiful pigment, complicate the broad portrait of who we are.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich.

45054|~|Make of it what you will|~|   October 14 2013|~|Column | Oct. 14 |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|In his Oct. 7 column, Spencer Shen assessed the effectiveness of educational initiatives such as Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education’s “Unless There’s Consent” program and AlcoholEdu. He decided that while they had honorable intentions, they merely represented “superficial investment[s] in reducing the amount of sexual harassment and abuse that happens on campus.” He further claimed that the University itself should take more extreme measures in correcting the sexually indiscriminate hookup scene of the Street. It was at this point that I started thinking about this idea of “effectiveness” in any kind of movement — after all, if we can even help one person, doesn’t that make the effort worth the trouble? While “Unless There’s Consent” or AlcoholEdu might not be dramatically reducing the 15 percent figure of female Princeton undergraduate students who have experienced “non-consensual vaginal penetration,” they still manage to educate students. Sure, there could always be improvements to both programs, but if these initiatives can save even a single victim of sexual harassment or teach one student about this issue, then there really shouldn’t be any argument against their implementation. In fact, we should hope for more of these programs, especially those that accommodate the University student’s ever-hectic lifestyle. We should realistically consider that most students might not have time to join a student organization that teaches them about sexual harassment prevention. They also might not have the energy to attend a long conference meeting that talks about the dangers of underage drinking, but a student might respond to programs that manage to make these issues personal to him or her in a less intense way. Methods that spew out overwhelming statistics are less accessible to students. Rather, we should try to implement subtle, persistent techniques that could better transform the mindset of a student who was previously ignorant of these societal problems. If the University and student body could promote more of these programs, it would probably help to change the way students think about, talk about and approach partying on a more subconscious level. Shen alleges that “strict rules and harsh punishments like the Honor Code, or passive educational initiatives like AlcoholEdu … cannot actually alter students’ behavior significantly unless there’s consent from the students.” But how can student behavior change if there’s no higher authority or driving force instigating the conversation? No one can really conceptualize what the college culture is unless they have experienced it. This means that before we enter college, regardless of the stories we’ve heard from older siblings or the fantasies we’ve constructed from watching movies, there is no institution set in place to teach us what the implications of being a college student at this time in history really means. This means that programs such as AlcoholEdu and “Unless There’s Consent” have the opportunity to alter students’ mindsets before we even have a chance to engage in potentially dangerous activities. Beyond what the University can do, we, as students, need to reinvent the idea of what the college culture should entail, just as the students in past generations who have made it what it is. At every point in our college careers, we should vehemently reject this notion that “a campus culture which embraces partying and drinking will inevitably result in some occurrences of ‘non-consensual vaginal penetration.’” I know that I as well as many of my friends have gone to the Street without even the slightest fear or expectation that we would be subjected to any kind of harassment, and this makes me believe that it is possible — through education and collaborative effort — to create a college culture in which all students can feel this way. I’m not saying that we can definitively separate the idea of sexual interaction from the culture of social drinking and parties, but I believe that students should always be committed to dissociating the idea of harassment from the culture they’ve grown to enjoy. For many students, going to the Street will mean the possibility of hooking up or even the more innocent alternative of interacting with a potential romantic interest, but whatever the intention may be, we should be able to create an understanding that whatever happens during or after we leave the Street will be on our own terms and that our peers can and will respect the decisions we make. The majority of us have already shown that we are capable of creating an environment based on respect and trust through the fairly well adhered-to Honor Code established by the University.

45048|~|"Nothing ever happens in Princeton"|~|   October 14 2013|~|Column | Oct. 14 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|“Update. Police are still on the scene. No injuries reported. Stay away from Nassau Hall.” “Stay away from area. Updates to follow.” These warning messages from the Princeton Telephone and E-mail Notification System and Princeton Alert interrupted students in their usual nighttime routines last Tuesday. Reactions were swift. On the Class of 2017 Facebook page, for example, students advised others not to venture outside. Others posted reassuring messages. Links to the The Daily Princetonian’s live coverage of the investigation, news sites reporting the incident and the University’s Twitter account popped up in the comments. My friends got worried calls from home, and my phone blew up as people wondered where everyone was, whether it would be safe to walk home and whether it would be in everyone’s best interests to cancel that evening’s practice. There was, however, also an unmistakable air of skepticism among some students. While many took caution to stay indoors, others pressed on as though nothing had happened. Several teams chose not to cancel practice. Events such as residential college study breaks remained on schedule. As official updates failed to reveal anything new, impatience heightened; my friend joked that the initial report was probably a prank. The dismissive and nonchalant attitudes I encountered on Tuesday night reminded me of my initial reaction to the earthquake that devastated the Tohoku region of Japan in March 2011. It took my orchestra class a while to even realize the room was shaking, and when we finally did, we all poked fun at our principal cellist; we deemed her dramatic reaction, which had tipped us off to the tremor, to be an unnecessary overreaction. What was another minor tremor to people who had experienced harmless ones several times a year for over a decade? Even as the shakes continued longer than the average Tokyo mini-quake did, we maintained an air of joviality. It was exciting that after years of tedious practice runs, we finally got to experience a real evacuation drill. Some students forgot to leave their instruments inside and mimicked the scene from the Titanic where the quartet remains on board to provide uplifting music to the panicking crowd. I spotted a middle school physical education class that had evacuated from the swimming pool and was amused to see my brother getting carried away in the excitement, despite his lips having turned blue from the chill. It took me a while to realize that tremors as long-lasting and strong as the ones we felt in Tokyo that day probably originated from an epicenter somewhere else. It took me a while to understand that somewhere out there, people could be in unimaginable danger. The shame and guilt I felt when I watched news footage of the devastation the earthquake and subsequent tsunami left behind in towns up north were unbearable. I had always known that Japan was prone to earthquakes that could be deadly, and yet years of minor, insignificant tremors left me complacent — just like we are, here at good old Princeton. Yes, the extent of the eventfulness of Tuesday night was the initial report. Yes, it is true that Princeton is remarkably safe. And yes, as the evening progressed, it seemed likely that there was no real danger. It was understandable that students lowered their guard. But in a time where incidents of gun-related violence such as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the shooting of Trayvon Martin have thrust the issue of gun control so prominently into the political spotlight, even we in the Orange Bubble should maintain an appropriate air of caution during a situation like that which arose on Tuesday night. This time, nothing happened. The notion that “nothing ever happens in Princeton” was reinforced. We live in a place where the sound of a hammer hitting a chisel may be the closest thing to a gunshot we will hear. However, we should always maintain, at the very least, caution and respect for the potential of danger. It’s easy to be lured into a sense of security and forget that accidents can happen and that real threats do exist. We never know when a warning or a report will prove true. Yes, the Orange Bubble is safe. But bubbles can pop.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan. She can be reached at ljkim@princeton.edu.

44868|~|The recommendation whisperer|~|   October 13 2013|~|Column | Oct. 13 |~|Anthony Grafton|~|None|~|It’s fall again. I can tell, even though I’m not in Princeton to see the leaves change color, but on leave in an undisclosed location 50 miles away. In a professor’s life, fall is not the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. It’s the season of transcripts to scan and personal statements to edit, the search for the telling anecdote and the scramble for the unhackneyed adjective — not to mention the realization that you can’t describe each of three students as the best one you’ve worked with in your career. Fifteen years ago, I spent the fall semester — high period for recommendations — as a visiting professor at a German institute, which kindly stamped and sent out my official letters. Much of a professor’s business, by then, was already carried out electronically, but recommendations usually had to be printed, signed and mailed by a particular date. So almost all the letters I actually sent were recommendations. At the end of my stay, the institute’s business office informed me that I had produced 180 of them. Not 180 separate letters for 180 individuals, of course — but 180 letters nonetheless. These days, I have no idea how many letters I write in a given fall. In most cases, I turn my texts into pdfs and upload them — often at sites that require you to remember and enter one of your 10,000 passwords and then stand on one foot and recite “Carmelita, Marmelita” while you submit the letter, to prove that you’re not a spambot. Letters for law school and medical school, honorific fellowships and for graduate admissions, letters for postdoctoral fellowships and jobs, letters for research fellowships and visiting positions — all of them go out, in shoals, from September through December. It’s a challenge. First of all, if you’re as disorganized as I am, there’s the difficulty of remembering to write and send them all at the proper time; I do a spreadsheet, but then have to remember to consult it regularly, and sometimes I miss and need to be reminded.  But the real problem is how to make each recommendation do its job. You do your best, each time, to give a sense of the person in question: You look for the facts that tell a distinctive story and suggest the outlines of a living character, and you do your best to describe in living detail distinctive performances in class and on paper and in other contexts. You also try not to recycle too many generic phrases (especially those ambiguous classics, “Good wasn’t the word for his work,” “You’ll be lucky if you can get him to work for you,” and “I cried”). Lazy and selfish creatures that we are, we professors mostly mention letters of recommendation in order to complain about these letters. We grumble about the time they cost — in my case, whole days of letter-writing, that start before dawn and end long after dark. And we congratulate friends outside the academy, who can spend their fall weekends leaf-watching rather than word-processing. But in a curious way, we know that this is also one of the rewards of our peculiar calling. Writing these letters, you think over the teaching you did last year and reconnect with people you taught 10 and 20 and 30 years ago. You feel proud that people still rely on you, as in some cases they have for decades, to provide accurate, cogent and eloquent accounts of their merits to their colleagues, their present or potential employers and the patrons who might sponsor their research. You enjoy seeing and saying how much your one-time students have accomplished in what seems the very short time since they first came to see you about writing a JP or appeared in one of your courses. And you realize that your friends, the people you met in the archive or the library when you were all young, have become scarily distinguished. Writing letters is part of our routine — but it also lifts you out of routine by bringing long-forgotten moments of laughter and revelation in classrooms, office hours and libraries back to mind. So much for the bright side. But there’s also a dark one. What were once plentiful opportunities for graduate study and for research have become rare. Despite all the rants about the folly of going to law school or to graduate school in the humanities, it’s become harder than ever to gain entrance to top programs. Support for scholarship in the fields I work in is dwarfed by the demand from highly talented people. The global climate keeps growing warmer, but the academic one becomes colder every fall, and the ever greater intensity of the demand for letters is a yearly reminder of these hard facts. Writing all these letters really matters, in the end, because it’s the only way we have, and a frail one, to help people who matter to us.|~|Anthony Grafton is the Henry Putnam University Professor of History.

44884|~|Editorial: Grade deflation has negative consequences|~|   October 13 2013|~|Editorial | Oct. 13 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Last week, President Eisgruber charged a committee of nine faculty members to review Princeton’s grade deflation policy in order to determine whether the policy has had “unintended impacts upon the undergraduate academic experience that are not consistent with our broader educational goals.” The Editorial Board has repeatedly taken the position that grade deflation is detrimental to Princeton students and the overall mission of the University and is encouraged by Eisgruber’s revisiting of the policy. Today, in light of this announcement, the Board reiterates its disapproval of the grade deflation policy and proposes the potential alternative that grade distributions for courses be reported internally to Princeton students. The board continues to believe that the grade deflation policy, which holds that no more than 35 percent of grades in any given department should be A-pluses, A’s or A-minuses, is unfair and has negative consequences for Princeton students. Firstly, holding departments and professors to an arbitrary numerical cutoff for the number of A-range grades they may award undermines the ideal of students receiving the grades they merit. Despite the fact that the policy is intended to operate at the department level, professors often enforce it on the level of individual classes. This is problematic because whether a student has mastered the course material and done excellent work is not contingent on that student outperforming 65 percent of the class, but on that student’s individual knowledge and performance. There is no reason that a maximum of 35 percent of students in a given class can do excellent work, but the current grading policy incentivizes professors to set curves and give out grades in a distribution that matches the University policy, rather than award individual students the grades they deserve. Moreover, the Board does not feel that there is a compelling reason to believe that a maximum of 35 percent of students in a given department will be doing excellent work at any given time. Secondly, the Board believes that the grade deflation policy damages the prospects of Princeton graduates relative to graduates of our peer institutions in the competition for jobs, fellowships and graduate school placements. In the years since the implementation of the policy, none of Princeton’s peer institutions have followed our lead. The grade deflation policy shifts the distribution of Princeton grade point averages such that fewer Princeton students are eligible for jobs and fellowships with minimum GPA cutoffs. Furthermore, the Board believes that knowledge of Princeton’s policy is not sufficient to cause potential employers or graduate schools to judge lower Princeton GPAs equivalent to higher, non-deflated GPAs of students from schools like Harvard or Yale — thus harming the future prospects of Princetonians. Thirdly, the policy is currently implemented in an inconsistent fashion. Some professors immediately inform students in their class that no more than 35 percent of the grades they give will be in the A-range despite the fact that the policy was intended to function at the level of departments rather than classes. Other professors openly acknowledge that they will not follow the dictates of the policy. This inconsistency is another reason to doubt the merits of the current grading policy. For these reasons, among numerous others, the Board recommends the repeal of the grade deflation policy. However, the Board recognizes that the policy was designed to address legitimate concerns regarding the gradual inflation of grades across academia and disparities in grading across departments. One potential policy that could help address these problems is publishing the course grade distributions on SCORE so that they would be accessible to students, faculty and the administration. Publicizing grade distribution information would increase the transparency for students, placing all students on an equal playing field when trying to figure out the relative difficulty of a course. Furthermore, professors would be incentivized to apply rigorous grading standards to their courses, so that their courses do not gain a reputation for being easy A’s and attract unprepared students. Professors with courses that have grade distributions that are consistently skewed toward A’s may be subjected to informal shaming from administrators or fellow faculty. Such an incentive would help check grade inflation without imposing arbitrary numerical limits on A grades. Lastly, increasing the availability of information about grade distributions in different departments could help professors to gauge the relative difficulty of courses in their department as opposed to others — potentially helping bring grading standards in different fields into greater alignment. This proposal is one potential alternative to Princeton’s current policy. The Board encourages President Eisgruber and the committee tasked with examining grade deflation to consider the strength of the numerous arguments against the policy and hopes that it will propose a reasonable alternative that addresses the problem of grade inflation while avoiding many of the pitfalls that problematize the current policy.|~|
44867|~|The seduction of a sweatshirt|~|   October 13 2013|~|Column | Oct. 13 |~|Lauren Davis|~|   Columnist     |~|“Until you conquer the fear of being an outsider, an outsider you will remain.” -C.S. Lewis, “The Inner Ring” Gathering dust in my closet at home is a collection of sweatshirts that I can’t seem to bring myself to throw out. Each is a neatly folded badge of past attempts to find an identity: The trendy underground music aficionado, the peppy girls’ varsity swimmer, the slightly smug New England prep schooler. This pile has doubled during my years at Princeton, with additions from residential college sports teams, intelligent-sounding student groups and, most recently, the sorority I decided to drop. Beyond just nostalgic mementos, these shirts are trophies from exclusive inner circles I once longed to join, fought to gain entry into and then left behind. The story of seduction and striving, followed by dissatisfaction, has stayed the same, but I’ve fallen for it time and time again. My towering stack of emblazoned clothing represents this insatiable desire to be part of an inner circle — something I struggle to reconcile within myself and in others. Much has been written about this topic before, but it’s worth revisiting simply because it’s so fundamental to who we are as human beings. When applying to selective prep schools and colleges, rushing a sorority, interviewing for student groups and bickering an eating club, I justified my decisions on the grounds of authentic desires for a quality education or deep friendships. But undeniably stirring below the surface of these rationalizations was a less admirable force: a longing to be accepted and feel the pride and hint of superiority at adding a shiny new badge to my chest for the world to see. Speaking to London university students in 1944, C.S. Lewis elegantly and timelessly termed this allure of exclusivity as the desire for “The Inner Ring” — a phenomenon not inherently evil, but unavoidable. The notion of the Inner Ring, so unusually prominent at Princeton, where affiliations are stamped loudly onto our clothing and day-to-day reality, is something that we will face in a variety of forms throughout life. No matter how I try to justify it, “exclusion is no accident; it is the essence” in any group that admits some but not others. As Lewis noted, “the passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.” In my psyche an ongoing war rages between the reasonable critic, who sees objectively the inconsistencies in what I do, and the vulnerable, impulsive, emotional victim who craves to be soothed. It’s this tension between high-minded principles and everyday needs that leaves many of us so conflicted. While it’s unrealistic to think we can eradicate our basic tendencies, we can choose whether we want to let that yearning “to be ‘in’ ” to rule us, or to find some other, more consciously selected kind of motivation. I can’t change my past decisions that have brought me to where I am now. I’m aware that I’ve been able, for whatever reason, to acquire many badges that others haven’t. It is a sad truth that “the circle cannot have from within the charm it had from the outside. By the very act of admitting you it has lost its magic.” As I change and outgrow these externally defined Inner Rings, I feel less of a need to advertise them so prominently or self-consciously, and I’ve started to see them more clearly for what they are. With the good­ inevitably comes the bad — the sense of entitlement and cruel exclusivity that, even if not promoted by any particular individual, is still the net result of the group as a whole. Systems of selection and tradition, like Bicker, or the admission process to Princeton, can in turn act as a scapegoat for any emotional repercussions caused by rejecting others. The process of Fall Bicker left me feeling deeply and acutely guilty. What I said could contribute someone’s being relegated to the “outside,” even though I had absolutely no right to that power over their fate. We play mind games with ourselves to soothe our own fears; fears that, ironically, we all share, but seem unable to admit openly. One day while wearing a particular T-shirt, I received friendly greetings from at least four people who wouldn’t have known me or acknowledged me, except that they too bore the same logo. Did our shared “belonging” shrink the gap between us and allow genuine friendliness, or was it purely social obligation which ultimately means little? To what extent should we fight the natural order to forge our own unique path, versus navigating the already trodden but much-populated road of convention? It can seem lonely to be out on the edge, but the more I solidify my own values, goals and passions, the less I long for the Inner Ring. Ironically, without even looking for it, I stumble upon a feeling of being “inside” based not upon externally drawn lines, but upon something else. Perhaps, this is a taste of something closer to real friendship. I ordered an eating club sweatshirt two years ago when I joined, but it never arrived. I’m not sure I want to track it down.|~|Lauren Davis is a philosophy major from London, England. She can be reached at lhdavis@princeton.edu.

44573|~|More harm than good|~|   October 10 2013|~|Column | Oct. 10 |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|As the Triangle Club song goes, “New Haven has its murders , Philadelphia decays and in the town that’s home to Brown,  they smoke away the days. They kill themselves in Ithaca ; in Hanover it snows. There’s violent crime in NYC ; in Cambridge egos grow.” But in Princeton we have grade deflation. Although the lyrics of the Triangle song jest at each school’s respective stigmas, grade deflation is a real problem. Last year, when choosing which college to attend, by far one of the most agonizing choices I (and likely many students on campus) have ever had to make, Princeton’s grade deflation policy was a thorn in an otherwise easy choice. And I suspect I am hardly alone in this regard. The Class of 2017 Facebook page was filled with concerned posts about the effects of grade deflation, and the best pieces of advice upperclassmen could give were often something along the lines of, “You’re going to get B’s and C’s. Relax. Everyone does.” The problem with grade deflation isn’t that we will probably get some lower grades — at a school of Princeton’s caliber, that is to be expected. Rather, the issue is that B’s and C’s are expected and indeed are seen as inevitable. Now, however, University President Christopher Eisgruber ’83 has tasked a committee to reevaluate Princeton’s grading policy, which has been in effect since 2004. It is indeed high time that the decade-old policy be updated. First and foremost, the use of a numerical guideline for the allocation of grades, while well-intentioned, does more harm than good. It was designed by former Dean of the College Nancy Malkiel to curb the rising problem of grade inflation, but since then, the policy has been misapplied. While intended as a limit on A’s given in the departmental unit as a whole, some professors apply the numerical limits to specific courses, which in turn harms the students. Especially in introductory classes, which often have hundreds of students, perhaps a third of them can get an A grade. This knowledge, and indeed this mentality, fosters negative academic competition. Knowing that I may or may not be one of the select few to walk out the door with one of the coveted A grades makes me less willing to aid, cooperate or otherwise work with people who may very well “nab” one of the few A’s as well. It’s not as if classes aren’t already difficult enough at Princeton. It is evident when students produce A quality work or when they get over 90 percent on a test that they deserve a suitable grade to match their performance — which is not always the reality under grade deflation. There is a preexisting organic demarcation, a naturally existing boundary between A, B and C quality work in the form of the bell curve, because of the fact that some students do better than others and subsequently earn a higher grade. That being the case, grade deflation is simply unnecessary and just serves to induce further stress among the student body by acting like the proverbial sword hanging over our necks. What’s more, professors, when building a course, design assignments and tests to accurately gauge student capability. The grades students earn are indications of their mastery of the course load and of their ability to apply what they have learned, so why does the Princeton administration need to step in and implement active grade deflation at the seemingly arbitrary 35 percent threshold? If 40 percent, or 45 percent or even 50 percent of students in a class manage to do well in a class, surpassing a professor’s expectations, they are rightfully entitled to that A grade. And, of course, the grade deflation policy only hurts the prospects of Princetonian graduates as they leave school and enter the job market or apply to graduate school; our peer institutions have not followed suit in Princeton’s example of active grade deflation, and as such, our graduates are at a distinct disadvantage. For instance, although Yale has not released the statistics of its graduating class since the 1980s, Stuart Rojstaczer, a former Duke University professor and a noted grade inflation researcher, estimated that the average GPA at Yale in 2012 was equivalent to an A-, while the average GPA was equivalent to a B- just 50 years ago, according to an article published in The Yale Daily News. From a purely numerical standpoint, Yale students clearly seem to have the upper-hand upon completing their undergraduate studies. Grade inflation can clearly be a problem, when too many students get too many high grades. But forcing competition and artificially suppressing grades is not the solution. In the end, at a school like Princeton, where instructors already design classes to test each student’s respective capabilities, grade deflation is an unnecessary policy that only serves to harm the student body. Let the professors be the judges of work quality, and above all, give A-level work an A grade.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. He can be reached at jasonjc@princeton.edu. 
44567|~|Rank inflation?|~|   October 10 2013|~|Columns Opinion |~|Susannah Sharpless|~|None|~|I have chosen — and it’s sad that this had to be an actual choice — to spend my time as a Princeton student focusing on what I’m actually learning and not on the number of zeroes at the end of my probable starting salary. This means I fight with my parents a lot and have a gut-deep distaste for the career fair. This also means that I have never really been that stressed out about grade deflation. Most of the time, I feel that I deserve the grade I get. If I think I deserved a better grade than I received, I think back to the outfits I used to wear in sixth grade and remember never to trust my own judgment. I also remind myself that the learning is what’s important, not the letter. That said, I would not complain if it were easier for me to get an A, so at first I was excited when Eisgruber announced plans to reexamine the policy. The more I think about it, however, the more I worry about why Princeton would even consider making this change in the first place. While I would obviously be happy to see grade deflation go, I think we need to consider whether the underlying motives are truly in the student body’s best interests, not just focus on how pretty our transcripts will look if the faculty finds that the policy’s 10-year reign has been unsuccessful. The increasing importance of unilateral, numerical assessments in education — a result, in part, of measures initiated by No Child Left Behind and its accompanying programs — has been largely criticized. As standardized tests become more and more important, teachers find themselves subjected to regular evaluations, and their schools are ranked (or closed) according to their ability to meet these standards. Though this only applies legally to public institutions, private schools and universities too are beginning to feel pressure to prove they’re successful. And prove, in this case, means with numbers. Considering this climate, I would not be surprised if Princeton’s real motivation in looking again at grade deflation is actually a way to make our (very excellent) stats stay this way. There are several ways our institutional anxiety about being “the best” manifests itself, from our desperation for inclusion in a Harvard/Yale rivalry that has nothing do with us to our quiet reinstitution of early action admissions that allowed us, at least partly, to compete with these school’s yields. The competition I would like to examine most closely, however, is the one that is arguably the most widely referenced: that of the U.S. News and World Report’s highest ranked college. We’ve won it before and we’ll win it again, but when my Facebook News Feed exploded with Tiger pride — which I found annoying and arrogant — I was gratified to see among all the boasting a link to an Atlantic piece by John Tierney that pointed out problems with the rankings. The most striking sentence in the article explained how the rankings can become more important to universities than the actual quality of their education, motivating them “to do what they can to raise their place in the rankings by, for example, spending lots of money on things the U.S. News formula deems important or by” — and this is the most important part — “aggressively increasing the size of their applicant pool so they can turn away a higher percentage of their applicants, thus showing themselves to be ‘more selective’ and thereby raising their rank.” I know there are other factors influencing our discussion about grade deflation, but I don’t think we can forget that the most identifiably negative aspect of grade deflation is the bad press it gives us. The fact of the matter is that — to the high-achieving kids Princeton wants to attract — grade deflation is a huge deterrent. And Eisgruber’s desire to expand the student body presents a problem: We’d like to get bigger, but God forbid we get less selective. A Princeton that is easy to get into would not be the Princeton we’re so proud of, nor would it be the number one school in the country. If we get rid of grade deflation, or at least seem open to the idea of getting rid of grade deflation, we become almost perfect. The student body can get larger while Princeton stays just as elite. It’s not that I think getting rid of grade deflation would be a bad move: I would take a 4.0 any day. What I am worried about is that this may reveal the Eisgruber administration’s possible — and unacceptable — preoccupation with prestige, statistics and meaningless numbers that eclipse the real reason we’re all here: to learn. That’s what matters most. Being number one should come second.|~|Susannah Sharpless is a religion major from Indianapolis, Ind.  She can be reached at ssharple@princeton.edu. 
44560|~|Editorial: Revisiting the freshman rush ban|~|   October 10 2013|~|Editorial | Oct. 10 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|With the announcement of rush numbers this week, the Board feels that it is important to discuss the effects of the freshman rush ban. When the ban was initially passed, many observers thought that it would hurt membership in Greek organizations. The thought was that sophomores who were better established would have less of an interest in social organizations than new freshmen who were still looking for friends and for groups to join. However, with the release of the statistics for sorority rush, it is clear that this has not been the case. This year’s rush numbers are almost identical to the number of students who rushed in the years before the ban. While we have written in the past about the ban and still feel that it should be one semester rather than a year, we feel it is important to revisit this topic in light of these new numbers. On the one hand, the ban has in some ways achieved its goals. During rush this year, anecdotal evidence suggests that sophomores rushed with an established group of friends. If the aim of the ban was to encourage people to first form friendships outside of Greek organizations, it seems to have worked. As a result of having to wait a year, the people who rushed have had ample time to think about their activities on campus and decide whether Greek life is a good fit for them. The ban has undoubtedly eliminated some of the pressure to rush that comes from being a freshman who is new to Princeton and looking to meet people and for a way to fit in. Additionally, the ban has helped sophomores who chose to rush by giving them more time to consider their options. By giving potential rushees more time to meet members from different organizations, the ban has helped them more closely evaluate their options. Furthermore, it has given members of fraternities and sororities more time to meet potential rushees. One criticism of freshman rush was that it favored people who came from high schools that send many students to Princeton. The worry was that students who came from smaller, less wealthy schools did not have anyone to guide them through the rush process and would therefore be discouraged from joining a Greek organization. We feel there is reason to believe that the ban has helped open Greek life to more people and has given students more time to consider its pros and cons. The Board does worry that the ban may have served to isolate students more. One of the arguments for joining a Greek organization has always been that it exposes students to a group of people that they might not otherwise meet through their academics or extracurricular activities. Students rushing with their friends may have lost some of this advantage. However, even those who rushed with friends will be able to benefit from Greek life’s ability to connect younger students with upperclassmen. Again, we reiterate our belief that a shorter ban that lasts a semester would help connect these students to upperclassmen earlier while addressing those concerns that prompted the institution of a yearlong ban. What is clear though is that there is still a place for Greek life on campus. The large number of rushees indicates that there are still sophomores who think that Greek organizations have something to offer them. These sophomores have friends and are established within Princeton but still saw potential benefits in the Greek experience. While the ban has helped limit some of the negative aspects of fraternities and sororities, it has also helped highlight the value they add to the lives of many Princeton students. ABSTAIN: Ethan Jamnik, Brandon Holt, Zach Horton DISSENT: Lily Offit, Sean Chen “Fixing” the Greek system by moving to a one-semester ban is a step in the wrong direction. Such a regressive move would serve only to continue to place our newest arrivals on campus at the mercy of what the Working Group on Campus Social and Residential Life called a “faux Greek system” characterized by “social stratification, cliquishness and high-risk drinking and hazing.” Let’s be honest: Greek life at Princeton still serves largely as a pipeline to the selective clubs. It undermines the social diversity it has taken generations for the University to achieve. Rather than compromise our ideals, let us redouble our commitment to inclusiveness. Let the new leadership of this University hear the voices of those who decry a faux Greek system that only further stratifies and isolates, plays to insecurity and weakness, rather than building the sense of community that this University strives to embody.|~|
44351|~|Skip the skimming|~|   October 9 2013|~|Column | Oct. 9 |~|Prianka Misra|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|Every semester, as I browse Course Offerings, I go through a phase where all I do is wince. The large numbers stare back at me from the computer, menacing me. I stare on incredulously — 150 pages of reading a week? How interesting that such a large number is often seen as a desirable option in this scenario. 200? Not bad, I think. When it comes to 300, I begin to wonder how anyone thinks this is possible in the first place. I am sure I am not the only one to have stared blankly at a daunting reading assignment on a syllabus. What audacity. Boldly stating, “pgs. 46-159,” such assignments, from my perspective, beg for insincerity. There is no way I can spend so many hours completing one of four reading assignments like this for one lecture of one class. And how can I resist using the cloak of anonymity that large lectures grant? The only time I would be motivated to take on this challenge would be for precept, when I might have to participate … But couldn’t I just make something up instead? The idea is too tempting, and so my reading assignment is whisked away to the low-priority list of tasks — a place of no return. My friends have told me to learn to skim. Aside from the fact that I have found myself incapable of doing so while retaining any useful information, I really just don’t appreciate the idea of reading insincerely. When I tell them this, they say I must do so out of necessity. In order to survive, you must skim. But it doesn’t have to be this way. I am not simply complaining about having too much work here — it’s the way we view the work, and the values that we are inherently encouraging when this type of work is assigned, that concern me. Our system of education for reading-based classes is almost encouraging students to halfheartedly complete their assignments. We have subscribed to a system which compares whose “precept hat” is the largest, or who has the best ability to come up with commentary on the spot — commentary on a reading assignment that likely hasn’t been finished because it was simply too long. When 200 or more pages of reading are assigned on a given night (or even in a week), students only receive a topical and superficial understanding of the literature they read. When they are subsequently tested on such material, they may be forced to make deductions and comment in a way that does not represent an accurate understanding of the material — just a condensed and watered-down version of what we really should be learning. Providing these halfhearted answers is certainly not the professor’s fault, but nonetheless the result is the same. Students resort to finding answers just for the sake of saying something, not saying something that will actually contribute to the conversation. My question is this: As a top-tier educational establishment, do we want to encourage students to have a comprehensive and well-rounded comprehension of a few key documents and texts? Or do we want to throw out as much information as possible, and watch while those who are clever enough to toy around with key phrases speak up in precept, while others who attempted (and simply couldn’t finish) the reading slip into silence? While there are always a few exceptions of sincere readers who do actually manage to get through all of the reading, the game we play in precept feels like an assessment of street smarts rather than one of true analytical aptitude. The realists will say that this is how the world after graduation works in many job settings. In the future, your higher-ups may throw tons of information at you, and you will have to condense the information into a cohesive, unique and informed argument. But how much of this is truly informed, and how much is fabricated? While thinking on your feet is certainly a valuable skill in the real world, pure effort and a thorough understanding of your task at hand are arguably no less vital to have. Huge reading assignments are limiting — the time that you are willing to spend on your vast and unending span of pages will serve as your glass ceiling, and there’s only so much you can learn from reading the first line in each paragraph. Who knows how much more we could gain from cutting down the page limit for each class to 150 or 100 pages a week? We could appropriately analyze every reading assignment that we had, looking beyond key terms at more nuanced concepts. We could have more meaningful discussions in precept, not just echo sessions of one person’s astute comments. We could learn so much more, if only we decided to skip the skimming.|~|Prianka Misra is a sophomore from Castro Valley, Calif. She can be reached at pmisra@princeton.edu. 
44342|~|Living in the world|~|   October 9 2013|~|Column | Oct. 9 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|You could, I suppose, call me exercise-adverse. You won’t, for instance, find me in Dillon Gymnasium for pursuits more athletic than the Frosh Week activities fair. Nor will you see me in Jadwin wearing any uniform besides that of the Band — a decidedly not sporty bunch. I gain very little pleasure from pushing my body to do what neither it nor I want to do. But as I rush to 8:30 a.m. orgo on Tuesdays and Thursdays this semester, I find myself missing my semi-regular early morning routine of last year. Then, as I jogged around Carnegie Lake gasping for air, my eyes, ears and nose were gulping in stimuli of their own, from the sunrise-red dew and the birdsong to the occasional deer or family of goslings I’d meet along the way. I’m in no way an expert on the physiological benefits of exercise, so I’ll leave that discussion to other writers. The benefit of my time on the towpath was access to something uncommon at Princeton — experience of the physical world, separated from my academic life and its trappings. On a college campus, we are enveloped in the realm of the Idea writ large. Our days are spent thinking about abstract constructs, from late-classical ideals of the female to efficient search algorithms. Seldom do administrators, faculty or students allow the setting to interfere with ideas — indeed, academic buildings, from the depths of Firestone to the brute heights of Fine seem built to keep out the physical world. On a campus like ours, far from the intruding bustle of a large city, we are even further separated.  The reality, of course, is that the ideas we live for here do correspond with the world outside FitzRandolph Gate, and even with our personal lives outside of the classroom, lab and library. It’s silly for an academic of any pursuit to seek total isolation from external intrusion; the same Orange Bubble which allows ideas to ferment in peace provides ample opportunity for them to turn sour. But study at Princeton — an isolated and immersive environment — fosters, by its very nature, a sense of separation between the life of the mind and the life of, well, everything else. This dichotomy plays right into the “work hard/play hard” mentality I’ve seen in so many of my peers, wherein time not spent having a maximal amount of fun (via the Street, band, gaming or other sources of reckless abandon) or optimizing one’s skills and ideas for the future is seen as dead time to be avoided. Or at least that’s the caricature presented of us by analysts from this paper to The New York Times who have bemoaned the “end of courtship” or the dearth of coffee dates. The claim is that we can’t keep a sustained romantic relationship because it would be a distraction from our ladder-climbing and skill-honing. Such disequilibrium is unsustainable, of course. For evidence, we need look no further than the trope of relationships begun as commitment-free on the Street turning into something more. Even when they don’t last due to miscommunicated expectations, the fact that we tend to seek more emotional attachment speaks volumes of our need for romantic connection, human connection, indeed connection to all aspects of the world. Despite efforts to provide us with our own orange island, the University seems to have recognized the value of venturing into the physical world in at least some respects. Though other authors have shared here legitimate complaints about how “orange-tinted” Princeton’s study abroad programs can be, done right they provide ample means to stimulate us with the messiness of the “real world.” More valuable in this respect are, I believe, the pre-orientation frosh activities OA and CA. It’s hard to remain enveloped in abstract ideas when the very real issues of a sputtering camp stove, a service task unfinished or a wet tarp for sleeping intrude into our first experiences as freshmen. That we benefit from — even need — this sort of intrusion explains our love of another Princeton icon, the squirrels. How can we remain trapped in our minds when these foraging, scampering fools keep leaping into our paths, our food and our bedrooms? As I write this, I realize the irony of producing a navel-gazing column urging escape from the land of the idea. But then I glance out the window at Connecticut’s fall colors, feel my sleeping girlfriend’s head on my shoulder, hear the mutterings of dozens of other travelers over the smell of the diesel fumes and smile. We have a human need to connect to people, to feel the world around us, to be more than minds in an ivory tower. And because we need to, we’re pretty good at it.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a sophomore from Littleton, Colo. He can be reached at bam2@princeton.edu.

44346|~|Perchance to be |~|   October 9 2013|~|Column | Oct. 9 |~|Ye Eun Charlotte Chun|~|None|~|One of the most terrifying things I’ve had to cope with growing up was being alone. As an only child growing up with a working parent, I always kept to myself at home, picking up various hobbies to keep myself busy until my mother came home. I taught myself how to knit and wood carve, even venturing into bison herding in Southern Illinois one summer, to keep myself grounded in the process of moving schools half a dozen times before my teens. The last two years of high school were particularly trying, as I took care of my grandparents single-handedly while my mother worked abroad. People ask me what motivated me to get a license in Korean cooking and joke about how bored I must’ve been to try; in reality, I had been learning to cook for my grandparents, who only ate Korean food. When friends mocked me about always going home during the holidays, I never told them it was because I was my grandfather’s legal guardian and had no choice but to return. It’s no wonder then that Princeton was such a breath of fresh air to me. For the first time, I didn’t have to worry about someone other than myself; I could pursue exactly what I wanted without anything to stop me. In reality, I found myself swept away by students who were so driven and fixated upon their futures that they had little time for anything else. People told me that they felt guilty when they had free time. When given a choice between spending four hours cultivating a new hobby or finding activities to build their five-star resumes, few seemed to opt for the former. Then, when the stress of work or personal issues came up, people suppressed them, because nobody had time to be held back by trivial upsets. What I saw was a culture of busyness that emerged from people unwilling to face their problems, unable to accept that we were still young adults allowed to feel vulnerable and lost. I saw people establish superficial friendships, too lonely to shut everyone out, but too busy to seek anything more, only perpetuating a cycle of unhealthy coping. I saw a side of campus that wasn’t as orange and bubbly as #princetagram made it seem. It wasn’t until recently that I realized how far I had let myself cruise through my first year at Princeton under this mentality. It was a series of rather regrettable mistakes that made me realize this, but it was a necessary process to force me into reevaluating my values. So I tried new things. I rushed for sororities to push myself outside my comfort zone; I made an effort to reconnect with old friends. I cut down on my commitments. I started to open up to people for the first time, realizing that being open and approachable earned people’s respect, not looking perfectly made up at 4 a.m. It sounds too obvious, and to be honest, a little simplistic, but it was terrifying how long it took me to realize this. The past month I’ve spent opening up to people, I’ve been astonished by not only the number of people who have told me that they were feeling lost and vulnerable, but also who approached me about their issues. Some of the least expected people have become some of my closest friends, and it has made me question how we’d never interacted before. Reaching out has put so many things into perspective, and in the end, made it so much easier to joke about all the stupid things I’d done overcompensating (trust me, anyone who saw me last Saturday night will know what I’m talking about). So before you put this column down, disparaging the past five minutes you’ve wasted, let me refer you to the website Upworthy: People find the most happiness in telling others how much you appreciate them. It’s easy to let yourself be swept away by Princeton, but nothing feels better than reaching out to people and showing how much you care. I think it’s particularly important for underclassmen, and especially freshmen, to realize that there is no shame in feeling lost or lonely; that it’s not necessary to always seem busy and “accomplished.” Who knows whom you may meet making lanterns at 2 a.m. or taking a quick midnight walk. It’s all in the leisure of feeling, and not always doing. We are human, after all.|~|Ye Eun Charlotte Chun is a sophomore from Seoul, South Korea.  She can be reached at ychun@princeton.edu. 
44057|~|You're doing fine|~|   October 8 2013|~|Column | Oct. 8 |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|When I was in elementary school, my class always had these timed multiplication tests — Mad Minutes. They consisted of 100 multiplication problems, and each person had exactly one minute to complete them. Every week, my class had a competition based on these Mad Minutes, and the winner would get a little prize, usually a colorful eraser or something else that third graders find rewarding. I was always mediocre at Mad Minutes, usually finishing in the middle tier of the class, or, on rare occasions, second or third. Either way, I thought I was pretty good at Mad Minutes. When I went home to tell my mom, I would spin the story to aggrandize my performance. I finished Mad Minutes faster than half of the whole class — I was just that good at multiplication. What my mom told me was something that changed the way I viewed myself. She told me to look up. Look up at the other half of the class that was beating me; look up at the heights I could reach if I aspired to achieve what my classmates had achieved. This was a principle I carried in my back pocket, especially throughout high school. There was really no measure of how well I was doing in school or extracurricular activities outside of the context of my peers. As much as we try to evaluate ourselves objectively, it’s impossible to remove ourselves from our circumstances. So most Princeton students, including me, strove to be the best in their schools — whether that meant taking more AP classes than others, winning more sports championships than others or some other measure of success. Even though it wasn’t the most objective method of self-evaluation, it was a pragmatic gauge of how well we were doing. That sort of mindset doesn’t work here at Princeton. Upward comparison doesn’t motivate us anymore; it just hurts. There’s no all-encompassing way to be the best at everything anymore, even if we got close to it in high school. Here, there will always be someone better than you in Latin class, someone else better than you in debate club, someone else who is in the eating club you bickered but didn’t get into. There is no feasible way to “win” the comparison on all fronts because everyone has a leg up over someone else on one front or another. No one at Princeton gets the undisputed title of “best person on campus.” I hear a lot of worry among students that, in comparison to others, they’re not doing enough, well enough or fast enough. I hear a lot of students ask each other what internships they’ve applied to and received offers from in order to make these sorts of comparisons, even though hearing other people’s internship successes doesn’t at all change their own. I hear students ask each other what level classes they’re taking, as if other people’s course decisions should impact their own. This competitive comparison doesn’t benefit anyone. Everybody’s path through college is unique — there is no need to keep up with people who are taking harder classes or getting internships earlier. Upward comparison is prevalent outside of the academic context as well. There’s definitely the sentiment around campus that students should not only be brilliant, but also “well-adjusted” — have tons of friends, go out to all the parties or be active in the eating club and Greek scenes. This is where “fear of missing out” comes in — students see each other’s glamorized pictures on Facebook and feel inadequate about their own social lives. It’s hard to remember that social media is content-edited: People won’t post pictures of themselves doing laundry or homework, but everyone will put up isolated snapshots of the most interesting parts of their lives. The truth is, everyone has days when they just want to stay inside and watch entire seasons of TV shows consecutively on Netflix. That’s normal. It’s just that few people will show that side of themselves on social media, so it just seems like everyone else is hyper-social. I used to think Princeton was asking more of me than I could supply, but, in truth, I was asking the impossible of myself by taking the best bits and pieces of everyone else and holding myself to those standards. Just because comparison was a way to measure progress in high school doesn’t mean it’s a viable or accurate gauge at Princeton. Some of our classmates are physics geniuses, some are world-class chess champions and some just seem to know every single person on campus. We can’t be all of them, all at once, and there’s no reason we have to be. Our only gauge should be ourselves — as long as we’re content with the trajectory we’re taking, we’re doing just fine.|~|Barbara Zhan is a sophomore from Plainsboro, N.J.

44034|~|On loving college (or not)|~|   October 8 2013|~|Column | Oct. 8 |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|The summer after freshman year, I reconvened with my friends from home to rehash details of the first year out of what would supposedly be the greatest four in our lives. We aggressively agreed with each other: Yeah, man, college is the best. It’s so great. I am having so much fun. And then one friend sighed: “Actually, I hate it. I’m thinking of transferring.” There was a silence. For most of us, college had been the shining beacon of hope at the end of the tunnel. It represented unlimited freedom, no parents, no curfews, classes you loved and living 40 feet away from your best friends. After having the idea built up so much, incoming freshmen expect their college experiences to be positively utopian. The idea of not loving college with ever fiber of your being is practically sacrilege. And yet, college is built up so much that it’s arguably impossible for reality to ever measure up to the fantasy. No one ever dreams of the hard parts, though we all subconsciously know that they exist. No one dreams of consecutive all-nighters pulled during midterm week to study for back-to-back exams. No one dreams of being hosed from an a cappella group when you were first-chair alto in your hometown’s regional choir or of living with a roommate who sexiles you four nights out of every week. The thing is, there’s a pretty strong stigma around the idea of being unhappy at college. You are allowed — even encouraged — to feel stressed, annoyed or frustrated, but never for long stretches of time. This might go hand-in-hand with the more overarching stigma that surrounds clinical depression, but I think it reaches further than that. There’s a distinct difference between being depressed and just being unhappy with your college experience. No one wants to admit that they are sad at school, particularly when that school is Princeton and they worked so hard to get here. But the fact that no one wants to admit being down at school gives rise to people pretending to love college, sometimes with a more than average amount of enthusiasm. This causes a sort of chain reaction in which no one thinks anyone else is unhappy, making people even unhappier because they feel like they’re the only ones having feelings of doubt about the Great College Experience. What’s worse is that there’s nothing they can do to change their lives without clueing others into what’s going on. In 2009 the American College Health Association asked students what their number-one cause of unhappiness is in college, and almost 45 percent said it was academic stress. Here at Princeton, everyone graduated at or near the top of their high school classes. While I’d been told many times and objectively knew that college would be much harder, I didn’t actually conceptualize it until I came here and took 8:30 a.m. organic chemistry. That discrepancy — the feeling that you were once a big fish in a small pond and now you’re a tiny one in an ocean — is enough to cause a serious downward spike in emotional well-being. The website Princeton FML often features posts from students lamenting the fact that they let college pass them by. Many feel bad about not enjoying their time here at Princeton, but they only feel comfortable posting about it when the sentiment can’t be traced back to them. Anonymously, almost half of the student population has admitted to feeling sad at school, according to the 2011 COMBO survey. This even led to the formation of a “People Who Blew Princeton” club that anonymously provides support for people who feel as though Princeton passed them by. The thing is, if we’re all more honest about the fact that college isn’t a flawless paradise, there wouldn’t be such a need for secrecy. College is a great time for most people, but not for everyone. The common gripes that many of us brush off resound much more deeply with others and cause a much stronger reaction. To pretend to love college because the alternative is so undesirable is only going to exacerbate the problem.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

44069|~|The rush of rushing|~|   October 8 2013|~|Column | Oct. 8 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Saturday morning, my Facebook feed appeared more like a physics problem set than English, as posts mostly consisted of a wide array of Greek letters. What some may have potentially mistaken for a Facebook language settings malfunction was actually the beginning of sorority pledging. In 2011, Princeton announced its decision to ban freshman affiliations with fraternities and sororities. In her original announcement, former President Shirley Tilghman noted her conviction that “social and residential life at Princeton should continue to revolve around the residential colleges, the eating clubs and the shared experience of essentially all undergraduates living and dining on campus.” In doing so, the University hinted at its opposition to Greek life on campus, highlighting that fraternities and sororities created an atmosphere of “social exclusivity and privilege and socioeconomic stratification among students.” Two years later, however, the Class of 2016’s desire to rush seems unfazed. The question isn’t whether the ban decreased the influence of fraternities or sororities on campus; that clearly isn’t the case. The real question is why. With a whole year for people to build lives and social groups revolving around residential colleges, sports and clubs, why do people still feel the desire to rush? One reason offered is curiosity. As Cuauhtemoc Ocampo ’14, former Sigma Chi president, mentioned in a Daily Princetonian news piece, restricting rush for freshmen may have actually turned Greek life into “a forbidden fruit kind of thing.” Since the option to rush is withheld from freshmen, the next year they “want to know what this organization is about, and so they come in large numbers.” Others suggest that people rush because of their friends, wanting to find a group of like-minded people through Greek life. However, I tend to disagree. There is a reason that we subjected ourselves to the tiring process of Ivy League college applications. There is a reason that we subjected ourselves to the grueling process of tryouts for musical groups, debate teams, comedy groups, club sports or even The Daily Princetonian itself. We like being judged favorably, and one way to measure ourselves is by the exclusivity of what we do. After finishing a full year at Princeton, you realize that Princeton isn’t perfect: There’s stress, lack of sleep and work that you feel completely incapable of accomplishing. The optimistic aura of ivy-clad towers, free food and smart people is replaced by reality. You realize that fitting in or climbing the networking ladder is not only important, but also can be difficult. Now, I’m not saying that everyone is a die-hard social climber or that people don’t do these activities out of legitimate interest in writing, singing or playing a sport. I think that people do. However, there is a reason that a lot of people try out for Fuzzy Dice or Quipfire yet won’t consider joining an alternative, non-tryout improv comedy group like Lobster Club. Students already have so many commitments, yet they are still drawn to the allure of Greek life. It appears that the answer may be positive judgment. Who doesn’t like to be specially chosen among a group of your fellow peers based on your qualities? After all, being prepared for the judgment of others has real applications, such as future job interviews. However, there is a fundamental difference between applying for a job or musical and rushing for Greek life. One is based on your talent. The other is based on your personality. When we value ourselves based on how others judge our personalities, we cross into dangerous territory. The tangible is quickly replaced by the subjective. I’ll admit, nothing is absolutely wrong with forming opinions about others based on personalities. As humans, we unintentionally do it all the time. However, being formally judged is a completely different manner. On campus, we are so obsessed with what clubs we are in, what classes we have taken or what internships we have held, that we overindulge in a gluttonous contest to see who can accumulate the longest, fanciest resume. Because of this, Greek life transforms from a form of brotherhood or sisterhood into an important status symbol. With little cost to rush, it is easy to see why so many are drawn to the race to the top. Exclusivity isn’t necessarily bad, but an indulgence of it is. We should avoid using Greek life merely as a means to boost our social standing. As the rush season comes to an end, we should be careful not to become too concerned about whether we did Greek life or not. It can be fun; it can be disappointing. In the end, though, there is much more to life than the number of Greek letters that fill our Facebook pages.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn.

43833|~|Like a rodent|~|   October 7 2013|~|Column | Oct. 7 |~|Morgan Jerkins|~|None|~|Several times a week, my inbox is flooded with emails from TigerTracks about new opportunities in consulting, trading and investment banking. At first I thought that maybe I had made a mistake when I filled out my profile. Did I accidentally click “computer science” instead of “comparative literature” when I clicked on the drop-down box to list my major? Perhaps I clicked on one of the check-boxes for “consulting” when I really meant to click “communications/media” as one of my career preferences. But when I looked at my profile, I had made no errors. So why was I receiving emails that did not pertain to my interests? After expressing my opinions to friends, I realized that I wasn’t the only one who felt a little bit peeved about these emails. According to PolicyMic, in 2011 about 35 percent of Princeton students went into finance, which proves that the industry is booming.  The top investment banking companies come to Princeton and Harvard first to recruit students, and these emails are used to spread the word in order to prepare for the early recruitment and interviewing process. And I’m not suggesting that no one in the humanities goes into these types of job sectors. They do. But when I rarely see email alerts about arts companies, I cannot help but wonder if I, and many others who made sure to detail their preferences on TigerTracks, are being ignored. As mentioned earlier, I understand that the recruitment process for finance companies starts very early in the year. Students dress in their best professional attire and head to Frist 302 to hear from employers, chat with them afterward and eat good food. Career Services tries to create a balance with these events; for example, it organizes the annual Communications Careers & Networking Night. Looking at the description for the event, it is noted that these types of companies do not often recruit on campus. But why not? Those handling TigerTracks should count the students whose interests include the arts, editorials, writing, et cetera, so that they can use these statistics to attract companies from these particular job sectors to come to campus in order to recruit people. If Career Services targets students who participate in the Nassau Literary Review, the Nassau Weekly, The Daily Princetonian, creative writing classes and the countless theater groups, I can almost guarantee that you will find enough students to fill Dillon Gymnasium for a career fair that is specifically aimed at those who are interested in the arts. This will encourage companies from these sectors to network more with students. The demand is already there. The Freelance Artist’s Manifesto Boot Camp is another excellent example of an initiative hosted by Theatre Intime for those who are artistically inclined. But what about those artists who do not want to be freelance?  There are countless ways in which an artistic person can channel his or her skills, both in traditional and unconventional paths. For instance, NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts or the University of Iowa’s Writers’ Workshop could hold information sessions here. These options do exist, but we need access to them. I have noticed that there are a few companies, such as those in translation, with deadlines that passed a few short days ago. What if reminders were sent about those opportunities? Since foreign language study is required for two years at Princeton and there are plenty of students who go beyond the requirement, these types of students should be catered to as well. Do you know how many Princetonians speak French? Searching for jobs is a stressful topic for all seniors, but the process would be less overwhelming with balanced support from Career Services. Yes, finance students should be especially cognizant of deadlines and information sessions because the recruitment processes are early and tend to finish rather quickly. That doesn’t mean that the entire student community should be flooded with these emails, especially when we have never listed these career preferences. Instead, those who tend to fall on the artistic side should be informed and reminded about upcoming deadlines for other companies. Check out BuzzFeed (which was started by a Princeton alumnus, might I add) — there is a job opening this instant as a books editor. Many Princeton students on Facebook are constantly tuned into these websites. If Career Services could consolidate some of this information and send emails, perhaps others like me wouldn’t feel so left out.

43830|~|Finding that special something|~|   October 7 2013|~|Column | Oct. 7 |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|Before first arriving on Princeton’s campus last fall, I had subconsciously created a checklist with a million and one expectations for my four years here — meeting amazing people that I’d call friends for life, or discussing Thoreau under an oak tree. I admit that this isn’t the smartest thing to do, but with so many people telling me how amazing and life changing college would be, how could I not anticipate these experiences I was told were supposed to be happening? For the most part, a good chunk of these expectations have been met or will be. But one important one, one that is a bit more time-sensitive, has yet to occur. I am, of course, talking about finding the love of my life. I think I’m most disappointed that this hasn’t happened yet because it was the moment I could so vividly picture in my mind: I realize there are hundreds of options around me. I’m weighing them all, trying to be as rational as possible, when out of nowhere, my attention is grabbed. This one stands out from all the rest. I begin questioning everything I once thought I wanted, my goals and dreams have changed before my very eyes, and I can feel it in the core of my being that I have been permanently changed. Yes, I signed up for the ride, but I didn’t know it would take me to this terrifying, amazing place where I question everything I’ve ever thought about myself and my place in the world. This is what the moment of finding my academic passion would be like, or so I imagine. But in the past year I’ve been at Princeton, I have yet to find that one course by that one amazing professor which has hit me like a ton of bricks in signifying what I’m meant to do with my life. Don’t get me wrong; I know which areas of study are most interesting to me. When applying, the greatest allure of Princeton was the Wilson School. The idea of policy, creating effective change through analyzing all the results of the past, circumstances in the present and ramifications in the future, interests me because it is a conglomeration of so many areas of study. And I know that I want to help underserved communities, both in the United States and internationally. I want to be “in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations,” and I find even knowing this is a blessing. But the romantic in me is simply waiting for a course to sweep me off my feet. Because even though I know I’m interested in policy, there are a million angles from which it can be approached. Moreover, even knowing I’m interested in international affairs and am planning to concentrate in Woody Woo, I’m left feeling strangely wary. I wonder if I’m choosing such a major because I think it’s safer than others that interest me, like English or Spanish and Portuguese languages and culture. I also wonder about the other possible paths I could take to achieve the end goal of helping underserved peoples — there are other available majors like sociology, or I could even study something completely different and find my way to the non-profit sector later in life. Finally, I think on what my AP Psychology teacher in high school once told me, about how life’s possibilities for each of us are virtually endless.  To keep our minds from being overwhelmed, he said, we tidily box ourselves into categories while rejecting all others. The idea of “one seminar to rule them all” changes then. It becomes less quixotic and acts more as a safety mechanism. You’ve encountered what you think to be your professional destiny. Thus, you can convince yourself that, after experiencing such a drastic alteration in your expected course, you’ve finally figured it all out. Some of the best advice I’ve ever gotten relevant to this was over coffee with a friend and an awesome grad student we had sought out for a chat. He said, “Many people in Princeton are so concerned with the ‘what.’ And once they figure that out, they start creating a million different ‘hows.’ But I think the best thing you can do is know ‘why.’ If you know why you’re doing what you are, it all falls into place so much easier.” I may not know what I’m doing at Princeton or beyond. But I firmly believe in the why — “in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations”—and that will be enough for now.|~|Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La.

43851|~|Unless there's consent|~|   October 7 2013|~|Column | Oct. 7 |~|Spencer Shen|~|None|~|AlcoholEdu has been part of Princeton’s smorgasbord of freshman orientation activities for several years, but this year the Class of 2017 had an additional online course to take before they set foot on campus. “Unless There’s Consent,” a program designed by SHARE to educate incoming freshmen on sexual harassment and abuse, is well-intentioned. Last year, when the results of a 2008 survey revealed that around 15 percent of female undergraduate students at Princeton had experienced “non-consensual vaginal penetration” during their four years here, there was anger, there was misanthropy and there was plenty of debate over what the administration could do to bring that number closer to zero. As of now, only the freshmen have taken “Unless There’s Consent” and there have only been five weekends for them to apply its lessons, so it isn’t really possible to gauge its effectiveness with hard data yet. However, it isn’t difficult to see how the program could have been created as a knee-jerk reaction to the uproar surrounding the survey’s results, instead of a long-term solution to a perennial problem. For a good comparison, all we have to do is take a look at the effectiveness of AlcoholEdu. It might have some effect on how students choose to drink, and it’s hard to know what Princeton’s party scene would be like without AlcoholEdu. However, what we do know is that the kind of drinking that AlcoholEdu warns against occurs almost every Thursday and Saturday night, in rooms all over campus. AlcoholEdu might not be useless — it might be cutting the number of McCosh’d and PMC’d students in half for all we know — but it certainly isn’t effective enough to prevent the high-risk behavior it tries to discourage. The unfortunate reality is that there probably isn’t actually a way to completely suppress any student body’s tendency towards overdrinking, and the same is possibly true of sexual harassment. Like AlcoholEdu, “Unless There’s Consent” is a step in the right direction, as it represents at least a superficial investment in reducing the amount of sexual harassment and abuse that happens on campus. However, if the Princeton administration wants to be serious about preventing “non-consensual vaginal penetration” and similar behaviors, it needs to be willing to change the culture surrounding the Street, hookups, drinking and other smaller factors that contribute to the 15 percent figure, which many of us have already pushed to the back of our minds. However, the issues that AlcoholEdu and “Unless There’s Consent” intend to tackle are problems at almost all colleges in the United Staes, so it is unlikely that Princeton’s administration can prevent its students from essentially behaving like typical college students. The root cause of the problem lies in the inability of an administration to change decades of accumulated “college culture” that revolves around drinking and sex, among other things. The same phenomenon happens with programs such as D.A.R.E. in middle schools and high schools, which does little to discourage students who are already using drugs from doing what they want. Many students have already been told what’s cool and what’s not cool by other students and popular culture, and no amount of AlcoholEdu-like initiatives is going to affect those perceptions once they’ve been made. The few colleges in the United States that have dry campuses don’t achieve that through any kind of administrative influence on the students; it is the students who actively accept a ban on alcohol and drugs. Whether Princeton’s administration tries strict rules and harsh punishments, like the Honor Code, or passive educational initiatives like AlcoholEdu (and presumably “Unless There’s Consent”), it cannot actually alter students’ behavior significantly unless there’s consent from the students, so to speak. If even the legal ramifications of underage drinking or sexual assault can’t discourage students from engaging in those behaviors, then the administration has no hope of doing so either. For all the talk of consent and respect, a campus culture which embraces partying and drinking will inevitably result in some occurrences of “non-consensual vaginal penetration.” By going to the Street or a pregame, a student implicitly supports and accepts the same “college culture” that also spawned the idea of date rape. If we really want to prevent these situations from occurring, then we would need to reform the entire campus culture — the eating clubs wouldn’t hold any more parties, dorms would have to be substance-free and single-sex, and so on, with PSafe (or even the Princeton police!) strictly enforcing those rules. These might be extreme measures, but that’s what it would take for Princeton to truly prevent sexual harassment, non-consensual situations, high-risk drinking or anything else that is exacerbated by a party culture.|~|Spencer Shen is a sophomore from Austin, Texas.

42948|~|Career fair competition|~|   October 6 2013|~|Column | Oct. 6 |~|Jason Choe|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|The two words “career fair” shined in a golden light; they were alluring, magical words that carried the promise of internships and job opportunities galore. Unfortunately, there seems to be a pervading mentality that dictates that summer vacation is only a vacation in name and that, in order to build up a resume, students simply have to land a position with some big, reputable firm. Upon arriving at Princeton, I, and many others, I suspect, have come to believe that to be the truth, despite the fact that we of the great Class of 2017 will not be on the active job market for another four long years. Regardless, the chance to see exactly what employers look for in a candidate was too interesting a prospect to miss — that, and the fact that most booths usually give out freebies, convinced me to attend. When I spoke with the representatives myself, I generally tried to convey that I was a freshman as soon as I could. I’m not sure what I was expecting — perhaps some part of me naively hoped that the reps would appreciate the enterprising and adventurous nature of a member of Princeton’s youngest class trying to make a name for himself. Instead, most looked at me with a smile that wasn’t really a smile and an expression that conveyed a disguised look of pity. They often mentioned something along the lines of “Oh, that’s nice! Unfortunately, we are looking more for juniors, or maybe sophomores. But feel free to apply next year!” The rationale behind the brusque dismissal was quite simple. Most freshmen lack any real specialization, as they are, for the most part, taking introductory classes and trying to fulfill their course distribution requirements. Why would anyone even consider a “prospective” economics major still taking ECO 101: Introduction to Macroeconomics, when there are so many more qualified upperclassmen out there vying for the same position, upperclassmen currently taking courses such as ECO 519: Advanced Econometrics, Nonlinear Models? While it is logical for employers to prefer experienced students, what’s so wrong with freshmen (and indeed, students in general) trying to gain experience, valuable experience, in fields that interest them? The career fair brought up an interesting oxymoron — on the one hand, employers attend career fairs such as the one last month in order to attract and entice promising students, students who attend a world-renowned educational institution known for encouraging intellectual risks and for promoting an active exploration of a variety of subjects (why else would the distribution requirements exist?). On the other hand, in order to obtain a job or an internship, students need to be specialized — they need to have tailored skill sets and well-developed proficiency in the field that they hope to get into. Want work at Colgate? What experience do you have in chemical engineering? Want to work with Dropbox? Show us some of the past software projects you’ve developed or designed. It’s the classic bait-and-switch. Promise one thing — that there’s a position, a spot, a special seat for everyone — then reveal the reality: There’s only a job for students who are already experts. This raises an interesting dilemma. People are not struck with sudden epiphanies regarding what they want to spend the rest of their lives doing; they don’t wake up in the middle of the night with the revelation that they want to be cardiac surgeons or software engineers or literary critics. Rather, it is a gradual process, a process of discovery, through which people come to realize where their interests lie. A variety of studies have shown that hands-on experience is often the best way to learn and foster interest — after actively working in a field, it is much easier to decide if that field resonates or not. Yet in order to enter any specific field, students first need to be experts even before they apply for the job. Where’s the learning curve? The experimentation period? It seems that in this increasingly competitive world, expertise is a prerequisite for success, which is not a positive change. The need for specialization leaves students with an ultimatum of sorts: restrict yourselves to a single area of study and become “experts,” or else don’t get that internship or that position. Maybe it’s time for employers to change their mindsets and to start considering qualifications other than pure expertise; qualifications such as a holistic educational background that covers a broad swath of subjects and areas, an education that renders a student not necessarily an expert, but rather someone capable of creative and constructive thought. After all, capability comes in many forms.|~|Jason Choe is a freshman from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. He can be reached at jasonjc@princeton.edu.

42888|~|Editorial: Don't expand|~|   October 6 2013|~|Editorial | Oct. 6 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Last week, Yale University announced the receipt of a major donation that would help it build two new residential colleges and increase the student body by about 15% to a total of over 6000 undergraduates. The next day, President Eisgruber suggested increasing Princeton’s undergraduate student body at a Council of Princeton University Community meeting. This would be a bad idea. Princeton has traditionally been a high-powered liberal arts university with a modestly larger student body than other such institutions. Increasing the student body further would damage Princeton’s tradition of excellence. As a liberal arts university, one of Princeton’s trademarks is a remarkably low student-to-faculty ratio (currently, 6:1). This ensures robust student-faculty interaction and generally smaller class sizes, resulting in a unique learning environment. Increasing the student body without a commensurate increase in highly qualified professors would endanger one of Princeton’s unique attributes. Increasing the faculty and resources of the University proportionally to a student body expansion would be expensive. Were it not for a recent $250 million pledge, Yale University would be facing a steep $330 million price tag for the construction of its two new residential colleges alone — to say nothing of costs for hiring new faculty, constructing new academic and administrative facilities or other unforeseen expenses. Coincidentally, Princeton is already engaged in shelling out in excess of $300 million for the new Arts and Transit Neighborhood currently in the works. Perhaps we should see this project to completion before contemplating incredibly expensive proposals. But let us suppose that even the large costs could be easily reckoned with. After all, Princeton does have generous alumni and the highest endowment-to-student ratio of any university worldwide (in 2013, it stands at $1,857,040 per student). Still, that does not change the fact that more students means less individual attention. Moreover, an increase in the student body could detrimentally alter the Princetonian social atmosphere. For one thing, it’s hard to say how an increase in the student body would impact the eating clubs, as well as the campus Greek life situation. Furthermore, as things stand, Princeton is fairly tight-knit.  The smallish student body provides for a greater sense of community.  Beyond the mere abstraction of “community,” a small student body has the practical effect of making it more likely to encounter friends around campus and know more of one’s class. Larger class sizes are less apt to provide these positive facets of Princeton’s social atmosphere. Over the years, Princeton has grown from a small college of Presbyterian ministers-in-training to a full-blown research university built on a liberal-arts foundation. Growth often came in sudden spurts — from the great expansion of 1896 when Princeton College became Princeton University to the introduction of coeducation in 1969. Yet its distribution over the years was gradual, and, it is important to note, Princeton recently did expand by 10 percent with the completion of Whitman College in 2007. Given this recent growth spurt, it seems premature to begin formulating plans to expand once again so shortly afterward. In sum, the Board believes that expanding Princeton’s student body would not be in the interest of maintaining the University’s unique character. Arguing in favor of Princeton’s current size is no argument for harboring a superior sense of exclusivity; rather, it is simply an argument for preserving Princeton as the unique and excellent university that it has come to be. Besides, we wouldn’t want to go down the same road as Yale.|~|
42945|~|Weighing your options|~|   October 6 2013|~|Column | Oct. 6 |~|James Di Palma-Grisi|~|   Columnist     |~|One of the stranger things about how students handle course selection is the avoidance of the pass/D/fail option. Perspectives differ, but one attitude is that using P/D/Fs, specifically those not used in a strategic manner to fulfill course requirements, is detrimental. Equally a function of the large-lecture format and the general-education focus, introductory courses are typically the vehicle for distribution requirements. Notwithstanding the parity of courses toward the degree requirement of 31 for A.B. students, why not take as many courses for a grade as possible? There are some reasons to use a P/D/F option, such as forgoing an introductory lecture course in favor of an advanced lecture or seminar course on a more interesting topic without the risk of getting a bad grade. Holistic education is the prerogative for the elective, designed to bring students outside the comfort zones created by concentrated study. Even though someone might benefit from the introductory course, taking advanced courses with the P/D/F option might confer a greater benefit. Deemed essential for the cultivation of flexible thinking, electives prompt different ways of interpreting the world. One ought to dwell on this last point. Often, advanced courses outside one’s concentration require a significant amount of background reading, which can deter people from considering them. Reasonably conservative people can use their P/D/F options after concentrating in their field of interest and later branch into similar fields at a higher-than-intro level. Grading is considered harsh in most courses, and there is evidence that low marks make admission into business school less likely, regardless of the quality of the institution. Even for other graduate schools, the assumption is that it is detrimental. Too often, we retreat to the comfort of courses we know to be within ourselves, defeating the purpose of the distribution requirements. One argument is that people simply wouldn’t want to spend time studying for a course for which they will not be graded. Noble though misplaced lines of thought say that one should place all of one’s effort into courses directly relevant to the concentration, with the assumption that strenuous mental activity for the vague concept of broadening horizons would be frivolous. Therefore, the risk-averse strategy of taking courses within one’s comfort level, whether based on the content or the introductory format, is common. However one allocates distribution requirements, the ultimate purpose of them is to provoke critical thought using different paradigms. Even if one doesn’t have a full command of the entire field, there are often options only slightly more complex than the introductory-course level. For all the individual arguments, there is a trade-off to be made. Leaving aside the problem of course topic, we can look at level and grading option. One trade-off is that between workload and how rewarding the course would be. Overarching time constraints and background are also valid considerations. Reiterating an earlier argument, the complexity of specific courses is most rewarding once comfortable with the course format, assignments, etc. Even considering this, there is a conflict between having the maximum amount of experience in a particular concentration and the cognitive benefit one might gain. Valuing the two can be complicated. Excess courses past the necessary 31 are one avenue, and P/D/F options can be incorporated into demanding schedules. Beneficial as they may be, one might look toward courses similar to one’s own expertise. Often, this results in silos, isolated areas of knowledge broadly ignorant to the outside world. Depth is essential, and it seems intuitive that depth in a secondary field is helpful. You ultimately will be the judge of how cordoned off your particular set of expertise is or isn’t. With that in mind, we should examine the critical process of actually choosing courses. Alternatives can be valued by potential impact on overall grades, workload, topics, etc. Looking at individual conditions would help us figure out which options seem more appealing. Knack for an individual topic should be considered, since this will motivate regardless of grading option. Three options remain. Heretofore the most common is to take the easiest course available for a grade, though alternatives include taking the most rewarding for a grade, switching to a P/D/F option if necessary and adding on additional courses with the P/D/F option. Each has its merits, but the third especially so. Doubtless there are personal details that inform each decision. Indeed, someone with an excess of courses might find the decision much easier in general. Nor should we oversimplify by focusing only on the particular circumstances of individual students. Often, there are valuable generalizations to be made regarding the decision process that might apply to many cases. Significant among these is the value to the student. Academic exploration is viewed favorably by hiring and admission officers. Universal advice is difficult to extrapolate, but one may gain more from a P/D/F-optioned course early in one’s academic career rather than waiting until later, when paradigms are more fixed in the student’s mind. Revising the grading option to P/D/F is possible, but one can’t retroactively broaden an education.|~|James Di Palma-Grisi  is a psychology major from Glen Rock, N.J.

42714|~|The effects of divestment|~|   October 3 2013|~|Column | Oct. 3 |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|Oil and gas companies are sufficiently large and profitable that Princeton’s individual environmental divestment efforts will not make a monetary difference. Energy is a $6 trillion global market; America is a third of that total. Gas companies are naturally pro status quo as they want these vast revenues to continue. If divestment is a good, important or actionable cause, it cannot be about hurting the pocketbooks of energy companies. The proposed effort to extract Princeton’s endowment money from fossil fuel companies is interesting in that it is a moral issue, but it is not immediately clear what good its success will do. In some ways divestment will work to promote a certain level of discourse among the University students, professors and administrators. That is good.  Perhaps this effort can inspire the divestment of other university endowments, which, in aggregate, might get the attention of the oil (and gas and coal) companies to branch out into renewable energy. Perhaps there is also an argument to be made that divesting the endowment is an effort to promote profitable investing, that is, divestment should be considered not because it promotes a social good, but because oil and gas themselves are bad investments. If that is the case, there is a twofold good in divestment, healthy environmental discourse (leading to eventual action) and long-term investing savvy. Princeton will likely be around for a while longer while oil and gas consumption, in the long run, might decrease and eventually cease. Unfortunately (for the cause of divestment), the endowment is comprised of thousands of gifts to capital from various donors, each of which comes with very specific stipulations. There is no perfect autonomy on the part of the endowment investors to make decisions. The money has strings attached. A substantial gift might be given specifically to paleontology research in Latin America — the University does not have unfettered control of the money. There are significant holdings in energy companies; it would be costly and nearly impossible to divest. Also, when the University gives money to investment funds, it is tough to ask the fund managers to take out specific aspects (in this case the ones related to fossil fuel) of their portfolios, and so divestment is difficult. Importantly, decisions that Princeton makes have an enormous impact on the Princeton community and less on the world at large. If some of the investments are done poorly, then Princetonians suffer and fewer people get financial aid. It is important that actions taken are in the best interests of the students — by making money for the University, and that should not be sacrificed for some political statement. In fact, according to the ethicist Peter Singer: “There is an important ethical framework to invest funds wisely for a high return over a long term for the student’s best interests.” There are, however, other ethical constraints that are relevant to the fossil fuel industry — it is important that companies endeavor to do as little harm as possible. The Rawlsian principle holds: Those who are better off should not make those who are worse off suffer. The wealthy will indeed suffer harms due to global warming, but the poor will suffer more. Divestment from oil and gas set potentially negative precedents for the health of the endowment. If the University starts divesting from fossil fuels, what are the next demands going to be? If a student group takes up the cause of divestment from companies that support obesity, will the University have to take that into consideration? All companies do some form of harm, and this leads to a snowball effect of disallowing the University from making sound investments. Princeton might end up not being able to invest in the economy appropriately. It is important not to set a precedent that ties the University’s hands in the future. Also there are a host of unintended consequences in divesting from fossil fuel companies — Exxon makes water pipelines and brings food supplies to offshore drillsmen — could Princeton divestment jeopardize those sorts of efforts, especially if other institutions follow suit? Ultimately it seems that divestment is important not because it will have tremendous concrete effects, but rather because it makes people take notice — which could eventually do good. Princeton’s actions have the potential to cause larger effects. Perhaps divestment could target coal companies exclusively. That way the University sends a message, but draws a distinct line. Divestment does not work to alter personal human behaviors — individuals will continue to use fossil fuels every day. It has become clear to me that this is about image, more than tangible effects. Perhaps it would do more environmental good to encourage other more direct behavioral measures than it would to divest Princeton’s endowment. Divestment is purely symbolic. Perhaps it is nonetheless worth it.|~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif.  He can be reached at applbaum@princeton.edu.

42711|~|Don't shut down the student vote|~|   October 3 2013|~|Column | Oct. 3 |~|Marni Morse|~|None|~|New Jersey might not hold as much sway as North Carolina in the national electoral balance, but we do have our fair share of interesting elections. In addition to the statewide elections in November, we will have the special election for the open U.S. Senate seat on Oct. 16, less than a month away. But what if you showed up at your polling place on campus and could not vote? Luckily, that will not happen this fall at Princeton, assuming you meet a few basic requirements. But 33 states around the United States have already changed their electoral laws to increase voting eligibility requirements, with many of these new laws wrongly targeting students and preventing them from easily voting. A new North Carolina law will end same-day registration and require voters to show government-issued IDs to vote; a college ID will not suffice as proper identification. The bill also reduces the early voting period and removes preregistration for high school students. While in 1979 the Supreme Court determined that students are allowed to vote where they attend college, most students do not switch their driver’s license to their new state of residence and therefore won’t be able to vote. Essentially this new law and other related laws restrict the youth vote by making it more difficult for students to get registered. And when students are busy with class and extracurricular activities, they cannot always make the added effort needed to meet these new more stringent requirements to be eligible to vote. Unfortunately, this means that students can still be taken advantage of by laws like HB-589, because if they are not voting, those in power might not have students’ best interests at heart. Students can and should fight back by ensuring that they and their peers meet these new standards so that they can have a voice in upcoming elections. At some level, it may be true that students are abnegating their civil responsibility by being apathetic; however, the government’s goal should not be to make students jump through more hoops in order to vote. Politicians should be ensuring our government truly is by the people and for the people by ensuring that voting is easily accessible to all. This is why the Department of Justice announced that it is suing North Carolina for violating voting rights. Theoretically, these new restrictions could reduce voting fraud, a perfectly valid goal. However, no material voting fraud has occurred in North Carolina or in other states that have enacted similar laws. Because of these inconsistencies, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit challenging a Texas voter identification law. In Texas, a license to carry a concealed handgun is adequate documentation to vote, but somehow a college ID is not. The true motive behind the North Carolina bill appears to be partisan. North Carolina has a Republican-controlled state legislature, and the new law targets student voters (among others), a demographic likely to vote Democratic. According to “The Huffington Post,” the HB-589 bill was “GOP-backed.” Diana Kasdan, senior counsel at the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, told the Chronicle of Higher Education, “It’s clearly targeting student voters. They tend to vote Democratic, and it’s a Republican-controlled state legislature that passed it.” Concerns that the younger generation tends to vote Democratic have some statistical foundation. Even though former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in 2012, won North Carolina, two-thirds of voters under the age of 30 voted Democratic. There is no denying that the large number of college students voting could potentially affect certain election results, but that does not mean youth votes can be silenced. “The Washington Post” reported that President Obama won at least 60 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 in both the 2008 and 2012 election cycles. But the statistics reveal a more significant disparity. Only 41 percent of eligible voters from ages 18-24 voted in the 2012 presidential election per the most recent Census Bureau report. This was a decrease from youth turnout in the 2008 election and the lowest turnout rate among any age group. Rather than each political party looking out for their own interests and candidates, they should join together in a bipartisan effort to increase voter turnout in all age groups and across political parties. In Frist, the campus Republicans, Democrats and P-Votes, a nonpartisan organization, worked together in September to register students to vote in New Jersey. Here, voter participation comes first, and party comes second. Legislators around the nation would do well to follow this example. So, when you vote in a few weeks, just make sure you switched to vote in New Jersey and that you are a U.S. citizen over 18. You also must have been living in Mercer County for 30 days. But luckily for you, by the time elections come around you will have been staying up late and writing papers for at least that long. Oh, and try not be a convicted felon!

42725|~|Editorial: Allow transfer students|~|   October 3 2013|~|Editorial | Oct. 3 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Princeton has not admitted undergraduate transfer students since 1990. The admission office credits this decision to the 98 percent retention rate and the burden of an increasingly large volume of applications. In a solely economic sense, it is understandable that the University considers it a poor use of resources to make strained admission officers evaluate a large number of applicants for 20 or fewer spots. But the Editorial Board believes that Princeton’s institutional values provide reason to admit transfer students. Allowing transfers, if done the right way, would open up spots to non-traditional students and enrich the student body with different life experiences. Transfer admissions should not primarily seek to admit dissatisfied Ivy Leaguers; instead, like those of many of our peer schools, they should focus on students with diverse backgrounds, such as community college students, that would add different perspectives to our campus. Amherst, for example, reserves half of their transfer student spots for community college applicants. While Princeton does have a duty to admit the most qualified applicants, the admission office would likely receive enough applications to fill the few spots without compromising quality.  Yale receives 1,000 applications for 20 to 30 transfer spots and Harvard receives 1,500 for 15 spots.  Princeton could expect to receive a similar number of applications, proportional to the size of our student body.  Further, transfer applications would contain two key evaluative tools: a college grade point average and an essay explaining the applicants desire to transfer. A college GPA is likely a better indicator of future college performance than a high school GPA. The essay would enable admissions officers to select applicants who would truly bring diversity to campus that could not be found in the regular applicant pool, making the process worthwhile. In addition to Princeton’s duty to select a qualified and diverse applicant pool, it also has a duty to serve the public good. The motto “in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations” invokes duty not just from individual Princetonians but also from the institution. Further bolstering this obligation is the fact that Princeton receives $54,000 per student in federal aid (while a public university up the road, The College of New Jersey, receives only $1,600 per student in federal aid). A Princeton education can be impetus for success and social mobility; if even one undergraduate spot is open, Princeton ought to take measures to ensure that it is filled. Recognizing the distinctiveness and rigor of a Princeton education, the Board recommends transfer admission be restricted to those entering into the freshman or sophomore class. Currently, Princeton considers anyone ever enrolled in a full-time degree program a transfer applicant — disallowing those who started a community college or another university, even for just a semester, from applying as freshmen. The Board urges the Office of Admission to revoke this requirement, as it would increase the diversity of applications to the freshman class.  Those who completed a year of school should apply as transfers into the sophomore class, though there should be some flexibility and discretion from the admission office. While we certainly do not believe that transfer spots should be restricted solely to applicants from community colleges, we believe that applicants from these schools could be compelling candidates. Anyone who has completed a post secondary degree, however, should not be allowed to apply for admission, as is current policy. Having students come to Princeton for a second B.A., would adversely affect the virtue of the learning and living community. Further, upperclassmen transfers should not be accepted because after the first two years it would be difficult, if not impossible, to complete independent work and departmental and course distribution requirements. The Board stresses that diversification should remain the goal of any change to the transfer policy.  All in all, if our peer institutions can enhance their student bodies and individual lives with transfer admissions, then we can more than likely successfully engage in similar efforts.|~|
42486|~|Open letter of appreciation to Dean Russel|~|   October 2 2013|~|Column | Oct. 2 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|The Graduate Student Government was saddened to hear of the upcoming retirement of Dean Russel, who has served as dean of the Graduate School for 11 years. Since he took up the office of dean in 2002, Dean Russel has worked closely and tirelessly with the GSG in pursuit of improving the graduate student experience at Princeton University. In a retrospective look back on Dean Russel’s career and influence, the current GSG Executive Board reached out to former GSG chairs and presidents to recall their experience with Dean Russel. Leslie Medema MPA ’04, GSG chair from 2003-04, fondly remembered working with Dean Russel as chair of the GSG and as a member of the CPUC Priorities Committee. She recalls learning “a tremendous amount from those processes and how he handled advocating for the Graduate School while balancing the many priorities of the school,” noting the difficulty such a position holds — particularly when “emotions flared on our end.” Leslie wishes Dean Russel “much rest and grand adventures” in his retirement, thanking him “for all he has done for the graduate programs and for Princeton University.” Dr. Shin-Yi Lin ’11, GSG chair from 2005-08, would like to thank Dean Russel for “being such a passionate advocate for our graduate students,” and for appreciating “the professionalism and respect with which he consistently interacted with student leaders.” She notes how lucky she was to “get an insider’s view of how aggressively he advocated for graduate students behind the scenes,” a view almost at odds with his reserved public persona. During her time with the GSG, Shin-Yi worked with Dean Russel on many critical reforms — particularly “replacing DCC/ET-DCC with DCE status, providing family-friendly benefits (reducing the cost of dependent coverage, formalizing a parental leave policy and providing child-care subsidies), improving the diversity of our student body and expanding funding for social events.” Dean Russel was also “instrumental” in helping launch the Princeton Research Symposium in 2004, which Shin-Yi is “happy to see continues today as an annual event for the University community.” Finally, she would like to personally thank Dean Russel and his wife Priscilla for the “warmth and kindness” they showed her, her husband Matt Weber ’09 and their growing family both “throughout my time at Princeton, and afterwards since we’ve joined the alumni community.” Shin-Yi wishes Dean Russel all the best as he wraps up his time as dean of the Graduate School! Kevin Smith MPA ’12, GSG president from 2011-12, was honored to work alongside Dean Russel on behalf of the graduate student body and encouraged by Dean Russel’s “steadfast work ethic and his focus on improving the graduate student experience both inside and outside the classroom.” All this and more support the sentiment that Dean Russel is, in the words of former GSG President (2012-13) Chad Maisel MPA ’13, a “terrific advocate” for graduate students and the GSG alike. During Dean Russel’s 11 years of tenure, the graduate school has broadened its reach to improve graduate student well-being — for instance, by sponsoring and co-sponsoring dozens of social events each year. In recent years, Dean Russel has continued his active involvement with the GSG as a guest at both our Assembly and Executive Board meetings. In addition, he was influential in last year’s change to the Open Access Dissertation policy, which gives graduate students more control over when their dissertation becomes available online and thereby benefits those who seek to publish a book on their dissertation topic. The current GSG looks upon Dean Russel’s retirement as a loss of a valued advocate, but also looks forward to fostering a similar relationship with his successor — who faces great shoes to fill. Dean Russel has continually shown care and concern for the views of graduate students and true interest in improving the graduate student experience. We will miss him and his genuine interest in the success of graduate students and his continued open door. On behalf of Princeton graduate students — past, present and future — the GSG wishes Dean Russel the very best in his retirement. Dean Russel, we thank you very much for your years of service and dedication to the graduate students!

42478|~|Very Princeton|~|   October 2 2013|~|Column | Oct. 2 |~|Mitchell Hammer|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|As I poured myself some water at the reception for President Eisgruber’s installation, the clink of the ice cubes tumbling into my glass vaguely upset me in some unidentifiable way.  It wasn’t until after I strode back to my friends on the lawn and saw identical glasses in their hands that I realized that what I’d felt was a sense of surprise: At an outdoor venue with a large number of people in attendance, I was used to plastic cups, not glass ones, and I was wholly unprepared to find myself drinking from the latter. I’ve only spent a few weeks on campus as a freshman, but already there are times I catch myself wondering whether this is real-life or a movie set. The incident concerning the glass is just one occasion where the amount of luxury we enjoy at Princeton shatters normal university standards and then some. There has been free food once to twice a day since I moved into my dorm room; the U-Store has sections devoted to Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers; we place our full trash cans outside our doors at night and then, magically, they’re empty the next day; the “port-a-potty” I used at the Grace Potter and the Nocturnals show not only had flushing toilets and running water, but also was complemented by an automatic paper-towel dispenser. It’s all very Princeton. But that’s exactly the crux of my initial experience here. Before I came, I knew the Princeton that pop culture and Hollywood portrayed: a school of genius and privilege, whose students wore sweaters draped across their shoulders and enjoyed life in the lap of luxury despite their difficult studies. However, I did not expect for this stereotype of wealth and indulgence to be true; it was too Princeton. I found it incompatible with the 21st century. Yet I realized, especially after witnessing us all in perfect Hollywood-prep for Lawnparties (if we’re honest with ourselves, we know our Lawnparties’ outfits are only half-joking), that preconceptions were not misconceptions. Even with Lawnparties over, I can’t help but notice that a conspicuous part of the student body’s wardrobe is made up of the exact outfits used to parody the school; the amount of salmon-colored shorts and pastel polos didn’t change all that much from pre- to post-event. Princeton embodies its own caricature. I’m sure the situation is the same at other schools in the Ivy League with similarly large endowments, but I still find the pageantry with which every event is carried out almost comical. Not laughable, but amusing by the mere virtue of the fact that the real Princeton is so ironically un-ironic. Where one expects custom-built stages for administrative inaugurations or a street lined with student-owned mansions, one finds exactly that. I personally enjoy the roll-of-the-eyes my parents give me when I relay to them the latest Princeton-esque quirk I’ve discovered on campus, an eye-roll that says, “Of course Princeton would do that.” Despite perhaps appearing to the contrary, this is by no means a critical commentary. Instead, I am simply illustrating (and poking just a little bit of fun at) the goings-on on campus that I think some more seasoned Princetonians have become accustomed to and may take for granted. We are blessed to attend not only one of the premier research universities in the world, but also one that can accommodate its student body with such a broad array of amenities. I’ve already seen Princeton utilize its resources (namely its $17 billion endowment) to support and develop the abilities of its students in ways I never imagined possible at an undergraduate institution. And while it is true that Princeton could turn more of its attention away from campus, I believe that Princeton’s (and for that matter any higher learning institution’s) main focus should be its students. Princeton is furnished with an incredible financial-aid system, accomplished faculty and the most contemporary facilities and equipment available, all to provide the best to its students. If we get a few extra pats on the back than most universities students do in the process, I say so be it. Princeton does not aim to be just a college — it is an experience. Students learn from their friends and their extracurriculars just as much as they do from their professors, becoming well-rounded and productive citizens and thereby ensuring the reputation and longevity of the University for another generation. At the end of the day, I think that most everything the University does is with its students in mind, even those things that make me question whether I’m really attending college or if I’m actually on the collegiate version of “The Truman Show.” But I find I only ask myself this because I’m still unused to the amount of resources Princeton sets aside for its students, which I previously thought incompatible with a major research university’s priorities. Princeton has truly exceeded my expectations. The attention and benefits it grants to its students, down to the very last boat-shoed one, is amazing. And if that is what it means to be a quintessential Princetonian, then quite frankly, I’m proud to be one.|~|Mitchell Hammer is a freshman from Phoenix, Ariz.

42439|~|Freedom to be|~|   October 2 2013|~|Column | Oct. 2 |~|Rebecca Kreutter|~|None|~|In last Tuesday’s paper, columnist Barbara Zhan took note of the changing expectations of work from elementary school to college and beyond. While mistakes in elementary school were overlooked and teachers often graded assignments based on perceived level of effort, in college, Barbara said, “Professors don’t look at long essays and think about how long it took to write, they just look at the content. If it’s terrible, so will be the grade it receives.” She connected this to how extracurriculars and interviewers search for the accomplished and even how Princeton housing fines students for forgetting their prox. While I agree that in college academics and some extracurriculars that “It’s not about how hard you try,” Barbara overlooks the significant freedom that we have here to make mistakes in other areas. There is a joke that my friends and I have that “there are no consequences at Princeton.” Aside from the obvious exception of breaking the Honor Code, Princeton — like most colleges — has very few rules. If you throw a party in your room, Public Safety is more likely to come by about noise complaints than anything else. Want to stay up late watching reruns of HIMYM, while work goes undone? That’s fine. Feel like staying out until 4 in the morning, or not coming home at all? Nobody will stop you. You can eat like a pig, or forage like a rabbit, or become an omnomnomivore without someone telling you about three square meals or the importance of eating vegetables. At college, you have the ability to drink yourself into oblivion, go to McCosh to sober up and still your parents will be none the wiser. Which is not to say you should drink yourself sick or spend all night watching TV. The argument here is not that you should go crazy with all the freedom; it’s that Princeton — for me and for many who I’ve talked to — isn’t all about stricter standards and heightened expectations. It has been more about exploring who I am and what I’m comfortable with outside of the 8 a.m.-3 p.m. high school schedule. Yet, the stricter standards for academics and the looser standards for social conduct are not so different. They are both about transitioning from high school to post-graduation, whether that be graduate school, employment, marriage or a combination of the three. In academics, as in internship searches or extracurricular selections, more is expected of each student. “It is not about how hard you try” because it won’t be about how hard you try once you graduate. It will be about the results of your efforts, whether you labored over a report for hours or whipped it up in 30 minutes. Similarly, in non-academic areas, you are responsible for your actions. You are moving from a time in which you lived under your parents’ roof to one in which you will have the freedom and responsibility to craft your own life. Having the freedom to do that in college, and to make mistakes along the way with fewer consequences, is part of deciding what type of rhythm you want to your life. While Barbara makes a good point that Princeton work expects more from students by making standards harsher, she ignores the fact that social life also expects more from students, except this time with fewer rules. She makes it seem as if the standard that “it is not about how hard you try” is a negative aspect of leaving secondary education instead of a function of accepting greater accountability for your actions. I prefer the college life to high school where, as Barbara says, “sometimes completing the homework was enough” because my work carries both more weight and more worth. Sure, the bad grades and harsh comments are not easy to see, but I have been pushed at Princeton to improve my thinking, writing and speaking in ways that I had never been before. And I prefer the college life where I am responsible for getting myself home safe every night, for how healthy I eat, for how I budget my money and for all of the other inconsequential decisions that add up over time. I’ve made plenty of mistakes in my time here and will make plenty more in the next two years and beyond. That’s why I’m here. In short, “it is not about hard you try,” and it shouldn’t be.|~|

42223|~|The cult of exclusivity|~|   October 1 2013|~|Column | Oct. 1 |~|Katherine Zhao|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|When that orange tiger popped up on our screens back in March, it meant acceptance. It meant we beat out 93 percent of the applicant pool and made it to Princeton. It meant the end of awkward alumni interviews and hair-pulling stress sessions and agonizing over miniscule Common App edits. It was the end to the grueling college application season. Little did we know that in less than a year’s time, we’d be going through another application season, but this time for acceptance by our peers. All of the colorful posters on the bulletin boards advertise auditions, promising “no experience necessary!” Several hundred rejections later, we definitely smell something fishy. After being initially accepted by Princeton, we have to fight all over again to be accepted. It no longer matters that we got straight As in high school and that we aced our SATs and AP exams. That’s the first thing on everyone’s resume here. Being smart is now average. Everything is by application, by audition. Am I the only one who finds it bizarre that even the Princeton Chocolate Lovers’ Club is by application only? After winning the initial admission lottery and landing on the happy side of a 7 percent admission rate, once we’re here the odds are just not in our favor. I know someone who was rejected from intramural volleyball. There were four open spots and 12 hopefuls, 10 of whom were varsity players in high school. The star of a high-school track team getting rejected is no strange story here. “It sucks being told that you’re not good enough for what you’re good at here,” she said, after hearing back. I know people who were rejected from Triangle Club after years of Community Theater and others who’ve gotten rejected from Chapel Choir and Glee Club after years of high school choir. For a freshman, it’s hard to find a group of friends in an extracurricular when you have to compete to get into it. And when you’re listening to 20 cheering girls picking up your hall mate for the group you didn’t get into, it just feels 10 times worse. Maybe getting hit by a long string of rejections is part of the Princeton experience, unless you’re a track star with the voice of Aretha Franklin who can dance like Michael Jackson. In that case, you’re set for all four years, socially at least. The “ normal” people will just have to climb the ladder, rung by bloody rung. Ultimately, the question comes down to this: What good comes out of having such a cult of exclusivity permeating the campus? Perhaps it’s a taste of what’s to come in the real world, where capitalism means we fight to make it, and suck it up when we get hit by rejections. Is this good training, or is it something that contributes to the stress and depression that afflicts 50 percent of students? I’m leaning toward the latter, gloomier idea. Exclusivity creates a dichotomy of “good enough” and “not good enough.” When you’re told you’re “not good enough,” it stings. And when you’re not in control of the groups you want to join, it’s even worse. On the flip side, perhaps this exclusivity is our own fault for choosing the most selective groups to apply for. The most highly advertised groups are the most popular and thus the most selective. But perhaps exclusivity and the occasional (or more) rejection is just what Princetonians need to prevent us from sinking into a lazy, self-satisfied complacency. It’s not high school anymore. We’re a step closer to the real world, where hard work and dogged diligence are essential to survival. Exclusivity hurts, but it might also be good for us. It could force us to new levels of excellence while preserving our sense of humility. With that said, at the end of the day, if I’m going to petition for a new club this semester, it will be a club for people who didn’t get accepted into anything, and the club’s agenda will be to pick up everyone in the club. And of course, in classic Princeton style, the Society of People Who Didn’t Get Into Anything Else will be by application only.|~|Katherine Zhao is a freshman from East Brunswick, N.J.

42220|~|Is stepping back a step back?|~|   October 1 2013|~|Column | Oct. 1 |~|Isabella Gomes|~|None|~|In a college setting as rigorous as Princeton’s, to what extent is it socially acceptable for students to talk about the concept of “struggle”? We often hear our friends grieve over tricky problem sets and ridiculous amounts of reading, and it’s certainly not uncommon to hear someone in the dining hall talk about how his or her recent experience with grade deflation was a slap in the face. However, we rarely hear a student seriously discuss his or her struggle with college as a whole beyond the context of a single class, grade or exam — whether the issue lies with emotional and psychological well-being or with academic difficulty.  For students who have been so encouraged to be different — unique in our talents, our achievements, our backgrounds and interests — there seems to be such a strict mentality that we all follow a certain pathway that the American education system demands of us. This pathway seems to condemn the student who makes the brave decision to take time off to reflect and recharge before college, and who can make the courageous admission that he needs a break. So what exactly is this mindset that restricts us from doing what is best for us and prevents us from understanding that each of us runs at a different pace? After talking to many of the international students on campus, I realized that there is an alternative to this rigid schedule of high school, undergraduate college, graduate or professional school, then job that the American education system seems to hold in such high regard. For students from other countries, it’s not uncommon to take a gap year abroad to gain experience or work to help pay tuition fees before embarking on undergraduate studies. What’s more is that this decision isn’t viewed negatively — it’s neither a reflection of the individual against his peers nor is it a statement about the student’s likelihood for success. I spoke with five Princeton students who withdrew from the University for a year about how their unique experiences ended up changing the discourse with which they discussed and approached the idea of success and struggle on campus. For many of them, the problem started with this idea of the concrete endpoint. When we enter college, we’re ambushed with seemingly harmless questions such as “what’s your major?” This is when we might start to realize we don’t have a goal that fits in as smoothly as the goal of “getting into a good college” did in high school. While we might have been that put-together kid when we were younger, college brings up the daunting possibility that we no longer have a detailed battle plan that will get us to whatever end we’re hoping for. One student I talked to said, “I felt like I had to wear a mask because everyone expected me to have the right answer, and when I didn’t, I began to question what and how I was doing.” What no one ever really tries to instill in us is that, thus far, we have been given neither a sufficient amount of time nor guidance to decide what we want to do on the grand scale of life and that college is merely the first rung in this journey — not the whole ladder. It’s okay to admit that maybe you’ve reached a time in your life when you have to take some time for yourself. We don’t all function according to some mechanism that the University or the American education system has dictated that we follow, and if we truly cannot handle the speed, there’s nothing wrong with us; it’s the environment in which we find ourselves struggling that needs to accommodate its exceptional students. Scot Tasker ’16, whose inspirationally honest reason for temporarily withdrawing was that he felt “wildly unhappy” at Princeton, realized that many students struggled with terms such as “depressed.” It was too much of a psychiatric label for people to understand and empathize with. For some of the other interviewees, they didn’t feel comfortable talking about their problems to even their closest friends, going so far as to create a cover story that would be acceptable to others. Why should they have to make their reasoning accessible to anyone? Being at Princeton seems to require a perpetual proof of our merit, and, should we not be able to provide such a demonstration, we fear that others will associate things such as a failed grade with overall failure. This discourse needs to change. If it doesn’t, we eliminate any chance we have to actively seek out help or to experience an empathetic connection with our peers that lets us know we’re not alone. In Scot’s case, his experience taught him that “we often lose sight of the fact that we actually have the ability to understand what others are going through more than we give ourselves credit for.” This idea of success needs to change — not necessarily away from academic achievement, but toward a greater realization that college encompasses our emotional and social development as well as our scholarship.|~|Isabella Gomes is a sophomore from Irvine, Calif.

42239|~|Straight talk|~|   October 1 2013|~|Column | Oct. 1 |~|Ryan Dukeman|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|One of the things I was most uncertain about as an incoming freshman was the Street. I never drank in high school, and my friend group didn’t party much, so I didn’t really know what to expect when I arrived on campus. My assumption was that I would be lost amid a sea of people much more at ease than me, and that I would head to the Street each weekend to find myself out of place and out of my element. And really, that’s all I had to go off of: assumptions. Because the fact of the matter is that until you reach freshman year, no one talks about the Street in any official capacity. Tours — even ones where parents aren’t present — dodge all questions related to Princeton nightlife. The Street closes for the entire weekend of Preview, so even if you stay an extra night with a friend, you don’t get to see what actually goes on at Princeton on Saturday nights. It wasn’t until Outdoor Action — just a week before I started as a Princeton freshman and several months after I’d committed to Old Nassau — that I first heard straightforward information about the Street from upperclassmen. (It’s worth noting that even then, they checked with each other before speaking to make sure they were “allowed to talk about” the Street and what clubs they were in.) After months of waiting for more than a casual joke or passing funny story from upperclassman friends, I finally got some information about that part of the Princeton experience. What was revealed wasn’t shocking to anyone or damaging to anybody’s esteem of the school. All that our group talked about was that the Street was where people went on weekends to hang out, dance, meet people and/or drink; that each club had a tap room and an overcrowded dance floor; that the “Beast” was free and generally regarded as gross; and that no one really cared how much or little you wanted to drink. Just hearing this was reassuring. It made the clubs seem like real places that friendly, fun, sensible kids went to and enjoyed. At the very least, it provided an alternative view to the anonymous “Animal House” depiction that I (and many) had in mind. Reassuring as this was to hear before starting school, I wish I had been able to hear it earlier. Having been to most of the clubs, I now know that you quickly get at least a basic sense of the atmosphere at each one and can decide for yourself which clubs you and your friends prefer. And while bad things obviously happen to people on occasion, most people just enjoy themselves on the Street on the weekends. I’ve also felt no pressure or stigma related to drinking whatsoever and still enjoy heading to the Street with my friends. The point is, in general, the eating club system is not something to be hidden away from visitors or prospective applicants like some ugly behemoth or necessary evil. For most people, it is a fun social outlet that becomes a memorable (or hard-to-remember) part of college. And for those who are not inclined toward the Street, there is so much else happening on campus that it’s nearly impossible to be bored. So why is Street-related information so hard to get before you make it on campus as a freshman? It is in the best interest of both prospective applicants and the University to allow and encourage upperclassmen to be more forthcoming and open regarding the Street. For most people, myself included, this would eliminate a significant uncertainty about coming to Princeton. And regarding those for whom this information would be a dissuading factor, it is not in the University’s best interest to court people under false pretenses only to have a much higher risk of them transferring out once they inevitably discover what was being hidden from them. Obviously I’m not saying Dean Rapelye should give a speech about Prospect Avenue and which clubs have the best parties to every family in an information session. But at the very least, the University should encourage upperclassmen to speak as openly and candidly as possible to prospective students, not just on this matter, but on all facets of Princeton life. Maybe part of the visit should include a private discussion with just the tour guide and the students. Maybe applicants should be provided with an anonymous forum to ask questions of Princeton students. In any case, just give us some straight talk; everyone is better off making well-informed decisions, and I daresay the vast majority of people who were in my shoes would realize much, much earlier that there was nothing on Prospect Avenue to worry about.|~|Ryan Dukeman is a freshman from Westwood, Mass.

41992|~|The social bottleneck|~|   September 30 2013|~|Column | Sept. 30 |~|Christian Wawrzonek|~|   Columnist     |~|Entering my sophomore year, I began discussing with my friends the inevitable decision of which eating clubs to consider.  This question seems so different now than when I pondered it only a few months earlier. As a freshman, the idea of “bickering” an eating club seemed exciting. It has all the right qualities to be more appealing to freshmen than any other class. As the new kids on the block, you don’t know many other students, and you desperately crave to find a new place to fit in and feel accepted. There’s even an added feeling of accomplishment if you successfully make it into an exclusive club like Cottage or, God willing, Ivy. An article written in the ‘Prince’ last year made an uncomfortably accurate observation: Princeton students are obsessed with exclusivity. Most important of all, as a freshman, you have nothing to lose by throwing your hat in the ring and getting into the club of your dreams. Hell, it might even feel like reading that acceptance letter from Princeton all over again. I am only now coming to realize how naive a view that really is. By this time in my Princeton career, the social anxiety of making my way in the strange new world of college life has largely worn off. I’ve struck a good balance between study and leisure, I fill my time with a good mix of enjoyable activities and most importantly, I have a large and diverse network of friends drawn from many different corners of the Princeton campus. Life seems good, and the decision of joining an eating club is becoming more and more of a chore every day. I’ve found that one of the biggest benefits of Princeton’s relatively small size is that it’s easy to stay connected to a lot of people.  You essentially see the same students in many of your classes. I can’t imagine walking into a class at UCLA and already knowing 15 of the 20 people in the room. Everyone uses the same communal spaces: Frist Campus Center, Dillon Gymnasium, Firestone Library (jk, nobody goes to Firestone).  Even just walking between classes, I have to stop at least a dozen times to catch up with friends I see along the way. Above all else, as underclassmen, everyone eats in the same places. Walk into Wu/Wilcox dining hall at 6:30 during the peak of dinner rush, and the list of people you could sit and eat with, swap advice, vent on or just chat with is astronomical. To me, that’s the most appealing aspect of feeding time (it certainly isn’t the food — no offense to Dining Services). Meals are social events, downtime to unwind with friends before or after a long day of work. Spent right, they can be the best time for maintaining relationships otherwise impossible to have. As a member of lightweight crew, I know that any time I want to talk to some of my closest friends, there will be a horde-like gathering in Whitman dining hall taking up at least three tables to the dismay of many Whitmanites. But I budget my meals well. I split my dinners with crew and my other friends, such as club croquet or even just my hallmates and ex-zees. Breakfast and lunch are spent almost exclusively in Forbes, because there ain’t no family like the Forbes Family. The most important thing is that I never have to question whether or not I can eat with anyone. All the dining halls are open to me all of the time. This just isn’t the case with the eating clubs. Now, some people might respond with, “But you can always get a guest pass” or, “Just use the meal exchange,” etc., etc. Yes I could, but rarely do I ever plan my dinners days in advance. Everything is casual and impromptu. Have I eaten with them recently? OK, I think I’ll try Mathey today (yeah, I even go to Mathey). Guest cards, shared meals, they’re all just unnecessary hassles that will prevent me from doing what I can do now for nothing. The beauty of the dining halls is their simplicity. So, why then am I being forced to segregate myself from my friends? Why do I have to pick one group of people I like most and literally join a club with them? And why do I have to enter into some stereotyped variety of people — floaters and boaters, stoners, preppy kids — in order to enjoy lunch with a friend? What are the eating clubs? They are a social bottleneck, a restriction on the number and type of relationships I can sustain. They are a forced segregation of students into categorized groups. They are machines for perpetuating and exacerbating social cliques. They are an unnecessary limitation on the set of people I can see and eat with every day. Yet, the most disappointing thing about them is they are almost unavoidable. Because of their prevalence, if I want to eat with any of my friends at all, I have to join one or else risk losing my friends all together. Thus, I begin pondering which club to join, only this time I’m not thinking which place will be ultra-exclusive or throw lots of parties. Now, I just want to find a club that will limit me the least. So, if writing this lowers my chances of getting into Ivy, I’ll accept that. I might just embrace my given stereotype and join Cloister like all of the other genital-flashing rowers.|~|Christian Wawrzonek is a sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pa.

42013|~|Assimilation through total immersion?|~|   September 30 2013|~|Column | Sept. 30 |~|Jiyoon Kim|~|   Contributing Columnist     |~|In the middle of my first week of classes here at Princeton, I could finally take a breath. After the bombardment of information, presentations, activities and icebreakers that my two-week orientation experience entailed, starting classes felt ironically like a respite. I left Tokyo and arrived at Princeton on Aug. 28, crossing the dateline and repeating a day as international students often do. Moving in was a blur of rain, golf carts, connecting to DormNet and wishing I could rely on more than the “puvisitor” wireless network on my Japanese phone to communicate with my parents back home. After the International Orientation opening dinner and a long, 48-hour Aug. 28, I finally stumbled back to Bloomberg Hall only to find that a lonely silence permeated throughout campus, whose only inhabitants were varsity athletes and other international students. Already, I pondered the effectiveness of inviting international students to an essentially vacant campus early under the pretext of helping them to better assimilate to life in Princeton and the States. I wondered whether the two other international students in my otherwise empty hall were feeling equally alone and out of place. What ensued was an accelerated course of what freshman week would entail for the rest of the freshman class. Presentations from the Department of Public Safety, McGraw Center, Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources & Education and the likes were more or less preview versions of the arguably more entertaining and substantial presentations that would occur during freshman orientation a mere week later. Granted, obtaining relevant information about life at Princeton in a smaller setting was valuable and appreciated by many; however, efforts to offer as much information as possible, as soon as possible, left international students without ample time to grapple with the sheer notion of being so far away from home. Freshmen already exhausted from IO were then uprooted from campus, after having spent three nights in our dorms, for the Outdoor Action and Community Action trips. (As students weren’t allowed to stay on campus during this week, these trips were essentially mandatory for international students). Having begun to settle into my dorm, I was now longing for both my home in Tokyo and my new home on campus. Undoubtedly, I was enjoying the people I was with and the work I was doing. However, I wasn’t able to separate Community Action in my mind from IO. It was all a blur of non-routine unfamiliarity. For many students who had undergone IO and one of the pre-orientation trips, freshman week became yet another orientation to get through, as opposed to the official exciting beginning to my career at Princeton. It became almost a ritual for international students to, upon encountering another IO buddy, commiserate over the prospect of attending informational session number 14. Once the orientation frenzy was over, many students were overwhelmed by the onslaught of emotions — loneliness, homesickness, fear, anxiety, excitement — that they hadn’t had a chance to cope with until classes were about to begin. As fantastic as my IO group leaders were, and as much as I enjoy running into people I met during orientation, it is difficult to say that the current structure of pre-orientation and orientation at Princeton meets the needs of students assimilating into a new environment, culture and country. I understand the reasoning behind packing every moment during a pre-orientation period with activities and plans; in a situation of total immersion, students will have no choice but to assimilate and no time to dwell on homesickness or the overwhelming novelty of everything around them. However, students were so busy doing one thing or another to actually appreciate the other opportunities and experiences IO offered. I would urge future IO coordinators to take advantage of the smaller group setting that IO offers. IO groups served more of an organizational function than a community-building purpose; more time could be spent fostering relationships among IO leaders — who are, at least so far, the most welcoming and helpful upperclassmen I have met here at Princeton — and their groups, and less on learning technical information about Princeton that can be obtained later during freshman orientation. A greater focus on assimilating to culture and life in the States may be of more value than time spent on presenting information about Princeton; students enjoyed learning about life on campus a great deal more once all the freshmen were on campus for freshman week. The potential for IO is great. I myself was enticed by the notion of entering Princeton with a smaller, close-knit group of people making the same transition I was. Though the group of students at IO was indeed small — comprised of a little more than 100 students — it never was as close-knit as I had imagined it could become. A shift in the goals of IO could give students a chance to start calling Princeton their home.|~|Jiyoon Kim is a freshman from Tokyo, Japan. She can be reached at ljkim@princeton.edu. 
42024|~|The slow waltz|~|   September 30 2013|~|Column | Sept. 30 |~|Aaron Robertson|~|   Intersections Critic     |~|In the multipurpose room of Dillon Gymnasium, I found my hips turning slowly to Enya’s “Wild Child.” It was something I wouldn’t have wanted my grandfather to see. Honestly, any sensible person would have looked elsewhere. For this was war. I had unfinished business with the dance floor, and I was there to resolve it. The year before, I had a leading role in Athol Fugard’s three-man show, “Master Harold and the Boys.” Set in South Africa during apartheid, the play examines the lives of the young, eponymous protagonist and the two servants in his mother’s teahouse. Throughout the drama, Sam (my character) and Willie, the other servant, prepare for a major ballroom competition in Port Elizabeth. According to the script, Sam displays the finesse of a dancer who has had years to practice and fine-tune every step. The two friends dream of emulating Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and, in one of the more moving monologues from the show, Sam explains how the dance floor is a place where, unlike the oppressive world outside, people don’t need to collide. Although I kept the spirit of the script close to my heart, I had already been disadvantaged coming into the role. Sam, a 50-something-year old man, had achieved a level of mastery that I couldn’t expect to accomplish in two months. He spoke longingly of the waltz, the foxtrot, the complicated quickstep. In my head, I could picture the well-composed flourishes of an experienced competitor. Sam, I knew, could dance blindly around the teahouse without disturbing a single chair. I deluded myself by thinking that, in such a short time span, I could maneuver with as much grace as Fugard demands. I remember studying YouTube dance instruction videos and becoming frustrated when the teacher wouldn’t slow down. It was as though he knew the extent of my blaspheming. Chasse, step, ball, heel, ball, heel. He would repeat this like a curse. Despite its difficulty, I insisted on watching the tutorials for advanced, gold-level dancers. Even though I called it dedication to the role, I didn’t realize that I was actually disrespecting not only the character but also the dance itself. By assuming I would be able to perform each step with relatively minimal practice, I ignored the beautiful struggles that could only result from years of work. On the eve of the first performance, I spoke to the director of the show. “Doc, I don’t think Austin [Willie] and I have the moves down.” My director nodded and reassured me that I would only have to “spin Willie” instead of launching into a tricky step. In two months, rather than elevating the role to something great, I had only made it convenient. Still, the show itself was fine. The audience enjoyed the performances, and the cast received kind words. But I knew that, personally, I had lost. And so, when I learned of Princeton’s ballroom team, I had no doubt that I would commit myself to the cause. And though it began as a redemption exercise, I can see that I’m going to stay with it because, well, it’s so damn fun. Yes, the elegance is there. But what’s more is the wonderful embarrassment of stumbling into the couple beside you and having no time to apologize before your feet have dragged you into the next movement, a New Yorker or a forward-walking turn toward the mirror where you can only see yourself in passing. The limp hand. The smile you have made. Ballroom is watching the steadying of feet. Eventually, yours will join the shuffle. You’ll find that it is all right to hold your partner’s hands as though they are your own. That, unless you think about it too much, you probably won’t step on her foot. That hips must sway before they swing. The laughter comes, and so does the sweat. People close their eyes to the most unlikely songs, singing “Billie Jean” and hopping the jive. Ballroom has you practice your steps at the top of Blair Tower, in small niches dressed in Christmas lights, flashing clover that casts you into the glass. And, looking out into the dark, you hope that some drunken student is watching you, laughing because they thought you were some ghost disappearing, spinning away from them. It is learning a new way to move and counting 1-2-3-cha-cha-cha-2-3. Ballroom is the movement of the rhythm-hungry, the shape of two bodies placed against whatever backdrop you have the wherewithal to imagine. Shimmering dresses and pleated slacks, bowties and blackcherry liner rung around lips and eyes like cyclones. At least, that’s the dream. Until then, I’ll continue to groove to Enya. And perhaps, someday, I’ll understand exactly what Fugard and Sam are saying. The dance floor is a place of redemption and new experiences. A place where people glide and stumble. And, so it seems, it is a place for me. Here’s to four years of learning how to take it slow.|~|Aaron Robertson is a freshman from Detroit, Mich. He can be reached at aaroncr@princeton.edu. 
41665|~|Editorial: LA requirement change|~|   September 29 2013|~|Editorial | Sept. 29 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|Princeton has long been a leader in liberal arts education, and in today’s increasingly pre-professional world, the University stands strongly behind its goal of providing all students with a broad base of knowledge. While students often bemoan distribution requirements, these courses are crucial in guaranteeing that each one of us is exposed to a wide range of disciplines and ways of thinking. Sure, the system is not perfect, but requirements ensure that, by the time we walk through the FitzRandolph Gate, we will have had at least some practice reading literature, conducting science experiments and speaking a foreign language. This is certainly a worthy goal, and the requirements do a decent job of meeting it. But the system is not perfect, and there are some ways it could be improved.  A good place to start is with the Literature and the Arts requirement. The Board believes that, as it stands, the LA requirement is too broad. Instead, the LA requirement should be split into two separate requirements so that each student would take at least one course in literature and at least one in the arts, instead of two courses within this large category. Under the current requirements, it is possible for a student to graduate from Princeton without ever having studied a piece of fiction or explored a work of art. The objective of distribution requirements is to ensure a well-rounded education, but the structure of the LA requirement undermines this because it allows students to take just arts courses or just literature courses. We believe that while literature and the arts are related, they are sufficiently different and offer students different critical skills, making them independently important. The skills that a student uses to analyze a text are certainly not the same ones that a student uses to critique a painting or a symphony; both skills are important components of a liberal arts education. By splitting the current LA requirement into a literature requirement and an arts requirement, the University could further ensure that all students receive a comprehensive education without placing an extra burden on their schedules. In the past, two LA courses were required, so the number of distribution courses necessary for graduation would not change. In addition, both literature and arts courses can be found across a variety of departments, so selecting appealing courses that fulfill these requirements would not be difficult. The arts requirement, for example, could certainly be fulfilled in the art and archaeology department, but many courses in music, visual arts, dance and theater would also be satisfactory. And while literature may seem to indicate a course in the English department, there are dozens of courses in journalism, comparative literature, creative writing, American studies and East Asian studies that include significant literature components. Unlike the core curriculum present at some schools, Princeton’s distribution requirements allow students a great deal of flexibility in choosing courses across disciplines. While the Board acknowledges that some students may use this flexibility to avoid seriously engaging with disciplines that do not interest them, we believe that most students engage seriously with a diverse array of fields. Splitting the LA requirement will not completely deter students who wish to avoid serious engagement with literature and art, but it will help encourage a broader exploration of the humanities for most students. This is a small change that will make a positive difference without placing a burden on students. Literature and the arts are important disciplines that offer valuable skills, and all Princeton students should have experience in both areas.   DISSENT: ZACH HORTON Princeton’s distribution requirement system attempts to preserve what it fundamentally undermines. Distribution requirements were meant to expose students to a complete set of important disciplines. However, by granting students the license to choose from a whole host of courses — many only nominally connected to the discipline category — students can easily avoid getting the well-rounded education that the system was intended to provide. The Board rightly seeks to remedy the problem for the LA requirement, but, in reality, its solution can only do so much. After all, there already exist a plethora of courses for students who want to avoid engaging with tough literature or serious art. I propose instead a hybridization between distribution requirements and a core curriculum. Each distribution requirement would come attached with either a single core course or choice of core courses. For distributions with two course requirements, the other requirement would be chosen just as they are chosen now. For example, to fulfill the LA requirement under this system, students might be required first to choose from one of six broad core literature/arts courses: American, European, or World (Literature or Art, respectively). Then, for the second LA requirement, students would freely choose however they wish (Children’s Literature, for instance). This hybrid system would better match the rigidity and academic rigor of a core curriculum with the flexibility and liberty of interests that broad distribution requirements encourage.  |~|
41829|~|A whimsical tale of the Dinky canopy|~|   September 29 2013|~|Column | Sept. 29 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Ellen Chances Once upon a time, there was a canopy that stood tall and happy at the Princeton train station. She eagerly awaited the Dinky, as the little train returned from his adventures in the land of Princeton Junction. The canopy loved to watch the engineer and conductor step through the Dinky door. She loved to watch the passengers, as they went to and from the Dinky. She especially loved to watch the people who met or bid farewell to loved ones. (She secretly dubbed them “kissers” as she blushed and chuckled to herself.) The canopy loved the springtime, when staccato melodies of newborn sparrows filled the air. One day, the canopy became sad. There were no more kissers, no more passengers, no more conductors, no more engineers. And there was no more Dinky that used to stop right next to her, every half hour. The canopy was lonely. People rushed by. No one walked on the platform that she carefully sheltered, night and day. She heard the Dinky in the distance, but she couldn’t see him. Metal fences surrounded her. No one waited with her for the Dinky to arrive and leave. The canopy became lonelier and lonelier. No one needed her anymore. On rainy days and snowy days and hot sunny days, she had once felt proud that she could protect the Dinky passengers-to-be. She had once felt good that every spring, her wooden beams were homes for sparrow nests. The canopy decided that everyone had forgotten her. She felt rejected and abandoned. She was broken-hearted. She felt so despondent that she crumpled to the ground, her purpose in life dissipating in dust and smoke. The moral of my humble tale: Did the Arts and Transit Neighborhood committees and commissions and consultants, planners and designers and architects, ask the canopy what she thought about moving the Dinky station? No, they did not. Dear reader, you will certainly agree that they should have.

41823|~|In defense of a supposedly impractical major|~|   September 29 2013|~|Columns Opinion |~|Prianka Misra|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|For the entire day, he was all I could think of. Nervous thoughts rushed through my mind just as I rushed through my day. They pried me away from efficiency and toward a state of panic, distracting me from every task. How should I act? What should I wear? What would he say to me? What should I ask him? (I’m always terrible at asking questions.) Excitement and anxiety fueled this endless torrent. No, it wasn’t a date. Or maybe you could say it was a group date. It was a semi-intimate dinner with the CEO of Buzzfeed, Jon Steinberg ’99, that had quietly unleashed a flurry of butterflies in my stomach. Out of a number of events arranged by Whig-Clio, I felt that this one was particularly relevant, as Buzzfeed was responsible for a number of hours spent not doing homework and not sleeping. Here I was again, similarly distracted. But as we sat down to eat, a number of things he said made me uncomfortable. Don’t get me wrong — I was certainly inspired by some of his statements. When he told us that we could “outwork anybody,” and that our efforts could trump true genius no matter how smart our peers were, I felt a sense of hope (okay, cockeyed optimism, but I still chose to savor it). Or when Steinberg stated, “If you want to do something, now is the best time” with regard to entrepreneurial attempts and other save-the-world ventures, I felt that same warm fuzzy idealism in my heart. What a guy, I thought. But other things he said contradicted those feelings. Steinberg, as you may know, majored in the Wilson School. I plan to do so as well. When asked by one of my peers how he benefitted from the department, he grappled for a reason, and ultimately said that he hadn’t. I exchanged nervous glances with the five other Woody Woo majors in the room, and we all chuckled while our souls (yes, we have souls) burst into flames. It seemed that Steinberg’s primary source of disappointment in the Wilson School rested in his unsuccessful attempts to get thesis funding. But as he continued to explain his resentment, it seemed he also felt that the skills he obtained from the concentration were not relevant to the real world, ironically enough. Steinberg said he wished he had majored in economics or had gotten more coding experience in college. All of these were thoughts I had entertained before, but now were coming back to haunt me in a very tangible and urgent form. At the end of Steinberg’s lecture (which followed the dinner), he asked anyone who knew how to code or who was “good at math” to come see him. “We need you,” he stated. My heart sank. I felt like I had been told that nothing I was doing was important, that I would be stuck with a useless — or nonexistent? —  skill set after college that would be irrelevant and archaic in an advancing world, ripe with the fruits of technology. As I walked home, Steinberg’s perspective confused me even more. It angered me that he was essentially turning his back on his own department and academic context. He had made it this far, hadn’t he? And couldn’t at least part of that be attributed to what he learned in the Wilson School? What about perspectives on pressing international issues and news, which the company has been incorporating into its output? Learning about cross-cultural dynamics and socioeconomic trends to make his site appeal to a broad viewer base? Steinberg might have chosen to prioritize the world’s computer science and econ majors as the artists of the blank technological canvas that is the modern world, but I am majoring in the Wilson School because I want to learn about the issues and debates that fill that world. I don’t believe that my major is as much of a limiting factor in the real world as Steinberg made it out to be. In fact, I really don’t think that my major is going to affect what I do in life — the skills I pick up along the way are more important. Do I know about domestic and international issues? Do I know how to support my arguments in a professional setting? Do I know how to perform basic data analysis? Just because he felt he didn’t benefit from Woody Woo doesn’t mean no one can. Although Buzzfeed is certainly a prestigious company, getting a job at Buzzfeed is not the same as getting a job in general. The skills that Steinberg felt he needed to build a successful career are not universal keys to surviving in the real world. I think I’ll stick to Woody Woo, take some of Steinberg’s more optimistic advice and go get the skills I need if I feel like I’m really behind the times. Maybe I’ll be able to outwork the others, or maybe I’ll be able to come up with something else entirely.|~|Prianka Misra is a sophomore from Castro Valley, Calif.  She can be reached at pmisra@princeton.edu. 
41414|~|Outside the Bubble: Ted Cruz 2016|~|   September 26 2013|~|Column | Sept. 26 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|Finishing at 21 hours and 19 minutes, Sen. Ted Cruz ’92 may have broken the record for longest campaign announcement speech in history. This past Tuesday, as the University celebrated the 100th birthday of famous past Princeton student F. Scott Fitzgerald, another alumnus, Senator Ted Cruz, made tidal waves in the press. While Cruz did not actually announce a presidential run or even allude to his future political ambitions, it is clear that what went on was merely narcissistic play, lacking any connection to his stated goal of ending Obamacare. On Sept. 30, the current fiscal year ends, and a government shutdown will follow unless a new spending resolution is passed before then. Earlier this week, the House had passed a bill that would continue to fund the federal government. Included in the bill was a provision that would defund Obamacare, weeks before enrollment for benefits begin. In response, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called for a vote to strip that provision and re-send the bill back to the house. However, before the Senate could vote to start debate on the resolution, Cruz took to the senate floor. Attempting to stall the bill, he proclaimed that he was ready to “speak in opposition of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand.” Now I’ll admit, there are valid arguments for and against Obama’s healthcare reform bill, passed in 2009. Cruz’s disapproval of Obamacare is not a reason for chastising. That being said, wasting 21 hours and 19 minutes of floor time is. This is no “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” The filibuster serves to protect minority rights in the face of supermajorities. However, unlike the lone statesman pitted against the establishment, Cruz is not trying to “Love thy neighbor,” but rather is pushing against a bill that would continue to fund the federal government, preventing a government shutdown. What’s even more painful is that Cruz knew ahead of time that procedural rules would force his speech to end Wednesday afternoon. Unlike a real filibuster, it had zero chance of succeeding from the beginning. Rather than attempting to accomplish a significant policy achievement, he was merely rallying his base. And it is this very concept, that I feel, defies what it means to be a Princetonian. Not only do his actions fly in the face of most of the other members of the Senate, such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who called Cruz’s 21-hour speech a “big waste of time,” but Cruz’s actions also go against the views of many other Republicans including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Whip John Cornyn, who thought he had taken the wrong approach. His desire to push forward, even when it is almost unanimously agreed upon that his actions are merely a waste of time, is unsettling. The motto “Princeton in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations” alludes to a social responsibility to benefit not just ourselves, but those around us. While there may be different ways to achieve this end, the motto should especially hit close to home to those in public service. Granted no two students think exactly alike, and many, if they are ever in public service, will believe that there are different ways to better society. Yet with achieving zero personal major legislative accomplishments, causing more partisanship in the Senate, and trying to shut down the government, I fail to see how Sen. Cruz has so far best served our nation. Instead, in his speech, he compared his fellow Republicans to the complacent Neville Chamberlain of the 1940s, who allowed Nazi Germany to expand in influence, and made comparisons to Star Wars with “the Empire being the D.C. establishment.” While the Star Wars reference may be somewhat amusing, I fear that this kind of rhetoric and political approach is only further fueling the acidic and unflattering environment that has plagued Washington, D.C. in the past several years. As Princeton students, who may one day be in similar situations of power, I think we need to not only be aware of what is happening, but also recognize the toxicity of such a firebrand approach — and if ever put in that situation, serve beyond our own interests. Beyond the political buzz and media headlines, two days later, the sun is still rising and the spending bill is still being looked at in the same light that it had been looked at before. It appears that the only thing that has truly changed is Ted Cruz’s reputation. When Woodrow Wilson gave his speech, titled “Princeton in the Nation’s Service,” which would eventually become our unofficial school motto, he highlighted the “spirit of service” as what would “give a college place in the public annals of the nation.” In light of this, Wilson must be rolling in his grave, knowing that Senator Cruz — blessed with the power to make a meaningful difference — has just wasted 21 hours and 9 minutes working for the betterment of himself, rather than the nation.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn.  He can be reached at bjd5@princeton.edu.

41415|~|What being #1 really means|~|   September 26 2013|~|Column | Sept. 26 |~|Ye Eun Charlotte Chun|~|None|~|I had just gotten back from the Street, clothes crusted in heaven-knows-what, when my mother calls me from Korea at 4 a.m. It took me a moment to figure out exactly what she was saying; it was a mixture of hyperventilation and uncharacteristic squealing, and my interpretation was not particularly enhanced by my own state of consciousness. The fact that my mother never gets excited and looks like she’s calling the Secret Service even when she’s ordering pizza made this a particularly bizarre experience. Had I not known any better, I would’ve guessed she’d won the lottery; in reality, she’d just seen this year’s U.S. News and World Report list of top U.S. colleges. Let me pause here and disclaim that my mother is neither overly obsessive nor a “big mother” figure who knows more about what goes on in Princeton than I do. She also rarely fixates on admissions statistics or grades, so you can understand my surprise at her enthusiasm. However, after hanging up the phone, I began to realize just how significant Princeton’s “new” ranking was from the perspective of international students, and just how big of a push this could be for Princeton’s global prestige. To begin, it’s important to recognize the differences in cultural perceptions of tertiary education, especially for international students who have parents who have never attended college in the United States. Many countries forego the “holistic” qualitative admissions process found in the United States in favor of strictly quantitative admissions, which many deem more egalitarian. The Chinese, for example, claim that having admissions based off of standardized testing alone allows for students of all backgrounds and talents to attend the university of their choice. While most Americans would balk at such a sentiment, it’s one I understand and could argue for, despite my personal convictions against it. The degree to which rankings are even desired shows a huge cultural gap between the international mindset and the more domestic one. Many East Asian public schools have been known to publish ranks of students based on their grade point averages and test scores as a means of encouraging hard work and competition. Quantitative criteria are favored over qualitative, and any widely acknowledged resource like U.S. News and World Report will be clung to without a second thought. There is also the issue of rankings being the only gauge of what many of these universities are like for certain applicants. While I was fortunate enough to have a mother who attended an American university, there are many other international students whose parents have little knowledge of what American college is “suitable” for their child. Personal accounts of friends and alumni are limited, especially in areas where only a few leave to study abroad and fewer return to share their experiences, making virtual college profiles the main source of information. So what does it mean to the world that Princeton’s monopolizing #1 (and not Harvard)? Princeton’s international prestige is starting to skyrocket in circles that formerly overlooked it. It seems all too familiar that I would return to Seoul and have people know about all the UCs but have never heard of Princeton. A big reason for this is our lack of professional graduate schools, making it difficult for those with undergraduate degrees from other countries to study at Princeton. Furthermore, despite the relatively high percentage of international students here on campus, the absolute sum is quite small, and the number returning to their home countries to spread word of Princeton even more negligible. However, with the release of U.S. News’s college rankings, this has already begun to change. The “shock” of Harvard being pushed down the list has triggered a series of reports not only spreading the news, but also raising awareness about the institution as a whole. Korea’s three main television broadcast stations KBS, SBS, and MBC held extended programs focusing specifically on Princeton’s research institutions, and even hinted at the rise of a liberal arts education, a radical change in tune from Korea’s usual emphasis on STEM fields. Just today, I ran into a large group of Korean students who had come from Jeolla Province, a district not known for sending students abroad, and especially not to Ivy League institutions. When I asked them how they had gotten to know about Princeton, they grinned and pulled out their Galaxy phones to show me a translation of the U.S. News college rankings. I could go on forever about various responses I got from my friends abroad after this year’s rankings were released, including a highly questionable email from a Jordanian friend I hadn’t heard from in over two years. Point being, while college rankings are always more a source of amusement for us than anything else, they have larger international implications for those who have limited opportunity to gauge for themselves what Princeton is like. So in a sense, being #1 isn’t just a Hurrah Hurrah in the Crimson’s face, but an opening of doors for the rest of the world to get to know us a little bit better.|~|Ye Eun Charlotte Chun is a sophomore from Seoul, South Korea.

41447|~|Editorial: The dining-option schism|~|   September 26 2013|~|Editorial | Sept. 26 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|The successful (or unsuccessful) conclusion of fall bicker reminds us that the central element of Princeton’s social experience is defined by our communal eating options. Whether on the Street or elsewhere, meal times offer us a break from our work, a chance to see friends and time to meet new people. For the first two years on campus, the required meal plan allows students to foster friendships within their residential college. However, come junior year, the dining model changes — students join eating clubs, co-ops or become independent. Students who can afford the added cost of eating clubs are able to continue this traditional communal mealtime experience. However, this benefit is not extended to every student: the roughly 30 percent of students who do not or can not join eating clubs are missing out on an integral part of the Princeton experience; they often do not have the same opportunity to expand their social horizons. In order to bridge this dining-option schism, the University should strive to make the residential college dining options more accessible to upperclassmen. As an effort to lessen the socially stratifying effects of the eating clubs, the University should encourage upperclassmen to utilize the residential college dining halls. This can be achieved by making the meal plan options more flexible and by better developing a sense of identity within the colleges. To be clear, we are not advocating the people abandon their eating clubs or condemning the club system; we are merely suggesting that the clubs be complemented by more extensive dining options. As it stands, upperclassmen without a meal plan are given two swipes a week at residential dining halls. This very limited access makes the residential dining halls seem uninviting to upperclassmen — it is clearly not designed to encourage exploration or intermixing of individuals from different classes and tends to be used now by groups of friends for reasons of simple expedience. If upperclassmen were offered the chance to purchase — or exchange for — more swipes a week, this would make the dining halls more upperclassman-friendly. This would also make it easier for independent/non-eating club members to interact with their classmates more regularly and without extensive deliberate planning. At present, Dining Services makes this scenario impossible with an inflexible meal plan set of options; the cheapest dining option is the 95-block-plan, which costs $3,225. Shared meal plans — which offer upperclassmen more dining hall meals in exchange for eating club meals — are in very limited supply and are usually only available for seniors. There should be, for example, a meal plan that gives upperclassmen 5 meals a week, for a reasonable extra fee. Recently, the University announced a plan that allows upperclassmen the ability to convert their 2 extra meal swipes into a flexible block of 30 meals for $200 a semester. While this represents a step in the right direction, it is inadequate to seriously encourage upperclassmen to make more frequent use of dining halls. In addition to making the dining options more flexible, the university should seek to use meal times as an opportunity to expand the sense of identity within residential colleges. For example, following a model used frequently by Whitman College, all residential colleges should institute semi-frequent “college nights” in which dining halls are restricted to current or former members of the college. In order to attract upperclassmen, the colleges should further consider making these meals of a higher quality than typical nights. The sense of shared identity derived from this type of initiative, perhaps integrated with a “theme” of celebration or shared activity, would encourage relationships across classes and social groups. Such a change in University policy would incur minimal cost, allow currently disenfranchised independents some context for a broader shared experience, and in general serve as a first step to unify a campus that continues to be perceived by some as fragmented and isolating. More communal, less restricted dining options within the residential colleges could only broaden Princeton’s social experience without dampening the small-community feel created in many eating clubs.|~|

41158|~|Princeton means washing dishes|~|   September 25 2013|~|Column | Sept. 25 |~|Bennett McIntosh|~|   Columnist     |~|This month, while everyone was returning to the quintessentially Princeton setting of ivy-covered castles (or, in the case of Wilson, ivy-covered bomb shelters), I was also returning, along with a number of others, to a setting that holds little in common with everything ivy: the Wilcox/Wu dish room. Three-and-a-half hours a night, two nights a week, I join my fellow student workers in a deceptively simple task — cleaning the dishes that hundreds of our classmates have used, so that they can be returned to the servery to be used by hundreds more. It’s a dirty, often monotonous job, though lightened by the attitudes of colleagues who can find humor in a mutilated fork or the surprising ricochets of a poorly thrown plate. More important for Princeton students, it’s a four-hour break from the pressures of the academic world. But I derive the most joy from the work itself. I can lose myself in it, caring for nothing but defending the dish room against the endless line of dirty dishes coming down the conveyor, or, more meaningfully, against our perennial foe, gastroenteritis. And here we reach the heart of my job satisfaction: Dishwashing is only truly meaningful when I put it in the context of the dining hall outside the dish room. Each night, several hundred of my classmates can enjoy a meal. The meal means food that nourishes their brains for classes and their bodies for athletic feats; it means company that sharpens their minds, morals and wit; it means time off from schoolwork (albeit shorter than my four-hour paid study break); it means eating as part of an undergraduate community 5,113 times larger than each individual student. And I, in my own small way, help provide that. This is not capital ‘S’ service. It’s not what we mean by “Princeton in the nation’s service.” It’s what economists mean when they say “the service sector.” This is not the ideal of service; it’s the gritty reality. This is the world of P-O’d customers, of pranked McDonald’s drive-through workers, of hard-working men and women who come home every night smelling like French-fry grease or beer or artificial butter-flavored popcorn taste-enhancement product. It is also the world of ever-smiling baristas, of the Dairy Queen worker who confronts the customer who swiped a $20 bill from a blind man, then slipped the blind man $20 out-of-pocket, of the kind, old groundskeeper adored by every child at my elementary school. Such mundane service, without expectation of recognition, is often the kind that is most meaningful, to both server and recipient. And it is this kind of service that is not discussed or honored at Princeton. This is not serving in an exotic location through Community Action, Peace Corps or Doctors Without Borders — it’s picking up thousands of beer cans along Elm Street after the P-rade has turned it into a sticky river of Bud, Miller and Heineken. I did just that during Reunions this year, after having gone through the P-rade twice while the same alumni whose detritus I would bag mere minutes later cheered me and my plaid band uniform forward. I felt connected to other Princetonians during the procession, but it was only afterward, as a cog in the machinery that keeps Reunions running sustainably and practically, that I felt myself a part of Princeton. Previously, I had only been celebrating with the community — now I was acting as its agent. Ambitious world-shakers and nation-builders that we are, we will without a doubt have much opportunity for significant work “in the nation’s service and the service of all nations” both now and after graduation. But during our four years here, we would do well to pay as much mind to serving our fellow Princetonians here and now. Mundane though they may be, tutoring, clerical work, Reunions tasks and yes, washing dishes, connect us to Princeton and to each other. It makes this place something more than a site for the exchange of money for skills and for knowledge — it makes Princeton a community.|~|Bennett McIntosh is a sophomore from Littleton, Colo.

41190|~|Religion isn't stupid|~|   September 25 2013|~|Column | Sept. 25 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By David Hammer We do not pretend to understand the occult forces that drive student group advertisement. Lately, however, things have taken a turn for the Cartesian. First was club swimming’s endearing “I swim, therefore IM” leaflet. Next was a provocative poster from the Princeton University Society of Humanists (PUSH): “I think, therefore I am Atheist.” As members of Princeton’s interfaith group, the Religious Life Council, we understand how challenging it is to capture our peers’ attention and to recruit new members. (Believe us, interfaith has never had the panache of, say, club swimming.) A worthy cause is all too easily lost in the fray, and so we sympathize with the need for posters that appeal to our classmates’ wit or to their burning passion for early modern philosophy. Regardless, words have weight, and we think PUSH’s words in particular are unfair both to our religious peers and to the banner of humanism. We assume PUSH doesn’t quite mean them — that they’re just being glib and that we’re just being grumpy. But that said, “I think, therefore I am Atheist” reflects a widespread attitude that merits attention. There are, of course, important criticisms of religion and of religious institutions, which should be discussed vigorously. A religious community, like any community, has the potential to advocate unreflective dogma, objectionable moral doctrines, superstition and belief in empirical falsehoods. These features should bother the religious and the non-religious alike. But another criticism of religion — manifest in these posters — is gaining purchase among some otherwise thoughtful people. It is, unfortunately, quickly becoming a default criticism: that religious people are unthinking and disengaged, that religion is essentially “stupid.” We think this argument is unsound. When we say someone is religious, we have not in that very breath said they are soft-minded. Many people of faith — including many people on this campus — are well aware of the intellectual arguments for and against religion. They struggle with them, and in turn, determine for themselves where they think the balance lies. We would do well to dispense with the simplistic idea that religion is always and everywhere an intellectual “crutch,” but we can only do this through sustained engagement with real, religious people. The alternative is to freeze constructive conversation before it begins in earnest. But that is a disaster. Religion, we think, is too important to ignore, whatever your beliefs. Religion can be profound and beautiful and morally edifying. Religious people can be thoughtful and interesting and worth engaging. We should examine religion together and ensure that our most cherished views — whatever they may be — are not dictated by prejudice or fear. We hope you go to PUSH’s meetings.  We hope you ask your friends to bring you to their religious services and that you try to unearth what religion means to them. We hope you attend a Shabbat dinner. We hope you check out Diwali at the Chapel, a celebration of the Hindu festival of lights. We hope you ask questions that matter and seek out a diversity of possible answers. We hope you think and, therefore, decide for yourself.

41187|~|Finding meaning in vocation |~|   September 25 2013|~|Column | Sept. 25 |~|Susannah Sharpless|~|None|~|During my internship program this summer, my fellow interns and I gathered in The Huffington Post offices, talking to former Princeton Dean of Religious Life (and current HuffPo Religion editor) Paul Raushenbush. He had answered all of our questions about the religious angle of HuffPo, the spiritual climate of New York City, and the challenges of working with religion in a country that calls itself secular. We had run out of things to share. There was a small pause, and then Raushenbush said to us, “Talk to me about what this summer has taught you about vocation.” We were silent. I personally hadn’t thought about vocation in so many words all summer. I had, though, raged against internships. Something in this rage was intimately connected with my desire to do something that felt “right,” like a vocation should, and internships just felt “wrong.” The idea of spending the summer doing work that’s by definition awful and then using that experience as motivation for ascending the corporate ladder was infuriating to me. It seemed — and still does — a backward system: Companies literally exploit their interns and then these interns come back for more. I have no idea why I’m supposed to want this white-collar type of success when the ways of getting there seem immoral and dishonest and downright unpleasant. Beyond my personal distaste for internships, it’s not like Princeton’s emphasis on them is that beneficial. When I have an unpaid internship, I’m not actually doing anything for my future. According to a 2012 study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, if I get a paid internship (which is highly unlikely for someone who wants to be a writer), I have a 60 percent chance of being hired. If I have an unpaid internship, I have a 37 percent chance. If I have no internship at all, though, I still have a 36 percent chance of getting hired by the same company. This is because — as the study explains — companies don’t want to hire unpaid interns because they’ll only have “clerical” experience. So the work a company asks you to do in your internship — menial, boring tasks you have to do because everybody else is a paid professional and their work has value — is therefore irrelevant. Honestly, it makes sense: If a company decides my labor is not worth paying for the first time around, they’re not going to pay me for it in the future. Maybe this is because, however, the kinds of internships I am pushed toward are not the “right” kinds of internships for me. This summer, I took an internship that was out of the way of what I (and my parents) thought I “should” be doing, and I absolutely loved it. I was a part of a new program from the Office of Religious Life and the Pace Center called the Interfaith Summer Internship Program, and I had been placed with a volunteer-run bookshop in Washington Heights. My co-workers were other volunteers who actually treated me like an equal. I had a flexible, open schedule, and I had an independent project that occupied most of my time and, above all, I — like everyone else — was happy to be there, committed to the cause. But Princeton was funding my summer. The real volunteers were not so lucky: This was an after-work volunteer commitment for most of them, and they needed other ways to pay the bills. They were all free-thinking, artistically minded people; they challenged conventional ideas of success, disagreed with many a bureaucratic, capitalist notion and — somehow — were self-sufficient. And that is not something Princeton shows me enough. Princeton applauds hard work and ambition, the successful ascension of the corporate ladder, the high-flying political career. No one ever, really, asks me to think about what Paul did when he asked about vocation: Will I be able to spend my life doing something that makes me happy? Do I even know what that is? I didn’t answer him, but the people I met this summer could have. They had all kinds of careers; they were writers and teachers, freelance artists and tutors, editors and welders. Some of them were only employed sporadically, and some still lived at home. But that didn’t matter to them or define them: What mattered was their art. That was their real job, an option that I hadn’t even realized I had before this summer. By prioritizing their craft, they somehow had figured out a way to make a living and a home in one of the most expensive and exciting cities in the world, to be engaged in their community and to seem pretty darn happy about it — and that is success enough for me.|~|Susannah Sharpless is a religion major from Indianapolis, Ind.  She can be reached at ssharple@princeton.edu.

40965|~|Privacy in the Internet age|~|   September 24 2013|~|Column | Sept. 24 |~|David Will|~|None|~|Edward Snowden’s leaks, and subsequent quest for asylum, transfixed people around the world. America’s response has been, at best, muddled. It’s hard to put up a united front when the scandal’s underlying issue of privacy divides the public. Lawmakers are also split, but support for the status quo endures. For once, what’s preventing action in Congress isn’t partisanship. There is plenty of anger and respect for Snowden on both sides of the aisle. What separates leaders and everyday citizens on the issue is less political than generational. Our generation’s overexposure online fuels the perception that young people today do not value privacy. Twitter and Facebook attract an entire generation’s unbecoming photos and fleeting thoughts. Millennials who chronicle their most embarrassing escapades on social media seem unaware that these postings are publicly preserved. Young people largely, it seems, can’t comprehend the future repercussions of what they share online. Yet they are, by and large, angry about the National Security Administration’s surveillance programs. The contradiction stems from a belief that behavior on social media is inconsequential, but that more private activities — everything from emailing to banking — are important. But this false distinction does not discount the fact that Millennials were raised in a unique environment, one that informs their outrage at the NSA. For older and middle-aged Americans — a demographic that includes the leaders who run the spying agencies — technology is something that came later in life. The Internet sprang up and revolutionized basic interaction and communication. Anyone who was around when the Internet arrived had to adapt. There was no other way to harness its ever-expanding force and influence. By contrast, Millennials came of age along with the Internet. To us, it’s organic. Young people today possess an innate appreciation for technology’s pervasiveness. Developing technological proficiency is akin to learning a language. There’s a unique fluency that develops in children from early and constant exposure. Millennials’ lifelong experience with technology is sufficient, but not necessary, for one to appreciate how electronic communication permeates every aspect of modern life. Technological skills don’t break cleanly along generational lines. There are plenty of tech-savvy baby boomers and tweens who have no command over the latest gadgets. Politicians of all viewpoints — from the libertarian Rand Paul to the far-left anti-war activist Dennis Kucinich — fully appreciate the privacy violations that the NSA perpetrates. The common element among critics of America’s spying regime is a recognition of technology’s expansiveness and, subsequently, privacy’s importance. American officials spin Snowden’s leaks to imply that every newly discovered surveillance program is legal and limited. The administration, for example, assured the public that the government doesn’t comb through the contents of private communications. In fact, that is untrue. Without warrants, the NSA sifts through huge swaths of the emails that come in and out of the United States. Analysts scour cross-border communications for information about individuals under government watch. Somehow, the expansiveness of the NSA’s phone call dragnet is supposed to be a comfort. The sheer amount of data stored, proponents of the NSA argue, makes it cumbersome for analysts to uncover deeply personal information. The government does not directly listen into phone calls under this program. But the stream of numbers, times and dates that are logged often expose a call’s substance and intent. Princeton professor Edward Felten, in a court brief filed on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, points out that organizations like Planned Parenthood receive contributions via text message. Many older Americans view technology as a distinct aspect of their lives. Electronic communication takes up a defined space. To many baby boomers and Gen-Xers, any inappropriate government encroachment on their digital privacy amounts to a targeted breach of their rights. By contrast, Millennials view online privacy more profoundly because they are more dependent on it. Electronic communication consumes every facet of a younger person’s existence.  The prospect of the government reading citizens’ emails and tracking their phone calls alarms young people especially because more of their lives are digitized and therefore vulnerable to intrusion. The privacy debate has raised profound questions in the wake of the NSA leaks. Just how many intimate details must a free people part with in the name of safety? When has privacy been compromised so greatly in the name of security that there is little left to protect? The country will continue grappling with these vexing questions, perhaps with no resolution. In the meantime, the voices of those who are most personally invested in digital privacy should not go unheeded.|~|David Will is a religion major from Chevy Chase, Md.

40951|~|It's not how hard you try|~|   September 24 2013|~|Column |~|Barbara Zhan|~|   Columnist     |~|Life was easy in elementary school. As long as we paid attention, didn’t fight other kids and dutifully recited our ABCs, we were good. We were smart, and we were praised for it. The same thing went on in middle school and, even to some extent, in high school. Even if you went to a challenging high school that was academically rigorous, the effort you put in was taken into account in one way or another. For most people, there was partial credit — even if the answer was wrong, as long as your steps looked somewhat logical, you got a few points back. The longer the essay, the better the score it was likely to receive. Sometimes just completing the homework was enough. Accuracy didn’t matter. At Princeton, things are different. Professors don’t look at long essays and think about how long it took to write, they just look at the content. If it’s terrible, so will be the grade it receives. It doesn’t matter if you studied for eight hours and your friend looked at the syllabus 20 minutes before the test. You have a better shot at getting a better grade, but depending on how smart your friend is you two may get the same exact grade. Dance groups across campus say they’ll take people with zero dance experience — sure, if you’re preternaturally flexible and can come up with your own improv choreography on the spot. Despite what they say at the club fair, a Princeton dance group or a cappella group or orchestra is not for the “interested” or “enthusiastic” — it’s for the good. Because no one cares how hard you try. It’s all about the results. Take that principle up a notch, and you have the summer internship fair. There, of all places, it becomes abundantly clear that all that matters is how good you are. How good you are could be measured in the number of programming languages you know and your proficiency in them, in how fluently you can speak multiple languages, in how good your interpersonal and communication skills are. But no matter the metric, companies care most about what skills you have, not whether you tried really hard in math but couldn’t get the hang of it, whether you wrote some poems for a lit mag but they didn’t get accepted. As a sophomore who is not skilled at the moment, I was definitely turned away by the majority of companies there who were looking for experienced upperclassmen, and I accept that. I’m simply not good enough right now for the internship positions they’re looking to fill, but I’ll strive to change that for next year. It feels like there’s almost no room for error. That’s because there isn’t. That’s how it is at Princeton and even more so in the real world. If you make mistakes, you will pay for them, either with a hit to your grade or with your job. That’s not to say every little mistake will cost you everything you have, but every little mistake will make a difference. There will be employers watching, and it will impact your reputation. As we get older and older, we have progressively fewer opportunities to make mistakes and still get away with it. While we’re still in college, perhaps it’s OK to make a number error on a problem set; perhaps we’ll still get a little bit of partial credit. But in the future, when Princeton students get real jobs, human error will be a big deal. It could mean millions of dollars, servers crashing, a man dying on the operating table. The funny thing is that all this cynicism was inspired by a very trivial matter. Last year, I locked myself out of my single and had to visit the housing department for a temporary prox 17 times. This year, the housing department is charging $30 for temporary proxes after the third use. There is a monetary penalty for my forgetfulness now; if I make mistakes, I have to literally pay for them. At first I was indignant about this new policy, just as I was indignant about the exclusivity of extracurriculars last year and about the scrutiny with which COS TAs graded program comments. But that’s just what college does. It makes you realize your mistakes in ways you might not have in the past. But the good thing about this is that even if mistakes matter now, it’s still not real life yet. If I lock myself out of my room again, it’ll cost me $30, but it’ll only affect me. It won’t affect my coworkers, my company, my clients, my patients or my students. In college, it’s still all about the results, but the results don’t have to be perfect just yet. Even though our mistakes will start to hurt now, we still have time to make them and learn from them.|~|Barbara Zhan is a sophomore from Plainsboro, N.J.

40679|~|Avoiding the academic bottleneck|~|   September 23 2013|~|Column | Sept. 23 |~|Spencer Shen|~|None|~|This semester, the computer science department decided to officially rescind the non-pass/D/fail designation for COS 126: General Computer Science, after instituting it for 126, COS 217: Introduction to Programming Systems and COS 226: Algorithms and Data Structures last semester. Although a large number of the students who take COS 126 each semester are engineering or computer science majors who cannot P/D/F the class anyway, there are also many students for whom COS 126 is not a required course. Computer science and programming are becoming more and more ubiquitous in nearly every academic field, and for many students, COS 126 is not any less worthwhile just because it is not a required course. Some students who take a course P/D/F do so to take care of a distribution requirement with minimum effort, but others P/D/F a course because they are doing poorly despite their best efforts and want to prevent their GPA from suffering because of it. COS 126 probably does not attract too many students looking for an easy QR course, but the P/D/F option allows students with little or no experience in programming to take the course without worrying about grades, which are always a concern when large introductory courses combine with the grade deflation policy. However, as mentioned in a previous editorial on allowing the P/D/F option for foreign language courses, the idea of potentially taking a hit to their GPAs is enough to discourage many such students from taking a course like COS 126. In fact, the non-P/D/F policy is often used in smaller classes, such as language courses or seminars, to do exactly that. Professors or departments usually employ the non-P/D/F policy when they want to avoid taking on students who would not be fully committed to taking the course. In a 20-student seminar, a few students taking the course P/D/F and not being actively engaged in discussion would be detrimental to the entire class. In a lower-level foreign language class where creating an immersive environment is the ideal, a single apathetic student in a class of 11 or 12 can ruin the experience for everyone as well. Most lecture courses allow the P/D/F option, since these concerns are greatly diluted once the class size surpasses 30, and the students are facing a podium and a blackboard instead of each other. Professors already have the ability to set a hard limit on the number of students who can enroll in a course, so non-P/D/F is not the only way to screen for halfhearted students. Unfortunately, the complaints that enacting the non-P/D/F policy would discourage non-engineering majors become somewhat frivolous in the face of scarcity, in which case the department clearly cannot be generous and must conduct a sort of “academic triage” on the prospective COS 126 students. The original intent behind applying the non-P/D/F policy to COS 126, 217 and 226 was to decrease the number of students in these courses, since COS 126 in particular had become a very popular course recently. This was not successful, as the enrollment for the course was about 40 students more than in the previous spring semester. Perhaps the increase in BSE and computer science majors cannot be balanced out even by discouraging potential P/D/F students. The real problem of having a very large COS 126 class is not that Friend 101 or McCosh 10 are too small, but rather that there are simply not enough preceptors, graders and lab TAs to go around. Despite complaints about some of the professors and preceptors, the general consensus seems to be that COS 126 is a well-designed course, which is part of the reason for its popularity. The quality of a course like COS 126, although it is a large lecture class, can be difficult to maintain when enrollment increases dramatically, as it has over the last few semesters. The non-P/D/F policy is used by professors to maintain the integrity of the course in most other cases, and the computer science department has every right to do the same with COS 126, 217 and 226. In fact, with the quickly increasing number of computer science majors, it could even be argued that the department has an obligation to “protect” its own majors and ensure that they will be able to take these classes. A prospective BSE or computer science student, who definitely won’t P/D/F the course, needs that COS 126 spot, while a humanities or social science student interested in programming merely wants that spot. While some students take COS 126 out of pure curiosity and later decide to major in computer science because of it, the non-P/D/F designation would not drive away truly interested students and keeping COS 217 and 226 non-P/D/F still creates an academic bottleneck, only further down the line. It is not a fun decision to make, but the computer science department should realize that unless it can completely restructure a course like COS 126 to accommodate more students, a non-P/D/F designation is the best way to ration out the course to those who absolutely need to take it.|~|Spencer Shen is a sophomore from Houston, Texas.

40735|~|The equal of two evils|~|   September 23 2013|~|Column | Sept. 23 |~|Lea Trusty|~|None|~|This past Saturday, as I was getting dressed to go out, I heard indecipherable shouts coming from outside (call it luck of the first floor). I was waiting for my own pickups, so naturally my roommates and I dashed to the common room window to get a better look. Instead of hearing the sweet sounds of African a cappella, I heard random mathematical symbols. “Are they chanting epsilon?” my roomie Jackie asked. “And delta … ?” Luckily, a friend who was over was able to fill us in on what was happening: Greek rush. I felt a little bad for being out of the loop, but then I realized that for a whole year Greek life had been completely nonexistent to me and that, more likely than not, it would continue to be so. With such small numbers on campus and such trouble from the University’s administration, this is not surprising. Imagine Greek life as a pesky fly in the kitchen. As you’re cooking meals and spending time with family around the table, you hear an incessant buzzing. It annoys you enough that you try to end the poor thing’s life, but because the likelihood of killing it is so low, you settle for swatting it away. This is essentially the way in which fraternities and sororities are treated on this campus. I cannot say that Greek life would interest me personally. I have two older sisters and the majority of my friends are women, so any more “sisters” and I would probably lose count. I am also well aware of the darker sides of Greek life — among them socioeconomic and ethnic divisiveness, high-risk drinking, ridiculous initiations and occasionally crude hazing. But I think it is extremely hypocritical to argue that these qualities are only found in Greek life. Every eating club on this campus holds a stereotype based on its membership, and within each stereotype is a reliable modicum of truth. Some are more diverse than others, some have wealthier members than others and some seem to dedicate themselves to determining how much Beast can cover the floor in one night. And while the bickering of most clubs involves simple socialization or games, some are inevitably more, ahem, unattractive. And so, during this rare moment when Princeton Greek life is on my mind, I wonder why this very thing is so adamantly fought by the Princeton administration when similar entities already exist. The only conclusion I can draw is that eating clubs will forever be “quintessentially Princeton,” and, though Greek life is starkly similar, it would be seen as detracting from the established image of the University. Everything that Greek life is stereotypically known for could be deemed the antithesis of the image Princeton aims to project. Picture obnoxiously loud music, even more obnoxious undergraduates with red Solo cups or bedazzled, overly large coffee mugs in hand, running amok in every corner of campus and town. However, the only major difference between this and a night on the Street is allowing yourself to run amok under the name and protection of an “eating club.” Compare the following two images: The first, a “frat bro” in his casual wifebeater and baseball cap — backwards, of course — stumbling about after a few drinks. The second, a bicker club member, in a casual powder blue button down and shorts, also a tad drunk. Let’s even give him a British accent, to offset frat bro’s baseball cap. Though both of these men are equally drunk and will be getting equally sloppy in a few short moments, there remains one important difference: The bro has the frat stereotype hanging over his head — wild, unkempt, unruly — while the bicker club member represents all that defines eating clubs, embodying qualities of collected coolness and the refinement of Princeton itself. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging and hoping to avoid the pitfalls that an active Greek life can bring to a campus. I think a sustained dialogue on the implications of such groups should be encouraged. Still, to turn a blind eye toward other institutions that so closely resemble fraternities and sororities is plainly unjust and displays unfair partiality towards such institutions. Because when push comes to shove, eating clubs and Greek life are similar, in that they provide a social hub during our years of undergraduate education and help establish connections of all forms for the years beyond. This alone should be reason enough to ease the stringent policies the University has so persistently, unfairly maintained.|~| Lea Trusty is a sophomore from Saint Rose, La.

40751|~|Divided attention|~|   September 23 2013|~|Column | Sept. 23 |~|Shruthi Deivasigamani|~|   Associate Opinion Editor     |~|It was around midnight one Saturday over the summer, and I was piled in a friend’s living room with about five other people. It was the night that George Zimmerman had been acquitted in the Trayvon Martin case. My friends and I had been watching some sugary B-rate teen movie, but upon realizing what had just happened, we switched the channel over to the news and began wordlessly scrolling through various forms of social media, gauging the nation’s reaction to the evening’s events. There were a variety of responses — some were relieved; some were disgusted. But worse than actual interpretations of the trial’s results were reactions that went along the lines of “Quit talking about it — there are more important things to be worrying about in the world.” If we’re being relative about it, there’s always something worse out there in the world. You might be tired after a grueling week of finals, but some kid in Southeast Asia can’t even go to school. You might have just broken your ankle, but a soldier just had his entire leg blown off during bloody crossfire. While it’s true that someone else somewhere else is suffering more, it doesn’t make anything you might be going through any less legitimate. Everyone has their own set of issues and problems, and dismissing them because they aren’t important to you is just as cold as dismissing someone’s hobbies because you would never take them up yourself. The same way, there’s been a growing trend of dismissing “petty” domestic affairs in favor of the “more important” international conflicts. Just this past week, the newly crowned Indian-American Miss America came under undue, rather racist criticism for not being the blonde, white paragon of American beauty. However, just as dialogue about America being a melting pot opened up across the Internet and other media outlets, even more criticism flooded in for discussing the matter of Miss America in the first place. Various tweets called out the debate for being silly, because beauty pageants are apparently shallow and vapid. While this may or may not be the case, the fact still remains that crowning an Indian-American Miss America made history that night, and it deserves to be recognized. Just as I saw earlier in the summer, people were chastising the American public for being so focused on a domestic beauty pageant when there were more pressing matters to be dealt with abroad in Syria. It might sound logical, but in reality, it’s a little condescending. Even in the case of the Miss America controversy, though beauty pageants are often looked at as superficial and inconsequential, the racist comments were reflective of a bigger cultural problem across the country. While it may be true that the Trayvon Martin case might have more far-reaching implications than the Miss America pageant, they’re both important matters to discuss and don’t deserve to be constantly brushed off as “trivial” in light of international issues. Most matters that are brushed off as “petty” or “insignificant” are often ones that deal with the intangible — attitudes, notions and beliefs. It’s easy to dismiss the entire Miss America controversy because “we have better things to be worrying about.” But when it exposes a major trend in attitudes, it’s worth discussion. It’s not hogging airtime. When late-night talk show hosts rip apart racist notions, it sheds light on harmful ways of thinking and helps change them. This is just as important as discussing international affairs, and arguably even more helpful, as it’s a manner of directly inducing change. We don’t always have to be talking about the most distressing, depressing news at any given moment. Our attentions are not undivided, and our attentions are not identical. International matters don’t have to capture every single person’s interest. It’s important to be a well-educated populace, but a populace isn’t comprised of identical constituents. A well-educated populace can come from complementary pieces, each contributing something worthwhile and different.|~|Shruthi Deivasigamani is a sophomore from Cresskill, N.J.

40475|~|Lancing the bubble|~|   September 22 2013|~|Column | Sept. 22 |~|James Di Palma-Grisi|~|   Columnist     |~|In sufficiently complex economies (i.e., anything but a colonial “cottage industry”), the essential element is specialization — an electrician might not know how to cultivate plants, but this doesn’t practically worsen the quality of the person as an electrician. We might be deeply and intuitively connected with a particular academic field and in general ignorance of another, yet this might not impact our core competency. Somewhat counterintuitively, as we wade back to the shores of everyday life, the information we lose becomes more essential, and building an informational silo seems harmful: not as a result of excluding the information in other silos, but rather through containing one’s own expertise apart from the wider world. Critical thinking and general intellectual confidence are both predicated on interacting with a cross-section of the world, not a horizontal slice. The reality of cultural distinctiveness can become a siren of cultural superiority, which — should either lead to isolation — can quickly lead down the path to fluid-intellectual softening and a resistance to novel situations. Both processes have similar weaknesses: Specialization can lead to a narrowing of intellectual focus in the pursuit of persistence, but not necessarily flourishing, in one’s employment, and cultural isolation can cause — mainly through what it doesn’t include — a comparative incompetence in new scenarios. Yet our Orange Bubble is often seen as a positive element, or, at worst, as a necessary or situational problem. We somehow feel that intellectual rigorousness crowds out everything else, that outside the campus map lie distractions, things to be avoided as long as possible, profane contaminants of the Orange Bubble. How much of our common culture, I wonder, is a result of the Bubble itself? It seems more reasonable to conclude that what brought us to Princeton in the first place is what binds us, not a particular chant or book, and certainly not a negative definition against other institutions. It might be instructive to examine just what Princeton meant to one of its most iconic participants. Woodrow Wilson believed the Presbyterian-minister founders of the University had a broad, inclusive (for the time) institution of higher learning in mind and praised the secularity of the royal charter, which “never said a word about creed or doctrine.” The charter was a legal document, but this attitude was indicative of the college’s later development, which had in some part occurred by the time of the speech. In that 1896 document, “Princeton in the Nation’s Service,” Wilson exposits the links between the University and colonial, later revolutionary New Jersey: “Conceive it but liberally enough, [religion] is the true salt wherewith to keep both duty and learning [against] time and change.” There was some evidence that the University was founded with broad-based education in mind: Correspondence with the colonial governor mentions “true religion and good literature.” Curiously, instead of too strong a culture, the early decades were peppered with quite the opposite problem.  “[The College] had been brought to Princeton in the very midst of the French and Indian War … The Stamp Act agitation had come … New Jersey did not, like Virginia and Massachusetts, easily form her purpose in that day of anxious doubt … and suffered a turbulence of spirit.” In the context of Wilson’s speech, the University was cast as an essential component of the world, and the notion of a self-imposed Orange Bubble would have been anathema. How much of the founding conditions, and John Witherspoon’s essential role as a stabilizing force, were a result of Princeton’s geographical location and individual character? While overseeing the University for a quarter-century, Witherspoon was also instrumental in the American Revolution, and students lit bonfires at the news of the Declaration of Independence. Yet this seems remarkably contextual: With Hessian Jaegers and British Regulars crisscrossing the state, and with both the Continental Congress and an imperial cannonball lodging in Nassau Hall, it rightly seems that Princeton, more than most of the state, had quite enough contact with the outside world. In an aside on the difference between history and literature, Wilson continues: “It is one thing to sit here in republican America and hear a credible professor tell of the soil of allegiance in which the British monarchy grows, and quite another to live where her Majesty is Queen and hear common men bless her with full confession and loyalty.” Just the same, there is a difference between social philosophy and practical volunteering, or even between an academic paper and a cross-disciplinary conference. While the challenges of 2013 are far from columns of Imperials across the Hudson, we ought not to lose the revolutionary zeal of the Witherspoon era. In a post-Cold War, omnipresent cable-news world, we might simply be rationally skeptical of “big ideas.” Should we then be wary of them as a category? We might need a broad cultural revision to keep pace with Wilson’s charge: “The men who founded Princeton were pastors, not ecclesiastics. Their ideal was the service of congregations and communities.” While we can certainly salt duty and learning against change, we ought to be equally vigilant guarding it from our own laurels.|~|James Di Palma-Grisi  is a psychology major from Glen Rock, N.J.

40516|~|Privacy through transparency |~|   September 22 2013|~|Column | Sept. 22 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|The summer before freshman year, I was excited to receive my email address and see my name placed beside the email subdomain “@princeton.edu”: a confirmation that my acceptance wasn’t some mistake by the Office of Admission. Amid the anticipation and the news of Princeton going Google, the thought of my privacy ever being at risk was never a concern. However, in the age of protest over drones and the NSA, the issue of privacy has come to the forefront. Although it has been discussed before by opinion columnist Catherine Rampell ’07 in 2006, maybe now, more than ever, we should take the time to brush the dust off the handbooks given to us freshman year and review Princeton’s stance on its students’ privacy. According to the University’s IT policy, the University is allowed “under certain circumstances to access, restrict, monitor and regulate the systems that support and contain [all contents in storage on data and voice systems]” and also “reserves the right to access and copy files and documents (including e-mail and voicemail) residing on University-owned equipment. This includes access without notice, where warranted.” The school’s email client, Google, has a stance on privacy that also raises some eyebrows. This summer in a federal case over the automated processing of emails from Gmail, Google cited Smith v. Maryland (1976) to justify its ability to look at users’ data, stating “a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.” While the school’s IT policy highlights that students are normally “afforded a high degree of privacy” with regard to the school’s technology, it fails to mention what these “certain circumstances” are, and more importantly, who would be allowed to invade your privacy if such circumstances were met. Privacy has historically been a tricky subject. It technically isn’t even explicitly mentioned in our own Constitution — and wasn’t recognized as a constitutional right until the 1960s contraceptive case Griswold v. Connecticut, in which the Court claimed that various amendments created penumbras that formed “zones of privacy.” Added to the fact that the Founding Fathers had no way of conceiving of cell phones, cars and Internet, the problem of privacy becomes a whole lot trickier. For example, in Olmstead v. United States — a Supreme Court case dealing with the constitutionality of phone-wire tapping in the 1920s — the Court, applying a more literal view of privacy, argued that since telephone wires were not part of a person’s house, telephone conversations were not protected by the Fourth Amendment’s search and seizure clause. Although the decision was overturned by Katz v. United States (1967), it reflects a past difficulty of grasping privacy in light of new technological innovations. More notably, in one of Olmstead’s dissents, Justice Brandeis argued the Court took the wrong approach with its decision. He believed that “government is potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.” That’s not to say that I believe Princeton is breaking any laws, nor am I accusing it of inciting anarchy. Princeton University is not the United States federal government. That being said, Brandeis still brings up an excellent point. It’s hard to deny that Princeton has a heavy impact on its students. It’s also not inconceivable to imagine that one day many of us might be in positions in which we may have some power to shape privacy policy, either through setting the work policy of the businesses we will work at, through changing the laws our government abides by or through some other means. The way that Princeton handles its privacy could shape our expectations for privacy and thus indirectly affect privacy policies in places beyond the University. In defense of Google’s stance towards privacy, Eric Schmidt ’76, Google CEO, argued that “if you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.”  This is the wrong approach. The burden of protecting our privacy should not rest on the students, as Eric Schmidt and Catherine Rampell suggest. Rather, it should rest on those who set the policy. That’s not to say that the University should be completely prohibited from accessing student information. It should have that ability. As a school, there are times where it is necessary, such as assisting in a criminal investigation. That being said, it seems a tad ironic that our privacy is dictated by a vague policy that in and of itself keeps some information private from us. While privacy is not absolute, it shouldn’t be violated under murky circumstances. Ambiguity and lack of care toward privacy by those in charge set a dangerous precedent of being seen as acceptable by our generation. In doing so, the University’s unclear privacy policy only hurts the very students that it aims to protect — and even worse, risks affecting those with no connection to the University at all.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn.

40477|~|Correcting the mistake of Dean West|~|   September 22 2013|~|Editorial | Sept. 22 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|This October will mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Graduate College. In 1913, Dean Andrew Fleming West won a battle against then-University President Woodrow Wilson, who had fought to have a newly created graduate program centered within the undergraduate-dominated central campus. While Dean West’s victory created one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture belonging to Princeton, it has left a legacy of separation between the undergraduate and graduate populations — both physically and figuratively. The Board believes that this gulf is detrimental to the mission of the University and the educational enrichment of both undergraduates and graduates.   Graduate students can offer the intellectual and personal experiences that undergraduates yearn for without the intimidation that professors can naturally — through no fault of their own — pose. Often approachable, graduate students can offer undergraduates valuable advice. And yet, Princeton remains a place where graduate students are marginalized by an undergraduate-dominated campus. Interactions are relegated to formal, infrequent precepts confined to a particular topic and the few Residential Graduate Students that have agreed to live in the residential colleges.   Many of our most prestigious alumni — including Alan Turing GS ’38 and John Nash GS ’50 — were graduate students, not undergraduates, during their time at Princeton. With bright careers in the professional and academic world ahead of them, graduate students can assist students with tackling the academic rigors of Princeton. A graduate student’s account of his or her personal research can inspire an undergraduate to undertake a particular course of study, or a graduate student can help an upperclassman think about his or her independent work in a new way. The academic possibilities are many.   Along with their intellectual capacity, graduate students bring life experiences that are varied and rich: tremendous resources to young undergraduates who have yet to have an extended taste of the world outside of Princeton. While many graduate students come directly from undergraduate institutions, just as many come to Princeton with years of unique experiences outside of academia. Those who have come directly from undergraduate institutions can provide an understanding of the college experience outside of Princeton, giving undergraduates a better sense of what it means to be an undergraduate at Princeton. The Board urges the University to take seriously the problem of the undergraduate-graduate rift and to explore as many solutions as prudently possible. Princeton is and should remain an undergraduate-focused institution, but that does not necessitate the separation of undergraduates and graduates. In fact, to enhance the undergraduate focus, interactions between undergraduates and graduates should not be limited to formal precepts and the occasional Residential Graduate Student. Rather, the undergraduate-graduate interaction should be a daily affair, both informal and formal, creating a rich and varied campus experience. Perhaps the role of the RGS should be formalized into the RCA’s orientation activities for freshmen, giving them an official introduction immediately. Outside of RGSs, departments should aim to create a mentoring program by pairing graduate students in the department with undergraduates. Such mentoring can play a beneficial role in undergraduates’ research and independent work. These are but two suggestions for how graduate-student interaction with undergrads might be strengthened. The Board recognizes that this problem lacks easy solutions, but it nevertheless deserves the careful attention of the administration and student body.|~|
40552|~|Letter to the Editor: Why no Bible used at Eisgruber's installation?|~|   September 22 2013|~|Letter to the Editor | Sept. 22 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|It was with surprise, and a great deal of sadness, that I read “No Bible would be used in the Sept. 22 installation of Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber” (The Daily Princetonian, Sept. 19, 2013). I enthusiastically supported Eisgruber’s selection as president. He is a gifted constitutional scholar, and his many years as provost made him, in my view, the ideal candidate for the position. I assumed Eisgruber was a liberal, as are virtually all academics at Princeton, but I believed his core values and beliefs were strong and that he valued and respected the history and traditions of the University. With dismay I now realize that Eisgruber’s decisions are controlled by the prevailing political correctness that permeates the Princeton University campus. Sincerely, Beverly T.

40169|~|The cost of the Pequod|~|   September 20 2013|~|Editorial | Sept. 20 |~|Editorial Board|~|None|~|One of the first things students do upon arriving on campus is purchase their course books. Fortunately, Labyrinth Books has simplified this process by streamlining how University students order their course readings as well as by offering an annual University discount. Yet, some courses require students to venture to the U-Store to purchase bound photocopies of readings through Pequod, which can often be expensive and environmentally unsustainable. The Board believes that University professors and administrators should strive to minimize the use of Pequods by relying on more sustainable and affordable alternatives. Many textbooks are expensive, but Labyrinth is not the sole provider of most of the reading materials University students require. If students find that they cannot afford a book from Labyrinth, there are a variety of other options available. This is simply not the case for the materials included in Pequods. If a student cannot afford a course’s Pequod, which can cost as much as $134, there are no available alternatives. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Pequods for courses often change from one semester to the next, depriving students of the opportunity to purchase used Pequods. The Board is sensitive to the printing costs and copyright restrictions Pequod encounters in assembling its packets. The Electronic Course Reserve Service, however, offers a solution to these copyright restrictions, as it allows the University to work with publishers to expand the library’s collection of e-reserve materials. While the University would incur a cost in expanding its e-reserve materials, increasing the accessibility of reading materials to students is surely a goal deserving of substantial University support. Not only are Pequods expensive to purchase, but they also are contrary to the University’s long-standing goal to implement environmentally sustainable practices on campus. Printing hundreds of photocopies each semester is wasteful. Uploading these photocopies as a PDF through e-reserves would not only reduce costs for students, but it would also further the University’s commitment to sustainability. The Board does recognize that students often print e-reserve readings, but we still believe the move would reduce dependence on paper, especially in light of the print quota that allows the University to monitor and regulate student printing patterns. In addition to the mere cost, Pequod’s return policy and payment options are also financially burdensome. At no point are students allowed full refunds — only 75 percent and 50 percent returns are available after the first 10 and 20 days of classes, respectively. After the first 20 days of classes, students are unable to make any returns. This burdens students who are unsure of which courses they will ultimately decide to take. Labyrinth, by contrast, allows students to receive a full refund within a specified time period. Further, students are required to purchase Pequods with cash, credit or debit, foregoing the student charge. The student charge allows students to either delay payment or use University credit or loans. Student charge thereby allows students to more easily access course materials. If Pequods are to remain a component of University courses, the University should work with Pequod to make the student charge option available. Eliminating Pequods is likely not the most practical solution. However, if courses rely more on services like e-reserves, the volume of materials submitted to Pequod is reduced, thereby decreasing the size and cost of Pequods. And if the University establishes a closer relationship with Pequod, our needs as students can be met in a way that does not create unnecessary financial burdens in accessing required course materials.|~|
40215|~|Honor|~|   September 20 2013|~|Column | Sept. 19 |~|Benjamin Dinovelli|~|   Executive Opinion Editor     |~|“I pledge my honor that I have not violated the Honor Code during this examination.” Since the beginning of my short Princeton career, I have written these words on every single examination I have ever taken. Established by members of the undergraduate class in 1893, the Honor Code serves as a symbol to a student’s commitment not to cheat. Last week, I wrote an article titled “What’s wrong with cheating?” in relation to the recent survey given by The Harvard Crimson to its freshman class, which revealed that 42 percent of them had cheated on a homework assignment prior to arriving on the grasses of Harvard Yard. In my article, I addressed the risk of exploitable gray areas created by new technologies that an antiquated honor system could not have predicted. In a recent letter to the editor, Assistant Dean of the College Elizabeth L. Colagiuri highlighted a video posted on the Office of the Dean of the College’s website in order to spur a conversation about these issues, and I thank her for that. However, it’s important to recognize that following the Honor Code consists of more than simply just not cheating on a test, but also includes “report[ing] a violation within a reasonable period of time.” In his opening speech, less than two weeks ago, President Eisgruber ’83 highlighted the virtue of honor. Citing Princeton professor Kwame Anthony Appiah’s book “The Honor Code,” he warned that while honor “can help to sustain us in our pursuit of our own good,” it “can also lead to self-destructive behavior.” As Appiah claims in his book, “honor is an entitlement to respect that’s governed by some code or other.” In particular, Appiah’s book deals with English duels, the Chinese practice of foot binding and slavery within the British Empire. With all three, he concludes that while honor had fueled these activities, even in light of moral opposition, it was also honor — the loss of respect for them — in the end that eventually led to their demises. While Eisgruber turned his focus on the fraternity system — equating hazing rituals with English duels — I feel his focus is aimed in the wrong direction. Despite the infamy that fraternities have gained nationwide, there is a much larger, unaddressed problem within Princeton’s own gates. As one Princeton sophomore said, “There’s a 100 percent chance that I would never report someone I know for cheating.” Another said that “only in situations seriously detrimental to the class” would he go out of his way to report someone. Let’s face it, there is a very negative stigma associated with reporting your peers, arguably even worse than cheating itself. As one student interviewed jokingly put it, “snitches get stitches” — it is just not seen as acceptable to rat a fellow student out. The same close-knit bond that Princeton builds gives you every incentive not to report someone you don’t know that well, let alone someone you know closely, for cheating. In a sense, this very concept of honor that the University has drilled into our heads — since the very minute we stepped foot onto campus — leads to this dual nature of honor that Eisgruber warned about. The very sense of honor that we have toward our fellow students undermines the Honor Code. It isn’t necessarily bad; I think it’s a good thing for students to have that close bond. Unfortunately, I think an inherent flaw is the inability of upholding the second part of the Honor Code — a necessary trade-off. Realistically, the status quo is not going to change. The chances for punishment are slim; after all, who has heard of a case where someone has actually been punished for neglecting to report another person’s cheating? And even if someone did, how can you gain the physical evidence the Honor Committee requires to not have the “he said, she said” dilemma that the committee tries to avoid? Nor would I expect the Honor Committee to reward anyone for doing so. In doing so, you would create much worse consequences than the current status quo. What does this say about the culture at Princeton? In an effort to build a strong community of respect, part of the code, that Appiah refers to earlier, appears to be respecting others by remaining silent — even in the face of witnessing cheating. Those who have read Appiah’s book may retort that we need to have a paradigm shift by creating a system where we respect those who report on others. I disagree. This is a mentality that we cannot simply turn a blind eye to. The first step we need to take is acknowledgement.|~|Benjamin Dinovelli is a sophomore from Mystic, Conn.

40165|~|Outside the Bubble: A practical take on Syria|~|   September 19 2013|~|Column |~|Aaron Applbaum|~|None|~|In these pages, we aim to print pieces that engage with and comment on our campus, our community and our lives as students. But we also appreciate that the interests of our columnists and our readers do not exist solely within the FitzRandolph gates. Once a week, one of our columnists will write on a national or international issue in our new “Outside the Bubble” series. We hope that this series will spark debate, discussion and dialogue among the members of our campus community. For good reason, Syria, Russia and chemical weapons are all buzzwords that have dominated newspapers the past month. Given the tremendous humanitarian problems and strained domestic and international relationships, this should be the case. As a media consumer, I find there is an issue with the dramatic nature of this news coverage — there seems to be a rather sensationalist approach to the reporting. The concerns aired in the unsleeping 24-hour news cycle all make the discourse melodramatic.  Discussion of a loss in U.S. hegemony, American un-exceptionalism, strained U.S.-Russian diplomatic relationships and implications of Iranian misinterpretation of U.S. intentions are all major issues that have managed to draw attention to an important world of political theory, but in the process, these issues have mostly drowned out very important discourse on some of the more practical elements of what it means to get rid of Syrian chemical weapons. There seems to be a dearth of discussion on the pragmatic nature of removing stockpiles of material. It is estimated that Syria has more than 1,000,000 pounds of chemical weapons; how is that going to be thoroughly and permanently removed?  In all the discussion of who exerts an increasing amount of influence in “the region,” how is it that fundamental questions of operation are obscured from the public eye? All the colorful media coverage and fast-paced decision-making should not obscure the important fact that the magnitude of the discussed operations in Syria is formidable (not that it shouldn’t be carried out). According to political analysis website Stratfor, getting rid of million(s) of pounds of hazardous weaponry will take years, and the operation might not be thorough enough to get rid of all the material and certainly won’t eliminate the possibility that these weapons are used in the short term. According to National Public Radio, standard procedure for chemical weapons disposal involves complete incineration of all of the components. The incineration of these weapons should not be understood to be a simple task; it is a long and technical process that involves separating the chemical agent from its container or munitions and destroying it, then cautiously destroying anything that contains the hazardous material, including unexploded artillery packaging. This process is extremely laborious because much of the weaponry is decades old and may have suffered decay and is often unstable. When there was discussion of a potential U.S./Israeli invasion into Iran, there was abundant discourse about the quantity and impenetrability of the nuclear sites. There was discourse about the type of machinery necessary to undertake the operations as well as ample discussion of Iranian capability timelines. All of these practical and important elements are shockingly quiet in the current discussion of Syria. Would it be preferable to put the collection and movement of chemical weapons in the hands of the Syrians?  The weapons could be transported to a single location for assessment and destruction, which would minimize the number of U.S. (and ally) specialists on the ground and allow for them to be concentrated in a single location. On the other hand, however, this implies a certain trust of Assad, of which he is undeserving. How would the United States be able to fully verify that the material was brought from the disparate stockpiles? Also, some of the sites have been taken over by rebel forces — are we to believe that they would cooperate? Another side of this debate should entertain the idea of boots on the ground — that Americans and allies be sent to the known storage, research and production locations in order to protect them from both the rebels and the Assad regime. In a brief to the U.S. Congress, plans crafted by the U.S. DoD estimated that at least 75,000 ground troops would be needed for this option (excluding the number of personnel and assets required to support the ground force in maneuver). This option is thorough and trustworthy, but I don’t believe a war-fatigued America would take too kindly to this route. Also, given the dispersed nature of this approach, there would need to be many more chemical weapons specialists on the ground. Personnel would be disseminated over a large area in the middle of a dangerous combat zone. Even under ideal conditions, this process would likely take years to accomplish, and the costs would be high. Clearly, I have not exhausted the potential methods of carrying out the removal of chemical weapons from Syria, but, interestingly, neither have political pundits and other news sources. I believe it is important to note that whatever type of action is pursued, destruction of the stockpiles cannot be ensured fully. There will always be personnel at risk, and there will always be the chance that chemical weapons will still be used despite the efforts underway. The process will be expensive and will take years to realistically accomplish. While it may not be the most sensational side of the Syrian discussion, it is still important for this form of discourse to be prevalent in today’s news outlets.|~|Aaron Applbaum is a Wilson School major from Oakland, Calif.

39984|~|Veterans add to 'diversity'|~|   September 18 2013|~|Column | Sept. 18 |~|Guest Contributor|~|None|~|By Uwe Reinhardt Princeton University’s Ad Hoc Committee on Diversity delivered its final report to the public a few days ago. Having served on University committees in the past, I know how much time, research, thought and discussion went into the report, for which the University community should be grateful, as I am. One does not have to take issue with what is in the report to notice the conspicuous absence of one dimension of diversity. On page 9 of the report, one finds a long list of characteristics of diversity that “may shape an individual’s worldview,” among them gender, race/ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, age, citizenship and life experience. Notably absent from this catalogue is the life experience of individuals who have served this country in the military — especially those who have served in combat zones abroad. In my view, they deserve explicit mention in any serious discussion on diversity. I would not howl here into the wind with the theme that our nation owes veterans a debt of gratitude, especially those who for so many years worked and suffered on far-away combat duty. Most veterans I know are sober enough not to expect all that much on that score from the rest of society. That so many veterans remain unemployed speaks volumes. Instead, I write here about the valuable perspectives these veterans’ life experiences could add to a campus that seriously seeks a greater diversity of perspectives in its community. For starters, our armed forces arguably represent the most amazingly effective educational institution in the country. Our military recruits youngsters from the socioeconomic strata routinely overlooked by higher education. With discipline and idealism, they forge the motley crews they take in into racially and ethnically integrated communities with a great variety of highly technical skills — a community with a unique sense of honor and willingness to sacrifice for members of their community and for the country at large. These are characteristics and perspectives less commonly found outside the military. If I were the Dean of the College, you can bet that I would always have on my staff some ex-military men and women, perchance even a drill instructor. Who knows better how to deal with rambunctious young people of diverse backgrounds, to exhort them to greater things and, just as importantly, to develop in them that personal “bearing,” as the military call it, that might make college students think twice before ending up drunker than skunks in a hospital’s emergency room, there to shame their community by begging for succor from the consequences of their own folly? I would imagine also that a faculty member with a military background would bring valuable perspectives to the class room. Who would know better how tough moral choices are actually made, sometimes under the most bewildering and strenuous circumstances and in split seconds, or how to ration scarce resources? The typical faculty member can imagine and theorize about such choices. It might help sometimes to have actually faced such choices. One final point. It may be thought that I put finger to word processor here mainly because my own son is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. Not so. I have been an admirer and friend of America’s military long before he was born, going back to the time when I was a child. I have written in the Princeton Alumni Weekly tributes to our military when our Marine was still in kindergarten, and I served on the Veteran Administration’s Special Medical Advisory Committee during the Reagan Administration. When my children were small, we visited American military cemeteries in Europe with them, there to show our respect and gratitude and to show my children a glorious part of their American heritage. This column is not about my son. It is about American veterans, period, and it is about a potential benefit to our community that this University may overlook to its disadvantage.|~|Uwe Reinhardt is a James Madison Professor of Political Economy and a professor of economics and public affairs.  He can be reached at reinhard@princeton.edu. 
39988|~|The merits of fresh blood|~|   September 18 2013|~|Column | Sept. 18 |~|Spencer Shen|~|None|~|Toward the end of last year, as most of us were trying to figure out which classes to take this semester, the subject of good and bad professors often came up when my friends and I were trying to choose courses. For the best and worst ones, all one has to do is scan through the evaluations on ICE or go to a website like RateMyProfessor in order to gauge the general consensus. However, even when the official course evaluations don’t have much to say about a certain professor, word of mouth works just as well. For example, when the economics department decided to change up the assignment of professors to courses this year, word spread quickly that Harvey Rosen would be teaching ECO 100: Introduction to Microeconomics in the fall instead of in the spring, and long before the official course catalog came out, many students knew that Rosen was going to be the fall term professor. A cursory glance through previous years’ evaluations for ECO 100 is enough to determine that Rosen is one of the most popular and well-liked professors for the course, one of the select few who can make a full house at McCosh 50, which seats a whopping 480 students, seem like a small class. However, Rosen isn’t a good professor because it pays more; he teaches well because he wants to. The administration provides no real incentive for faculty to expend any effort in teaching, yet teaching is often required as part of a research fellowship or grant. This problem is most apparent with tenured faculty, who need to merely go through the motions to continue to do research, knowing they cannot be affected by a negative reputation as a teacher. A poorly taught upper-level course would quickly lose its students, but this is not necessarily the case for introductory courses if the students enrolled in it have to take the course as a prerequisite for the major they are interested in. Such students would have to stick with the course despite the sub-par lecturer. However, the students that take intro courses to get a taste of a potential major can be completely discouraged from majoring in that field just because of one or two bad experiences with the quality of teaching in such introductory courses. While there are certainly professors who are simply incapable of making lectures engaging and interesting, most of the time the problem is a lack of motivation, not a lack of ability. The problem is that the University is requiring people uninterested in teaching to teach basic, “boring” courses, without creating any sort of incentive or pressure to do so. Every year there are new professors at Princeton, a small number of which are visiting professors from other schools, where they are usually full-time faculty. In some cases, these visiting professors are at Princeton to do research, but many of them are here on academic fellowships of some sort and are primarily here to teach a course. The general impression seems to be that these visiting professors place more importance on ensuring that students understand the material, even if they might make the courses and the grading slightly easier than usual. Although it’s still early in the semester, the professor for ORF 245: Fundamentals of Engineering Statistics this year, who is at Princeton on a one-year teaching fellowship through the Keller Center, has already established a very different atmosphere from the one that I experienced last year when I shopped the course for a few lectures each semester. A fellowship like this requires a visiting professor to specifically apply for it, knowing that his primary responsibility would be teaching, not research. This kind of self-selection, combined with the selection process for visiting professors, results in the average visiting professor being much more engaging in the lecture hall than the average Princeton professor. The perennial complaints about apathetic and aloof professors seem to revolve mostly around large introductory lecture courses, which are not very numerous and do not require much specialization to teach. As much as Princeton likes to advertise that every professor must teach an undergraduate course to demonstrate how dedicated the University is to undergraduate education, the reality is that many of them greatly prefer to teach fewer students in a more advanced or graduate-level course and view teaching introductory courses as a chore instead of an opportunity. Tenure frees professors from pressure by the administration, but it can also breed apathy, which hurts the students. Perhaps the way to circumvent this issue is to have visiting professors teach these courses. They cannot be pushed around by administration but will not be thinking about tenure and research either, and there is probably no shortage of capable and enthusiastic professors who would be willing to spend a year or two at a place like Princeton.|~|Spencer Shen is a sophomore from Houston, Texas.
